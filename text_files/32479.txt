MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a)	to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.    STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 15 TO BE ANSWERED ON 02/02/2022 REGARDING AUCTION OF COAL BLOCKS (a) & (b)   The Ministry of Coal had completed the auction process for  38 coal mines in first round of auction for commercial mining which was launched on June 18, 2020 under CM(SP) Act, 2015 and MMDR Act, 1957. The auction process received a good response from the bidders. Out of 38 mines put on auction, 20 mines were successfully auctioned with a success rate of 53%. List of said 38 coal mines is given at  Annexure enclosed.  (c) & (d)   No request from States has been received for allocating coal blocks to the coal PSUs for exploration.  However, several requests have been received from various State Governments for allotment of coal blocks to their PSUs for extraction of coal. Some coal blocks had been allotted against such requests.  Some requests which were received from State Governments for allotment of coal blocks to their public sector entities but could not be acceded to are as under :- i. Several requests from Hon’ble Chief Minister, Chhattisgarh, Secretary, Mineral Resource Department, Chhattisgarh and Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation were received from time to time for identification of 4 coal blocks namely Tara, Morga-I, Morga-II & Durgapur-II/Sarya for allotment for sale of coal and to give directions to Nominated Authority for inviting NIA for the blocks so identified. Current Status of the above 4 coal blocks is as under: *Tara & Morga-I – As per MoEF & CC, these mines are falling under area which needs to be conserved and should not be considered for mining. Matter in respect of Tara coal mine is sub-judice in Hon’ble Supreme Court and order of status –quo has been passed. *Morga-II – Directions of the Central Government were issued to Nominated Authority for conducting auction of coal mines under CM(SP) Act, 2015 for sale of coal including Morga-II coal mine. However, as requested by Government of Chhattisgarh, the same was withdrawn from the auction process.  *Durgapur-II/Sarya – Allotted to Karnataka Power Corporation Limited for end use Power.  ii.          Several requests have been received from time to time from Hon’ble Chief Minister, Arunachal Pradesh for allotment of Namchik Namphuk Coal mine to Arunachal Pradesh Mineral Development & Trading Corporation Limited [APMDTCL]. In this regard, as per the provisions of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, there is a prescribed process for allocation of coal mines under which coal blocks can be allotted to State Govt. Companies through the Notice Inviting Applications (NIA) route only, unlike provisions for Central Government companies. Accordingly, APMDTCL may apply for allocation of coal blocks as and when applications are invited for allocation of coal blocks/mines through NIA by Ministry of Coal/Nominated Authority. APMDTCL may also participate in auction of coal mines as and when NIT is floated by Ministry of Coal. iii.       Recently, 04 coal blocks viz. Kalyan Khani Block-6, Koyagudem Block-III, Sathupalli Block-III and Shravanapalli located in the Sate of Telangana were offered for allocation by way of Auction for Sale of coal under the provisions of  Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and the rules made thereunder.  Thereafter, the State Govt. of Telangana has requested to cancel the auction of these 04 coal blocks and to allocate them to SCCL.  However, as per the extant policy followed by Ministry of Coal, all the coal blocks are now being offered for allocation by way of auction for sale of coal.  Further, the State Govt. entities including SCCL may participate in auction and take the block(s) as per prescribed norms.  iv.           Directions have also been issued to Nominated Authority for allocation of 02 coal blocks, viz., Garampani and Koilajan located in the State of Assam by way of auction for sale of coal which were also requested by the Govt. of Assam for allocation to its State PSU. The State Government was informed that their PSUs may participate and bid for auction of coal blocks.  It may be stated that the High Level Committee vide their report dated 07.01.2020 has also recommended that Ministry of Coal shall gradually shift towards allocation of coal blocks through  auctions only. After one year, direct allotment route shall be closed except under exceptional circumstances to be determined by Ministry of Coal and PSUs may participate in the auction of coal blocks. Thereafter, since the year 2020, coal blocks have been offered for auction only.**** AnnexureList of 38 coal mines put up in first round of commercial auction  S.
