ANSWER




                                                        (a): There are industry job roles, particularly in the manufacturing sector, where practical component is important for completing skill training. However, in job roles where there can be partial delivery of skilling using on-line modules, blended training can be feasible. Such training using on-line mode can have advantage such as increasing the reach of training, less commutation for trainees, particularly women trainees, etc. On the occasion of the World Youth Skill Day, on 15.07.2021, blended learning in respect of six courses under the Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) for long-term training through the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) was launched. The six courses are namely Electrician, Fitter, Welder, Computer Operator & Programming Assistant, Cosmetology and Diesel Mechanic. The National Skill Development Corporation, under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), has created e-Skill India, a multi-lingual portal, providing e-skilling opportunities to the Indian youth. e-Skill India works collaboratively as an e-Learning aggregator portal by establishing strategic digital skilling partnerships with knowledge partners to bring best-in-class digital opportunities for the Indian youth under one roof. The portal has over 900 e-courses and more than 7.5 lakh enrolments. Majority of e-course on e-Skill India are offered for free. Likewise, the Bharat Skills portal, managed by DGT, is for pursuing long-term training through the digital mode.(b): During the Covid period, a scheme named Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) was launched in June 2020 to address the impact of Covid on migrant workers in India. On the lines of GKRA, MSDE has undertaken demand-driven skilling / orientation for sustainable livelihood opportunities under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). This program is being implemented across 119 districts of 6 States namely Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The total number of migrant workers trained and assessed, State-wise, as on July 10, 2021 is as under:State	Trained	AssessedAssam	714	494Bihar	31,619	28,334Madhya Pradesh	10,598	6,628Odisha	1,690	1,233Rajasthan	12,478	11,227Uttar Pradesh	13,724	11,972Total	70,823	59,888(c) to (e):	The Ministry has not received any skilling proposal from Government of Chhattisgarh during the Covid period. However, the Ministry under the scheme PMKVY 3.0 has allocated physical target of 17,584 to the State of Chhattisgarh with a financial allocation of Rs. 4.86 crore.
