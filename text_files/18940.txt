Under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and the Rules framed thereunder, the State Governments are empowered to carry out auction of mineral blocks in accordance with the prescribed law. As per the information received from respective State Governments, a total of 61 mineral blocks are in pipeline for auction. The state-wise details are at Annexure-II.  c.

An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) has been constituted in the Ministry of Coal on 29.05.2020 for the purpose of coal import substitution.  8 meetings of the IMC have been held.  The IMC provides a platform for discussions on a larger forum with the Administrative Ministries so as to encourage the coal consumers of their respective sector to eliminate imports of coal. IMC has decided that the Administrative Ministries would engage with the coal importers of their sector on a regular basis alongwith coal supplier companies, coal transporters as well as Ministry of Coal to resolve issues, if any, in the coal import substitution.  These meetings provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the sector specific coal related issues and target the individual coal consumers by providing them with domestic coal.  Ministry of Power / Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Ministry of Steel, Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium enterprises (MSME), Ministry of Mines and Ministry of Shipping has conducted meetings with the coal consumers of their sector to understand the reasons for coal imports and also to inform the consumers about the availability of coal and logistic facilities.
