ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a):	National Jute Board (NJB) has been implementing Jute –ICARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) for improvement in production and quality of raw jute under which it has planned to distribute 35 MT of certified jute seeds (JBO 2003 H and CO 58) on subsidized rate in collaboration with Jute Corporation of India (JCI) in the year 2021-22. Also, NJB has planned to distribute 1000 Seed drill machine, 1200 Cycle weeder machine and 750 MT CRIJAF Sona (including NINFET – Sathi). In addition, JCI has planned to commercially distribute 1000 MT of certified seeds ( JRO 204) by sourcing through National Seeds Corporation.(b):	There was no manufacturing of PPE Coveralls in India prior to January, 2020. As per estimates based on the inputs provided by industry, the country has manufactured nearly 6 Crore Body Coveralls during April, 2020 to December, 2020.   Nearly 1100 manufacturers had registered for PPE Body Coveralls manufacturing. The production capacity in the country achieved for PPE Body Coveralls is 4.5 lakh per day.(c) & (d):	The Government of India has provided mandatory packaging of 100% of foodgrains and 20% of sugar in jute bags under the Jute Packaging and Materials (Compulsory use in Packing Commodities) Act, 1987.  In case, jute mills are not able to supply the indented quantity of jute bags, Government has provided a provision of maximum 30% of dilution against the total requirement. The Government exercises the dilution powers to avoid short supply of jute bags for packaging of foodgrains. During the Rabi 2020-21 season i.e. from December, 2019 to June, 2020 a dilution of 7.01 lakh bales was granted to compensate for short supply of jute bags. ***
