ANSWER




                                                        (a): Yes Sir. Government has introduced NIPER (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the Lok Sabha on 15th March, 2021. The provisions of the Bill include setting up a NIPER Council under the chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister (Chemicals & Fertilizers) to coordinate the activities of various NIPERs and ensure planned and coordinated development of pharmaceutical education and research and maintenance of standards thereof.  (b): NIPERs are autonomous institutions having their own Board of Governors, which are responsible for the general superintendence, direction and control of the affairs of the Institute. As the institutes are mainly funded by the Government, it periodically reviews their functioning. The annual accounts of the Institute are also audited by the office of CAG. A third-party evaluation of NIPERs through a private party has also been conducted. Further, the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) under the Ministry of Finance also appraise the functioning of NIPERs for their continuation/ expansion. Ministry of Education publishes annual National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking public and private Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in the country under various categories. The ranking of NIPERs under the “Pharmacy” category during last four years is as under:      NIPERs	2017	2018	2019	2020Mohali	2nd	1st	3rd	3rd Hyderabad	5th	6th	6th	5th Ahmedabad	-	14th	9th	8th Guwahati 	-	-	-	11th Raebareli 	-	-	-	18th Kolkata 	-	-	-	27th The institute-wise details of students passed out, research papers published, patents filed and MOUs signed are as under:  NIPER	Students passed out	Research Papers published	Patents filed	MoU signedMohali	3,735	2,777	198	23Ahmedabad	619	594	21	23Hyderabad	1113	786	32	52Guwahati	400	301	20	24Kolkata	479	204	02	23Raebareli	385	238	20	15Hajipur	333	134	03	10Total	7,064	5,034	296	178The institute-wise details of funds released to each NIPERs since their inception (upto June, 2021) are as under:NIPER	Funds released (Rs. in crore)Mohali	406.54Ahmedabad	195.77Hyderabad	310.45Guwahati	298.59Kolkata	117.37Raebareli	113.29Hajipur	80.55Total	1522.56(c): EFC proposal has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for setting up five new NIPERs in the states of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. (d): While, NIPER-Mohali already has sanctioned posts and regular faculty/ non-faculty posts, the Ministry of Finance approved 156 faculty and 190 non-faculty posts in the year 2019 for other six NIPERs, viz., Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Raebareli. After framing recruitment rules for various posts, the process for filling up the faculty/ non-faculty posts in these Institutes has been initiated and the same would be completed soon. The institute-wise status of sanctioned/ filled up posts are as under:  	Faculty	Non-Faculty	Sanctioned	Filled	Under process	Vacant	Sanctioned	Filled	Under process	VacantMohali	62	26	-	36	224	120	-	104Ahmedabad	33	23	-	10	37	17	-	20Hyderabad	33	23	-	10	37	16	-	21Guwahati	33	20	-	13	37	17	18	02Kolkata	19	12	04	03	27	13	05	09Hajipur	19	04	08	07	26	05	10	11Raebareli	19	16	-	03	27	06	15	06Total	21812412	8241519448173(e) and (f): While NIPER Mohali and NIPER Guwahati have own permanent campus, the construction of NIPER Ahmedabad has started in full swing. At present, NIPERs at Ahmedabad, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Raebareli are functioning from rented premises. A consolidated EFC proposal with an outlay of Rs. 4,300 crore for the period 2020-21 to 2024-25 has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for strengthening and equipping of the existing seven NIPERs and setting up of five new NIPERs.
