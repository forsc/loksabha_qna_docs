ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI) -2-L.S.US.Q. NO.420 FOR 20.07.2021(a):    There are reports about influx of Myanmar nationals into Indian Territory through India-Myanmar Border due to internal situation in Myanmar. (b):    Foreign nationals who enter into the country without valid travel documents are treated as illegal migrants. Since, such illegal migrants including refuge seekers from neighboring countries enter India in a clandestine and surreptitious manner without valid travel documents, accurate data regarding number of such persons sneaking into Indian territory through various borders is not available. (c):    Central Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to ensure effective surveillance and domination of international borders to check infiltration of illegal migrants.  Physical infrastructure like border fencing, floodlighting, construction of border roads and establishment of border outposts has been created.  Vulnerable border outposts are regularly reviewed and strengthened by deploying additional manpower, special surveillance equipments and other force multipliers. A technological solution in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management -3-L.S.US.Q. NO.420 FOR 20.07.2021System (CIBMS) has been implemented in some vulnerable border areas.  Border guarding forces conduct regular patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunnelling exercises to stop illegal infiltration. Central Government has issued advisory to Border Security Force and Assam Rifles to maintain strict vigilance and surveillance and to take all possible steps for preventing illegal infiltration at International Borders.(d):  Deportation of illegal migrants after nationality verification is a continuous process. The powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to deport illegal foreign nationals and powers under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to remove an illegal foreigner by force have been entrusted under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India to all the State Governments. Further, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, Administrators of all Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to the aforesaid powers. Central Government has issued instructions regarding identification of illegal migrants and their   deportation to all  States  &  UTs  from  time   to-4-L.S.US.Q. NO.420 FOR 20.07.2021time. Consolidated instructions in this regard have also been issued on 30.03.2021. (e):    As per information received from the State Government of Mizoram no such decision has been taken. *****
