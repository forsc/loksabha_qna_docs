( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR )(a)	& (b):     Soil Health Card Scheme was launched by Hon''ble PM in Feb, 2015 to assist States/UTs Governments to issue soil health cards to all farmers in the country. Soil health card provides information to farmers on nutrients status of their soils along with recommendation on appropriate dosages and type of fertilizers & manures to be applied to optimize yield and improving soil health that in turn reduces over use and under use of fertilizers, thus reducing the overall operation cost besides enhancing farmer’s income.                Since the inception of the scheme nearly 10.74 and 11.93 crore soil health cards (SHCs) were distributed during Cycle-I (2015-17) and Cycle- II (2017-19) respectively to the farmers across the country. During 2019-20 Model Village Programme was implemented in 6954 villages (1 village from each block) in the country for land holding based collection of soil samples whereas in the current year (2020-21) to boost the already ongoing awareness creation about the soil health cards amongst the farmer it is decided to conduct demonstrations and farmer trainings in nearly 98530 selected villages. States/UTs-wise progress of Soil Health Card Scheme and number of farmers benefitted through SHCs distribution, demonstrations and farmer trainings are given Annexure-I & II respectively.(c) & (d):   The scheme is proposed to be continued during next financial year with emphasis on awareness creation of farmers and motivating farmers towards regular soil testing and adoption of Integrated Nutrient Management based on soil testing recommendations.  The budget estimate for 2021-22 is Rs 324.43 Crore.
