ANSWER




(a) & (b) Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the National Crèche Scheme for the children of working mothers as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme through States/ UTs with effect from 01.01.2017 to provide day care facilities to children (age group of 6 months to 6 years) of working mothers.  The provision made and the expenditure incurred during last five years under the scheme are given below:- Year	BE (in Crore)	Expenditure (in Crore)2016-17	150.00	124.622017-18	200.00	 48.792018-19	128.39	 29.772019-20	  50.00	 47.772020-21	  75.00	 11.60 (c) & (d): Government is making appropriate allocation for the National Creche Scheme based on the expenditure incurred during the previous years. The release of funds depends on submission of utilization certificate and statement of expenditure against the funds released during the previous financial year as per the provisions of General Financial Rules. Ever since the out break of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions, the functioning of creches has been affected as the children were not able to attend creches. This is the primary reasons for lesser expenditure during the previous financial year.**
