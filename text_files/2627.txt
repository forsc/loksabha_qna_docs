                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b):	As per the information received from the Government of Uttarakhand at present there is neither shortage of diesel-petrol in Haridwar-Badrinath-Hemkund road, nor shortage of cash in Yatra route. Sufficient cash is available for ATM replenishment in the Yatra route branches. Earlier in the first week of June, due to pressure of huge number of pilgrims coming to Somwati Amavasya Snan and Eid holiday, Tankers got stuck in the traffic jam in the route, so shortage of petrol-diesel was experienced.State Government immediately took remedial actions. Extra tankers were sent to the petrol pumps along the Yatra route. Sufficient stock of petrol-diesel for 2-3 days was supplied to the petrol pumps. Oil depots were made working during all holidays in the month of June 2019. Everyday monitoring was done during that period and as a result within 2-3 days time normal supply of petrol-diesel got restored.(c) & (d):	Various facilities are being provided to the pilgrims coming for this year’s Chardham yatra. For making pilgrimage more comfortable helicopter service is available for Kedarnath,  Doli’s ponies are available in the trek routes of Kedarnath and Yamunotri Dham. Arrangement for sufficient number of buses, taxis medical relief posts, permanent & temporary toilets, drinking water facility etc have been made available at various locations of the Chardham yatra route. Photometric registration of the pilgrims coming for Chardham & Hemkund Yatra is being done at ten different places in the route.
