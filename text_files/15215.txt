(b): The Ministry has identified sub-districts in each State to select the Clusters as per pre-defined methodology as mentioned in Framework of Implementation (FOI) of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM), which factors in parameters such as (i) Decadal Growth in Rural Population (ii) Decadal Growth in Non-Farm work force participation (iii) Presence of Economic Clusters (iv) Presence of places of Tourism and Pilgrimage significance  (v) Proximity to Transport Corridors, (vi) Decadal growth in Tribal Population and (vii) Current Tribal Literacy Rate. The clusters are selected and approved by States/ UTs and sent to Ministry for final approval.  It is also mandated in the FOI of SPMRM that a ‘Rurban cluster’, would be a cluster of geographically contiguous villages with a population of about 25,000 to 50,000 in plain and coastal areas and with a population of 5,000 to 15,000 in desert, hilly or tribal areas.Accordingly, Andhra Pradesh has been allotted 13 SPMRM clusters out of the 300 clusters to be developed across the country under three phases of SPMRM. Rampachodavaram cluster in East Godavari district was selected by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh as Tribal cluster under Phase III of SPMRM. (c):  There is no proposal for setting up more clusters under the current Mission period as of now. (d):  Strengthening economic growth is one of the key priorities in cluster development.
