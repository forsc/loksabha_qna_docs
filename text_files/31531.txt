( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR )(a) to (d):	In order to promote efficient use of fertilizers, Government is implementing Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme since 2015 to provide soil test based fertilizer use recommendations to the farmers. Soil Health Card provides nutrient status of the soil along with prescription about balanced and integrated use of inorganic and organic fertilizers to maintain good soil health that results in increase in production. Demonstration about balanced use of fertilizers based on soil health card recommendations and training to the farmers on proper and integrated use of fertilizers are integral part of the scheme. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is suggesting soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, bio-fertilizer etc.) of plant nutrients to improve sol health and fertility. In addition, split application and placement of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers, growing leguminous crops and use of Resources Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also advocated.For creating awareness among farmers around 6.04 lakh demonstrations, 93781 farmer’s trainings and 7425 farmers melas are organized / conducted under Soil Health Card programme since 2015. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) also imparts training, organizes front line demonstrations to educate farmers on this aspect.********
