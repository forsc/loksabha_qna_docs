ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) and (b): Ministry of Railways (MoR) has formulated a Participative Policy, 2012 to encourage the investment in developing rail connectivity by associating strategic partners and other investors. The policy defines five Public Private Partnership models viz. Non-Government Railway (NGR), Joint Venture (JV), Customer Funded, Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and BOT-annuity models. State Governments/Local bodies/PSUs may also participate as stakeholder for the development of new lines/gauge conversion project under the participative policy of MoR. In all such Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects, train operation and revenue collection continues to remain with Railway. However, such entities get a share of revenue in lieu of owing/maintaining the infrastructure. The PPP mode has been found to be quite successful in Railways, especially in providing last mile rail connectivity to many ports and industrial clusters. Since the train operation & tariff determination continues to remain with Railways no additional burden on railway commuters are incurred. So far, 14 projects of ` 9,234 Crore have already been completed through PPP mode. 10 more projects of ` 19,417 Crore are under implementation including coal connectivity and port connectivity projects and in addition, 7 more projects of ` 13,971 Crore have already been granted In-Principle approval, which are under development stage. (c) to (e): The process of Modernization and introduction of new technologies are continuous process in Indian Railways. Adoption of modern technologies covers various facets of railway working, which primarily aimed at improving the operational efficiency and safety in Railway workings. The modern technology mainly  include introduction of higher horse power locomotives, modernisation of Signaling and telecommunication system, improving the  capacity of wagons and coaches, station development, introduction of increased use of IT-enabled services for improved customer interface,  new technologies in improving the life-cycle  and reliability of  railway assets. All possible funding mechanisms are explored for modernization of railway systems and introduction of new technologies, which are met through both from Budgetary and Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR).****
