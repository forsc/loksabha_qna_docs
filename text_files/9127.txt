ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	Every year, the U.S. Secretary of State prepares and submits to the U.S. Congress an annual report on international religious freedom, which contains the U.S. Government’s assessment of the state of religious freedom in every country, including India, drawing upon reports on incidents involving alleged violations of religious rights during the reporting year. We consider such activities an internal exercise of the U.S. Government. We believe that, no foreign entity or Government has any locus standi to pronounce on our citizens’ fundamental rights. India is a vibrant pluralistic society where the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect all fundamental rights. The Government is fully committed to the rights of Indian citizens enshrined in our Constitution and the laws.***
