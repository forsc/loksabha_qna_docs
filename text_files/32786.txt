THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) & (b):	FDI policy is an enabling policy which is uniformly applicable in the country. Government has put in place a liberal and transparent policy for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), wherein most of the sectors are open to FDI under the automatic route. There is no specific sector pertaining to ‘Textiles’ listed in Consolidated FDI Policy Circular 2020. However, as per para 5.2 (a) of FDI Policy, in sectors/activities not listed under the FDI Policy, FDI is permitted up to 100% on the automatic route, subject to applicable laws/regulations; security and other conditionalities.(c) & (d):	Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Textiles has been notified with a budgetary outlay of Rs 10683 crore to promote production of MMF Apparel, MMF Fabrics and 10 Segments/ Products of Technical Textiles in the country.
