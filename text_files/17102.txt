ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Government of India has notified a Greenfield Airport Policy in 2008 prescribing the Guidelines for setting up of new Greenfield airports in the Country. As per the Policy, no greenfield airport is generally allowed within an aerial distance of 150 Km of an existing civilian airport. However, in case a greenfield airport is proposed to be set up within 150 Km of an existing civilian airport, the impact on the existing airport is examined. Such cases are decided by the Government on a case to case basis. So far, Government has given approval for setting up of second airport in cities of Delhi (Jewar airport in Noida), Mumbai (Navi Mumbai Airport), Goa (Mopa airport) and Ahmedabad (Dholera airport). (c): Government of India has granted certain Rights against the second airport, to the airport operators of Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru airports under the respective Agreements signed with them. The State Support Agreement (SSA) for Delhi and Mumbai airports grants Right of First Refusal (RoFR) to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) in case a second airport is established in the City. Exercising the RoFR, both DIAL and MIAL have participated in the tender process of Jewar and Navi Mumbai projects respectively.Concession Agreements of Hyderabad and Bangalore airports grant exclusive rights to Hyderabad International Airport Limited (HIAL) and Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) respectively with a provision that no new or existing domestic/international airport shall be permitted by GoI within an aerial distance of 150 kilometres of the airport before the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Airport Opening Date (year 2008 for both the airports). However, under the Concession Agreement with BIAL, Mysore and Hassan airports have been exempted from the above exclusivity clause. (d): No, Sir. Currently, Government has no proposal to establish airport at Pollachi under UDAN scheme.
