ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	The Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Scheme was launched by Government of India in 2008. However, selection of candidates under INSPIRE Faculty sub-scheme was started from July 2011.  The total number of candidates enrolled in INSPIRE faculty scheme from July 2011 batch to July 2018 batch is 1244.(b)	The total number of INSPIRE Faculty awardees absorbed by the host institutes is 253 and those absorbed by institutions other than  host institutes is 296.(c) & (d):  The number of candidates who got absorbed is 44% of the total enrolment. In order to assist the INSPIRE Faculty awardees who are yet to find employment after completion of five years, the Department of Science and Technology (DST), through its autonomous body Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), has launched a “SERB  Research Scientist Scheme” for sustainment of their research career for an additional period of two years and extendable by one more year. Such candidates can apply for this scheme once. The selection of SERB Research Scientists is highly competitive and candidates are selected based on their research performance during the tenure of INSPIRE Faculty award and their plans for further research.                                           ********
