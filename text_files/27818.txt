ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHOUDHARY)(a) & (b) Sir, The Goods and Services Tax [GST] mechanism does not pertain to claims of drawback. However, GST mechanism for claim of refund by Exporters is a streamlined process. Cases have been booked where Exporters have claimed refund of GST on the basis of fraudulent documents. The details are as under: Year	No. of cases booked for fraudulent refunds	Quantum of ITC refund fraud detected (In Rs. Cr.)2017-18 [w.e.f. July-2017]	56	72.992018-19	18	37.932019-20	171	799.782020-21	111	434.932021-22 [Upto June-2021]	13	313.55 	 Though, the interface for the taxpayers is on digital and software. However, tax evaders are known to commit fraud even on electronic platforms by way of mis-representation of facts like furnishing of fake credentials at the time of registration; by indulging in raising fake invoice to avail undue Input Tax Credit, etc. To prevent tax-evasion, various validations have been built in GSTIN/ CBIC system to weed out tax evaders.(c) & (d) Most of the issues reported by tax payers pertain to non-availability or technical issues of certain functionalities or forms. Certain key functionalities like user profile, dashboard, filing of ITR 1,2 & 4, e-proceedings including Video conferencing requests, Digital Signing Certificate, viewing of old Income Tax returns, e-verification, e-PAN service, Aadhaar-PAN Linking, Adding Authorised Representative, etc. are available to the users(e) The Income Tax Department is continuously engaged with Infosys to expedite the resolution of any pending issues. The Department has taken corrective measures through Infosys based on feedback from taxpayers, tax professionals and representatives of ICAI. Infosys has informed that technical issues noticed in the functioning of the portal are continuously being resolved.*****
