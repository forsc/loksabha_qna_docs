However, consultations were held with all stake holders including officers and staff federations/associations representing Group A, B and C cadres.(d) and (e)	Yes Sir. The shift in indirect tax administration and its business processes due to introduction of GST has been taken into consideration while formulating the Cadre Restructuring proposal.
