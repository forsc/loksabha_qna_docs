ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has granted permission only to Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) on 28.07.2015 for carrying out audience rating measurement. BARC is a self-regulatory, industry-led body created by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF), the Indian Society for Advertisers (ISA) and the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI). BARC operates through its Technical Committee, Oversight Committee, Disciplinary Council and Board of Directors. It measures and publishes TV viewership estimates based on an elaborate process and currently reports on the viewership of more than 550+ channels for the estimated 210 million TV homes in India.  (b) and (c): Yes Sir.  There have been inputs on anomalous viewership behavior in the audience measurement ratings. The “Guidelines for Television Rating Agencies in India” notified by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16th January, 2014 already have provisions like methodology for audience measurement, panel selection, viewing platform, secrecy and privacy, data analysis, transparency etc. which are essential for a transparent and accountable rating system in India.Further, in order to address the issues in the light of fresh recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the technological advancements / interventions to address the system, a Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Officer, Prasar Bharati with members from IIT, C-DOT and IIM.   Based on the recommendations of the Committee headed by CEO, Prasar Bharati along with recommendations of TRAI, the present guidelines have been analysed / evaluated vis-à-vis strengthening of transparency / panel homes and other parameters.*****
