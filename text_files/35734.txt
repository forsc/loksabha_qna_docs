ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) and (b): "Police" and "Public order" are state subjects as per the Seventh Schedule  to  the  Constitution of India.  Maintaining  law and order, protection of life and property of citizens are the responsibility of the respective States/ Union Territories and they are competent to deal with all matters relating to these subjects under the extant provisions of laws, including setting up of all women police stations. Information on steps taken by the States/ UTs in this regard are not maintained centrally.(c) and (d): The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 is applicable on all work places, including police stations. The responsibility of implementation of the said Act at State and District levels rests with the appropriate Government, i.e. the respective States/ Union Territories. Details are not maintained centrally.The Central Armed Police Forces are fully compliant in the implementation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. (e): 	While States/ Union Territories implement police reforms measures, including improvement of gender balance in police, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued advisories to the States/UTs to strengthen welfare measures such as provisioning of housing and medical facilities and other necessary facilities for women police personnel in Police stations. As per available information, several States/Union Territories have set up Police Women Commando Units breaking the gender barrier. Similarly, in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), women representation has increased. In order to attract talented women from all parts and segments of the country to join the forces, application fee is exempted for women candidates in recruitment. Creches/ Day-Care centres have been provided in CAPFs. Same opportunities are being made available to the women officers of CAPFs, e.g. in the Central Industrial Security Forces women officers play a critical role in guarding vital installations like airports and government infrastructure and women personnel have been inducted into the specialised jungle warfare commando force by the Central Reserve Police Forces.***
