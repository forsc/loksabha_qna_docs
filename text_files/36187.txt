                                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                       MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b): No Sir. The number of slums has reduced from 51,688 to 33,510 as per 58th and 69th round Survey of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) on urban slums in 2002 and 2012 respectively. The State wise total number of slums as per NSSO surveys is at Annexure.(c): Land and colonization are State subjects. The schemes related to housing including rehabilitation of slum dwellers are implemented by Sates/ Union Territories (UTs). However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is supplementing the efforts of State/ UT by providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries including slum dwellers. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through  available  four verticals  i.e. Beneficiary-led Construction  (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). ISSR component of the Scheme specifically deals with slum redevelopment using land as a resource. Central assistance of ? 1 lakh per house is provided under this component, based on projects submitted by the State/ UT Governments. Under ISSR component, a total of 4,51,050 houses have been sanctioned so far to construct houses for slum dwellers.(d) & (e): Public health and sanitation are State subjects.  The primary responsibility of strengthening public health and sanitation in all urban areas including slums lies with the respective State/UT Governments. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of States/UTs through various programmatic interventions including Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM), National Health Mission (NHM) for augmenting and improving the sanitation and public health facilities for urban poor in the country including slum areas.                               *****
