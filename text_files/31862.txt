ANSWER




(a) to (c).  The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing ‘Ujjawala’ scheme which is a comprehensive scheme for prevention of trafficking and rescue, rehabilitation, reintegration and repatriation of victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The objectives of the scheme inter alia include (i) providing rehabilitation services, both immediate and long-term, to the victims by providing basic amenities/needs such as shelter, food, clothing, medical treatment including counseling, legal aid and guidance and vocational training, and (ii) facilitating reintegration of the victims into the family and society at large. Under ‘Rehabilitation’ component of the scheme, grant is provided for setting up of Ujjawala Homes on rent, staff, food, medical care, legal aid, education and vocational training. Under ‘Reintegration’ component, grant is provided for setting up half-way homes, seed money and follow-up visits. A half-way home is a home within the community, where a group of victims, ready for reintegration, live and work out of. This is to facilitate smooth transition from life in a shelter home to an independent living in the community. A half-way home is for a group of victims who are gainfully employed and can live semi-independently with minimum supervision. This is a phased approach to re-integration into the community. Under the Scheme, arrangements are made by the implementing organization for providing vocational training to the women through the Vocational Training Institutes recognized by Directorate General of Employment and Training under the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Training and examination fees are reimbursed on submission of the certificate issued by the vocational training institute on successful completion of training.Evaluation of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Ministry, including Ujjawala, was done by NITI Aayog in 2020 and it was recommended inter alia to integrate it with the Swadhar Greh Scheme, to increase its coverage and enhance the use of information technology in implementation of the scheme.(d).  State/UT-wise details of rehabilitation of rescued victims during the last three years (2018-2020) is at Annexure. (e) & (f).  The State Governments/Union Territories(UTs) have notified their victim compensation schemes in terms of Section 357A of the Code for Criminal Procedure(Cr.PC). Further, in order to support and supplement the State Compensation Schemes,  Ministry of Home Affairs had released Rs 200 crores as a one-time grant to State Governments/ UTs under the Central Victim Compensation Fund from Nirbhaya Fund. States/ UTs use the fund to compensate victims of various crimes, including human traffickingUnder Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training in the country. ******   															Annexure-IState/UT-wise Rehabilitation of Rescued Victims during 2018-2020SL 	State/UT	2018	2019	2020		Sent Back to Parents	Sent to Shelter Homes	Handed Over to NGOs	Other Rehabili-tation 	Total	Sent Back to Parents	Sent to Shelter Homes	Handed Over to NGOs	Other Rehabili-tation 	Total	Sent Back to Parents	Sent to Shelter Homes	Handed Over to NGOs	Other Rehabili-tation 	Total1	Andhra Pradesh	64	134	0	255	453	208	179	38	0	425	106	81	70	0	2572	Arunachal Pradesh	1	0	2	1	4	3	0	0	0	3	13	0	0	0	133	Assam 	280	10	0	5	295	230	0	0	0	230	142	3	12	0	1574	Bihar	312	57	206	47	622	46	223	17	30	316	92	82	4	1	1795	Chhattisgarh	275	0	0	0	275	331	6	0	0	337	96	0	0	0	966	Goa	13	43	0	46	102	2	83	0	5	90	0	30	0	0	307	Gujarat	20	0	1	5	26	8	1	4	5	18	42	43	0	2	878	Haryana	30	0	0	0	30	10	0	0	10	20	11	0	0	7	189	Himachal Pradesh	11	0	0	0	11	9	3	2	2	16	13	0	0	0	1310	Jharkhand 	216	28	0	8	252	118	18	8	19	163	265	0	13	0	27811	Karnataka	182	16	3	0	201	167	14	0	5	186	10	13	0	16	3912	Kerala	136	21	0	1	158	208	7	0	0	215	191	5	0	0	19613	Madhya Pradesh	74	9	14	3	100	193	21	1	2	217	103	7	1	2	11314	Maharashtra	111	523	61	96	791	221	234	2	563	1020	127	330	10	90	55715	Manipur	4	1	0	0	5	69	34	72	13	188	4	0	0	5	916	Meghalaya	7	0	0	0	7	19	10	0	0	29	2	0	0	0	217	Mizoram	3	0	0	0	3	1	0	53	0	54	0	0	0	0	018	Nagaland	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	18	0	20	0	0	0	0	019	Odisha	252	0	0	0	252	876	0	0	0	876	748	6	0	10	76420	Punjab	20	1	0	1	22	26	0	0	1	27	65	0	15	1	8121	Rajasthan	27	26	264	62	379	12	599	53	0	664	77	737	4	0	81822	Sikkim	4	0	0	0	4	2	0	0	0	2	4	0	0	0	423	Tamil Nadu	54	11	0	0	65	15	1	58	2	76	21	2	12	1	3624	Telangana	21	406	8	72	507	27	233	0	74	334	87	333	0	18	43825	Tripura	1	0	0	1	2	3	0	0	0	3	2	0	0	0	226	Uttar Pradesh	59	0	27	0	86	100	33	4	0	137	54	95	6	19	17427	Uttarakhand	47	3	8	0	58	32	4	0	0	36	12	0	1	0	1328	West Bengal 	226	24	1	3	254	61	23	3	7	94	62	5	0	8	75 	TOTAL STATE(S)	2450	1313	595	606	4964	2998	1727	333	738	5796	2349	1772	148	180	444929	A & N Islands	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	030	Chandigarh	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	2	3	0	0	0	331	D&N Haveli and Daman & Diu +	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	232	Delhi UT	101	288	25	8	422	419	45	142	2	608	174	35	15	0	22433	Jammu & Kashmir *	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	234	ladakh	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	0	0	0	0	035	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	036	Puducherry	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0 	TOTAL UT(S)	101	289	25	8	423	419	51	142	3	615	179	37	15	0	231 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	2551	1602	620	614	5387	3417	1778	475	741	6411	2528	1809	163	180	4680Source : Human Trafficking Data published is based on Annual data provided by State/UT from their Anti-Human Trafficking Units 					Note : 	''+'' Combined data of erstwhile D&N Haveli UT and Daman & Diu UT for the year 2018-2019										*'' Data of erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir State including Ladakh for the year 2018-2019
