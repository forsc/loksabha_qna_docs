                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (c)   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.  *153 TO BE ANSWERED ON 29.07.2021 ON “GROUND WATER POLLUTION IN JHARKHAND” RAISED BY DR. NISHIKANT DUBEY.(a)  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality-monitoring program and various scientific studies. These studies indicate the occurrence of contaminants such as fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, iron and heavy metals beyond permissible limits (as per norms of Bureau of Indian Standards) for human consumption in isolated pockets in various States / UTs. State-wise details of contamination of ground water in the country including in rural areas is given at Annexure-I.In Santhal Pargana division, fluoride and nitrate concentration beyond permissible limit in the groundwater has been observed in Godda, Pakur and Sahibganj districts. Arsenic concentration beyond permissible limit (in groundwater) has been observed in Sahibganj district and iron concentration beyond permissible limit (in groundwater) has been observed in Deoghar district of Jharkhand.Further, the Groundwater aquifer contamination can be linked to geo-genic and anthropogenic sources. It is difficult to treat the aquifer water contamination due to geo-genic sources, however, a number of initiatives have been taken to reduce the groundwater contamination owing to anthropogenic sources. In addition, because of easy availability and low cost system various Governments have generally concentrated on making available the groundwater for drinking purposes after suitable treatment.Central government in collaboration with States/UTs has identified rural habitations with contaminated water sources. As per information available with the Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation (DoDW&S) and as reported by States/ UTs (as on 23.07.2021), 47,873 rural habitations including 248 habitations of Jharkhand have been reported to have quality issues in drinking water sources. State-wise details in this regard are given at Annexure–II. District-wise details of habitations reported to have quality issues in drinking water sources in Jharkhand including in certain districts of Santhal Pargana division are given at Annexure-III.(b) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management, including its quality is primarily the responsibility of State Government.  However, various steps have been taken by the Central Government for facilitating ground water quality improvement/ remediation of contamination in the drinking water in the country.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to prevent and control pollution in water.  CPCB has made a comprehensive programme on water pollution for controlling point sources  by  developing industry specific standards and general standards for discharge of effluents notified Contd…P/2//2//under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for enforcement by SPCBs/PCCs.  As per the directives of CPCB, Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) are installed by the industrial units in the country for getting real time information on the effluent quality and non-complying units are identified for follow-up inspections and actions.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) in 2019, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of  256  districts  in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. In addition ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan – Catch the Rain’ campaign has been launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India on 22 March 2021. The improved groundwater recharge due to construction of artificial recharge structures and increased water harvesting is likely to significantly contribute towards reducing the contaminants level in the aquifer waters.The groundwater pollution owe its origin to contamination of surface water sources also which upon percolation pollute the groundwater aquifer system and therefore, various efforts have been made in the country to address this by installing Sewage Treatment Plants, Effluent Treatment Plants and better system of sewage networks etc. However, the adverse effects of the groundwater pollution can be addressed to a large extent if safe water is made available to public. With this aim, central Government in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August, 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024. Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to house-holds, priority is given to quality-affected habitations. While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including arsenic and fluoride, as on 31st March of the preceding Financial Year. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source may take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DoDW&S) had launched a National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) on 22nd March, 2017 as a part of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under Jal Jeevan Mission, to provide safe drinking water to 27,544 arsenic/fluoride affected rural habitations in the country. Rs 4,160.34 crore has been released as central assistance to arsenic/fluoride affected States under NWQSM out of which total expenditure as on 23.07.2021 is Rs 3,330.65 crore.Contd…P/2//2//DoDW&S is assisting and facilitating States/UTs in setting up, strengthening, up-gradation, improving the functioning of drinking water quality testing laboratories by providing policy guidelines, technical and financial support under JJM. States/UTs are maintaining a network of 2,015 water quality testing laboratories. State -wise details of drinking water quality testing laboratories are given at Annexure-IV.Under the National Aquifer Mapping Programme (NAQUIM) of CGWB, special attention is being given to the aspect of ground water quality including contamination by toxic substances such as arsenic in ground water. CGWB has constructed several exploratory and observation wells in the country tapping the arsenic safe deeper aquifer zones delineated through exploration aided detailed aquifer mapping under National Aquifer Mapping programme.  Successful wells have been handed over to the State Governments for their utilization. Further, CGWB is providing technical assistance to the States by sharing the cement sealing technology for tapping contamination free aquifers in Gangetic flood plains.The Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has issued guidelines for control and regulation of groundwater extraction with pan-India applicability notified on 24 September 2020.  The guidelines include suitable provisions on measures to be adopted to ensure groundwater free from pollution. Fifteenth Finance Commission in their report has recognized the country’s achievements on sanitation front and has recommended 30 % of the total grants to be disbursed to rural bodies shall be earmarked for drinking water, rainwater harvesting and water recycling. Further, 30 per cent of the total grants to be disbursed to rural local bodies shall be earmarked for sanitation and maintenance of Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, and this may include management and treatment of household waste, and human excreta and faecal sludge management in particular.(c) As explained earlier most of the initiatives of the Government were towards providing adequate drinking water to the public free from contaminants. In this regard, under JJM in the last three years Rs 29761.19 Crores have been released as Central share to States/UTs out of which Rs 21824.97 Cr have been utilized. Further, Rs 14014.87 Crores have been reported to be utilized by States/UTs in the last three years against State share. The details of funds allocated, released and expenditure/utilization under JJM in the last three years are given at Annexures V, VI & VII. ***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Starred Question No.*153 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 29.07.2021 regarding “Ground Water Pollution in Jharkhand”.States Wise Number of Partly Affected Districts with different Contaminants in Ground Water of IndiaS.No.	State/ UT	Salinity (EC above 3000 micro mhos/ cm)(EC: Electrical Conductivity)	Fluoride(above 1.5 mg/l)	Nitrate(above 45 mg/l)	Arsenic(above 0.01 mg/l)	Iron(above 1mg/l)	Lead (above 0.01 mg/l)	Cadmium (above 0.003 mg/l)	Chromium (above 0.05 mg/l)1	Andhra Pradesh	12	12	13	3	7			2	Telangana	8	10	10	1	8	2	1	13	Assam		9		19	18			4	Arunachal Pradesh					4			5	Bihar		13	10	22	19			6	Chhattisgarh	1	19	12	1	17	1	1	17	Delhi	7	7	8	2		3	1	48	Goa					2			9	Gujarat	21	22	24	12	10			10	Haryana 	18	21	21	15	17	17	7	111	Himachal Pradesh			6	1				12	Jammu & Kashmir		2	6	3	9	3	1	13	Jharkhand		12	11	2	6	1		14	Karnataka	29	30	29	2	22			15	Kerala	4	5	11		14	2		116	Madhya Pradesh	18	43	51	8	41	16		17	Maharashtra	25	17	30		20	19		18	Manipur		1		2	4			19	Meghalaya		1			6			20	Nagaland		1			1			21	Odisha	17	26	28	1	30			122	Punjab	10	19	21	10	9	6	8	1023	Rajasthan	30	33	33	1	33	3		24	Tamil Nadu	28	25	29	9	2	3	1	525	Tripura					4			26	Uttar Pradesh	13	34	59	28	15	10	2	327	Uttarakhand			4		5			28	West Bengal	6	8	5	9	16	6	2	229	Andaman& Nicobar	1				2			30	Daman & Diu	1		1	1				31	Puducherry			1						Total	Parts of 249 districts in 18 states & UTs	Parts of 370districts in 23 states & UTs	Parts of 423districts in 23states & UTs	Parts of 152 districts in 21 states & UTs	Parts of 341 districts in 27 states & UTs	Pb in parts of 92 districts in 14 states	Cd in parts of 24 districts in 9 states	Cr in parts of 29districts in 10 statesANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Starred Question No. *153 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 29.07.2021 regarding “Ground Water Pollution in Jharkhand”.
