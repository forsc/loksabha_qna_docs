ANSWER




(a)		No such official report is available with the Ministry.There is a non-official global forum namely International Ranger Federation which publishes Roll of Honour every year enlisting deaths of Rangers naturally or otherwise. This report has not been authenticated/verified by the Government.(b)		As reported by States and Union Territories, number of forest officials who lost their lives in previous years is given in Annexure 1. (c) 	Yes sir. The frontline forest officers and staff fearlessly protect our forest and wildlife and fight with wildlife poachers, timber smugglers and encroachers. It is true that in this commendable effort to protect our forest and wild life they have laid down their lives. Their martyrdom and efforts have been acknowledged for the first time at the national level and 25 forest staff have been given the certificate of recognition posthumously on the Forest Martyrs Day on 11 September 2020.(d) As per information received from the States and Union Territories (UTs),the State/UT of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal have provided arms to different levels of frontline staff including Forest Guards and Forest Rangers Officers. In the State of Manipur, procurement of arms is under process.(e) & (f) In the order by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in I.A. No. 941/2021 and Interlocutory Application Nos. 94310, 94313 and 94317/2020 dated 08.01.2021, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has directed the Home Secretary of the respective States/Union Territories to submit report within a period of four weeks on the prayers made in the Interlocutory Application. *****
