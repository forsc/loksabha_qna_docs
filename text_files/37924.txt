Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. Proposal for opening of new KV at Merta, District Nagaur has been found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites as per norms of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). Accordingly, the proposal has been considered by the “Challenge Method” Committee. Proposals for opening of new KVs at Parbatsar, Didwana and Kheenvsar in Nagaur district have been received by KVS. There are some discrepancies / deficiencies in the proposal which have been brought to the notice of district Administration, Nagaur by KVS for necessary rectification.  ******
