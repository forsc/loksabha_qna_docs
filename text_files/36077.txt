ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	The NFSA provides for coverage upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population which at Census 2011 comes to 81.35 crore.  Coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit. Further, against the intended coverage of 81.35 crore, the States/UTs have identified only 79.72 crore person. Still, there is a scope of identification of 1.63 crore more beneficiaries under the NFSA......2/--2-States/ Union Territories have also been advised to clean up their beneficiary database from time to time to ensure rightful targeting of beneficiaries and inclusion of deserving persons within the ceiling determined under the NFSA for availing benefits under the Act.(c) & (d): 	Section 9 of the Act provides that the total number of persons to be covered in rural and urban areas of the State shall be calculated on the basis of the population estimates as per the Census of which the relevant figures have been published. Therefore, any revision in coverage shall be possible only after the relevant data of next population Census is published.(e): 	Government undertook timely and concrete measures to ensure that there are no long term effects of the Covid-19 crisis on food security and nutrition in the country. To fulfill this objective, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) was launched to ensure that the targeted beneficiaries do not face any issue of food security on account of the pandemic.            PMGKAY provided for additional allocation of foodgrains @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for all the beneficiaries covered under Targeted Public Distribution System (Antyodaya Anna Yojana & Priority Households). This was over and above the monthly benefit provided under the National Food Security Act, 2013 to about 80 crore persons. The scheme was for the period April to November, 2020 and May to November, 2021. The scheme has now been extended till March, 2022.*****
