Therefore, we are unable to take decision in the present Petition.”As regards Petition No. 23/MP/2019, the CERC directed the petitioner to submit additional information on affidavit.Central Govt. has asked CTU to expedite the compliance of CERC Regulations.(c) :     Inter-State transmission schemes associated with RE projects under Phase-I have already been agreed in Regional Standing Committee on Transmission of Western, Northern and Southern Regions, National Committee on Transmission (NCT) and Empowered Committee on Transmission (ECT) in January, 2019. The process of bidding for transmission system associated with 12.4 GW of RE project is already underway and the same is expected to be completed by September, 2019.(d) :	 	The transmission system related to above RE projects, getting implemented through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Route, is being bid out with scheduled date of completion of most of the elements by December’ 2020.(e) :   		To expedite the implementation of Inter-State transmission schemes for evacuation of RE power, the bidding process and the process for grant of Regulatory Approval are being done simultaneously.
