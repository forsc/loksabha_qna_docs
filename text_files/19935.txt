                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN PARTS (a) to (e) IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 108 FOR ANSWER ON 09.02.2021 REGARDING FUNDS ALLOCATED TO BIHAR FOR RURAL AREAS (a) (b) & (e):  The Department of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhayay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Shyama Prasad  MukherjI Rurban Mission (SPMRM) and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) at panchayat level including Bihar to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, infrastructure development, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities.  Details of scheme-wise funds allocated/released by the Union Government to the State Government of Bihar including Maharajganj, Siwan and Saran Districts during the last three years are at Annexure.  However, both DDU-GKY and RSETI Schemes are demand driven schemes and funds are allocated to States as per demands against approved Action Plans. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is also a demand driven scheme and no separate allocation to the State is made. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds. Under SPMRM, funds are being released to the States/ UTs based on fulfillment of certain conditions mentioned in the Mission guidelines.          Moreover, under the Fourteenth Finance Commission awards, grants to the tune of Rs.15194.43 crore has been released to the State during the last three years on recommendations of the Ministry of Panhchayati Raj, out of which Rs.13504.80 crore has been utilized for the basic services namely water supply, sanitation, sewerage, solid waste management, storm water drainage, maintenance of community assets, roads, footpath, street lighting, burial and cremation grounds etc. This includes grants Rs.93.58 crore that was allocated and utilised for the Districts of Siwan and Saran as informed by the Government of Bihar.    (c) & (d):  The Ministry of Rural Development accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, National Level Monitors (NLMs), Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies. NLMs are deputed to visit the districts periodically, generally twice a year, to monitor and report on various aspects of implementation of all rural development programmes. The Department allows for registering complaint through various forums viz. CPGRAMS, complaints through State/UT helplines, written complaints etc. The complaints received in the Department are forwarded to the concerned State Governments /Union Territory for taking appropriate action including investigation.  State Governments are responsible to dispose of all irregularities reported in a time bound manner.  Social Audits are also conducted by some Schemes like Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, PMAY-G.  Third-Party evaluation of the Schemes is also carried out regularly and actions, as appropriate, are taken on the findings.         Moreover, for the proper utilization of the finance commission grants, as a part of the critical reform agenda and with a view to ensure timely and online availability of the audited accounts of the Panchayats, the Ministry of Panchyati Raj has launched the application of AuditOnline for strengthening the financial management and transparency of the Panchayats. The states have been on-boarded on this application and are in various stages of conduct of audit using this application.*****
