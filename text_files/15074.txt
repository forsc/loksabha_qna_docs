                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (f) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *337 ANSWERED ON 17.03.2020 REGARDING WOMEN REPRESENTATIVES IN PRIs. (a) A statement showing the percentage of elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the country, State/Union Territory-wise is given at Annexure I. (b) The details of Elected Representatives, Panchayat Functionaries and other stakeholders of panchayats trained across States/Union Territories during last three years are given in Annexure-II. The details of funds released and utilized during last three years, State/Union Territory-wise are given at Annexure-III.  (c) & (d) Panchayat, being “Local Government”, is a State subject and part of State list of Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India. Mandate for setting up of Panchayats is provided by Article 243 in Part IX of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the Panchayats are setup and operated through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. However, Ministry of Panchayati Raj has been supplementing the efforts of States/Union Territories for strengthening of PRIs by way of capacity building of Elected Representatives and Panchayat Functionaries to improve their functioning and effectiveness and make them self-reliant. Under the Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, Ministry provides financial support to States/Union Territories for Training Needs Assessment, evaluation of capacity building and training activities. Further, States/Union Territories have been advised to take up activities such as consultation with Elected Representatives, Panchayat Functionaries and other stakeholders, assessment of trainer, impact assessment of training programmes etc. before preparation of Capacity Building and Training plan under the Annual Action Plan for seeking financial support under the Scheme from Ministry. (e) A nationwide study on Elected Women Representatives in Panchayats commissioned by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj was published in year 2008. The study assessed the empowerment of Elected Women Representatives in various aspects including enhancement of the self-esteem, confidence and their decision making abilities. The study indicated that the participation of women in Gram Sabhas has increased, and attention was being given to women related issues such as drinking water, sanitation and child–sex ratio. The study reported that Elected Women Representatives have made efforts to encourage girls’ enrolment in schools and mitigate domestic violence.  (f) Article 243D of the Constitution ensures participation of women in PRIs by mandating not less than one-third reservation for women out of total number of seats to be filled by direct election and number of offices of chairpersons of Panchayats. As per the information available with the Ministry, 20 States such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West Bengal,  have made provisions of 50% reservation for women in PRIs in their respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. Government has been encouraging increased involvement of women in the functioning of Panchayats through active participation in the Gram Sabha meetings for preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans and various schemes being implemented by the Panchayats. This Ministry has also issued advisories to the States to facilitate holding of separate Ward Sabha and Mahila Sabha meetings prior to Gram Sabha meetings, enhancing the presence and participation of women in Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings, allocation of Panchayat funds for women centric activities, combating the evil of women trafficking, female foeticide, child marriage etc.***
