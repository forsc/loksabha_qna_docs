ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Responsibility of providing land for setting up institutions lies with the StateGovernments. The long pending land issues have been taken up with respectiveStates.However, under the Centrally Sponsored scheme of Rashtriya UchchatarShiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) based on theirfelt needs submit proposals to the Ministry seeking central assistance under variouscomponents such as New Model Degree Colleges, New Professional Colleges etc.Central assistance under RUSA is provided for Government and Government-aidedinstitutions coming under purview of State Governments/UT Administrations. Since,under RUSA, approvals are given only for central support on the proposals ofState/UT, the issue of giving or withdrawing approvals for creation of new institutionsdoes not arise as this matter comes under the purview of the State Government/UTAdministration.****
