ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *432 FOR ANSWER ON 01.04.2022 ASKED BY SHRI  RAMSHIROMANI VERMA REGARDING ‘PREVENTION OF CRIME AGAINST WOMEN’ (a) to (d) : The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publishes the data on crime against women which is available for the year upto 2020. The data published by NCRB shows a declining trend in the crime against women which was 3,71,503 in the year 2020, as against 4,05,326 in the year 2019.  As per the 2020 report of NCRB, majority of the indicators related to marital and natal violence such as dowry death (S. 304B Indian Penal Code or IPC), cruelty by husband or his relatives (S. 498 IPC), dowry harassment (the Dowry Prohibition Act), domestic violence (the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act) suggest declining trend as indicated in the following table: Marital Offences	2019	2020Cruelty by Husband or his Relatives (S. 498A)	1,24,934	1,11,549Dowry Harassment (under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961)	13,307	10,366Dowry Death (S. 304B IPC)	7,141	6,966Domestic Violence (under The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005)	553	446In respect of Uttar Pradesh, the reported data of Crime Against Women in 2019 and 2020 are 59853 and 49385 respectively, which shows a sharp decline over previous year. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women rests primarily with the respective State Governments. The Constitution of India guarantees the right to equality and also provides for positive interventions by the State to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and to ensure their holistic empowerment. Keeping in mind the vision articulated in various Constitutional provisions, the Central Government gives highest priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard. These include legislations such as ''The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018'', ''The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013'', ''The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005'', ''The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961'', and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, etc.The schemes/ projects implemented by the Central Government include One Stop Centres (OSCs); Universalisation of Women Helplines (WHL), Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) which is a pan-India single number (112)/ mobile app based system for emergencies; a cyber-crime reporting portal to report obscene content; Safe City Projects in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai) including infrastructure, technology adoption and capacity building in community through awareness programmes, training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers; distribution of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to States/ UTs; establishment of State of Art DNA Laboratory at CFSL, Chandigarh; assistance to 24 States/ UTs to strengthen Forensic Science Laboratories; setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including exclusive POCSO (e-POCSO) Courts for speedy disposal of cases of rape and cases under POCSO Act; setting up/ strengthening of Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in all districts of the country; setting up/ strengthening of Women Help Desks (WHDs) at Police Stations etc. The Government has also put in place Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences, an online analytic tool for tracking and monitoring of investigation. A National Database of Sexual Offenders (NDSO) has also been created.  Under Nirbhaya Fund, Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) has also undertaken several initiatives, which, inter-alia includes training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers, distribution of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to States/ UTs.  BPR&D has also prepared Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for ‘Women Help Desk at Police Stations’ to ensure smooth functioning of Women Help Desks by focusing on four critical components, viz. infrastructure, training, human resource development and response mechanism.  A book titled ‘Women’s Safety and Security - a Handbook for First Responders and Investigators in the Police’ has also been prepared for the purpose of prevention and investigation of crime against women with specific reference to the crime of sexual assault, which includes investigation, victim compensation and rehabilitation.  Emphasis has been laid upon appropriate behavioural and attitudinal skills of the police in course of prevention and detection of crime against women and children and interaction with victims of crime.  Webinars on women safety with sensitivity, gender sensitization of police personnel etc. have also been organized by BPR&D.    Ministry of Women and Child Development is collaborating with National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) for providing  basic and advanced training under the project named ‘Stree Manoraksha’ to the staff of OSCs across the country on  handling psycho-social and mental health care needs to support the women facing violence and women in distress. Further, the National Commission for Women (NCW), in addition to handling complaints through regular mode, helps women in distress through a dedicated WhatsApp Number at 72177 35372 for reporting domestic violence cases. NCW also takes cognizance of the grievances relating to domestic violence reported in social media. The complaints received by NCW are acted upon by coordinating with victims, police and other authorities to provide immediate assistance.Further, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/ UT Administrations to make the police force efficient and capable, and its functioning more effective, transparent and accountable. However, the Government has taken several steps on Police reforms, from time to time. In order to facilitate police in States/ UTs with a common IT platform for filing reports, investigation, collecting and sharing information on crimes and criminals at national level, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has implemented Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) in all police stations. CCTNS has been integrated through Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) to facilitate use of information on crime and criminals in CCTNS with other databases on prisons, prosecution, forensics and courts in a holistic manner for administration of criminal justice. In addition, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States/ UTs from time to time on various issues pertaining to safety and security of women and children including advisories to bring in the requisite reforms in the Police. *****
