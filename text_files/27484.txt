ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d): Ministry vide its notification dated 31.03.2021 (Annexure-I) had extended the timeline for compliance of revised standards of 2015 for coal based power plants.  As per information submitted by utilities to Central Electricity authority (CEA) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), out of 442 units, 355 units are complying with PM norms, 256 units are complying with NOx norm and 68 units are complying with SO2 emission norms.   The Ministry had notified emission norms on 07.12.2015 for parameters viz. Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Mercury (Hg) and revised the norms for Particulate Matter emission for coal/lignite based Thermal Power Plants (TPPs), which were to be implemented within two years from the notification i.e. 07.12.2017. Subsequently in December 2017 after taking consideration of following factors the timeline was extended on case to case basis from year 2018 to 2022: i.	Technical challenges such as supply and demand assessment done by CEA; ii.	The plan with timelines for phasing was prepared and submitted before Hon''ble Supreme Court, considering supply and demand aspect;iii.	Market supply condition as limited technology providers are available;iv.	Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 29.07.2020 in W.P. (C) 13029 of 1985 has seized the matter on certain emission norms.  The implementation of the emission norms was further affected by the disruptions caused by covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, it was decided to grant extension of timeline for implementation of emission norms by TPPs and amendment notification was published on 31.03.2021. The rationale of timelines was based on environment considerations. (e) and (f)Ministry has not done any assessment of impact on environment and health of people due to continued operation of TPPs without complying to revised standards. The thermal power plants have taken measures for compliance of revised norms and the progress are at various stages of completion.*****
