ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) Plastic waste, if not managed in an environmentally sound manner, may have a serious environmental impact. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducted a study in 60 major cities of India and estimated that around 4059 T/day of plastic waste is generated from these cities. Extrapolating this plastic waste generation data from these cities to the entire country, it is estimated that around 25,940 T/day of plastic waste is generated in India. Approximately 15,384 tonnes per day, which is 60% of the total plastic waste generation, is collected and recycled. The rest remains uncollected and littered.(b) In order to ensure environmentally sound management of plastic waste and to prevent plastic pollution in the country, the Government has notified Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016. The generators of waste under the Rules have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover the segregated waste to the local bodies or agencies authorised by them or registered waste pickers or registered recyclers. For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic, provisions have been made for registration of all plastic recyclers with respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees. Every urban local body has been made responsible for setting up of infrastructure for collection, segregation and processing, including recycling and disposal of plastic waste. The local bodies have also been made responsible for creation of awareness among all stakeholders about their respective responsibilities. CPCB has issued guidelines for utilization of plastic waste, the key technologies prescribed are (i) utilization of plastic waste in road construction, (ii) Co-processing of plastic waste in cement kilns, (iii) Conversion of plastic waste into liquid RDF (oil) and (iv) Disposal of plastic waste through Plasma Pyrolysis Technology (PPT). (C) & (d) The local bodies in association with the state urban/rural development departments have been mandated to ensure compliance of the provisions of the SWM Rules 2016, including the setting up of  material recovery facilities with sufficient space for sorting of recyclable materials; collecting waste from vegetable, fruit,flower, meat, poultry and fish market and promote setting up of decentralized compost plant or bio-methanation plant at suitable locations; facilitate construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure including bio-methanation, microbial composting, vermi-composting, anaerobic digestion or any other appropriate processing for bio-stabilization of biodegradable wastes;As on date, there are 1480 functional waste to compost plants (centralized) with processing capacity of 78,611 tonnes of waste per day, and 564 plants are under construction, with approximate capacity of 22,753 tonnes per day. *****
