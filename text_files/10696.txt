ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) : 		The details of State/UT-wise actual demand and supply of electricity in terms of Energy during the current year i.e., 2019-20 (upto November, 2019), is given at Annexure. Most of the States/UTs have a ‘Nil’ or marginal demand-supply gap in terms of Energy. Even this marginal gap is on account of factors, other than adequacy of power availability in the country. It may be mentioned that the generation of electricity and its supply is commensurate to the energy requirement of the States/UTs and the overall surplus that may be available with the above said States/UTs is utilized by the deficit ones through various market based contracts.(b) & (c) : 	The states/state power utilities have to meet their power requirement through a resource adequacy plan which is duly approved by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). Each state individually also has to meet the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) which is monitored by their respective SERCs. For meeting RPO, the states tie up renewable power from the surplus states. This has been incentivised by giving waiver of interstate transmission charges for the solar and wind projects commissioned up to December, 2022. Further as the cost of power from renewable sources has become quite competitive, the states are planning to augment their power purchase portfolio with more shares from renewables. Renewable rich states have also planned to increase the capacity as this will enable the states to earn additional revenue. Thus, all the states are contributing in promoting the renewable energy sources.**************
