ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	A total of 24000 samples from 71 districts were collected and tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in May 2020. The nationwide sero-prevalence was found to be less than 1%. Smaller serosurveys have been conducted in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Indore, Chennai, Mumbai and Pune, where a seroprevalence has been found to be 7-28%. A second National sero-surveillance has commenced. (b):	Infection is the entry and development or multiplication of an infectious agent (SARS-CoV-2 virus) in humans. Infection is not synonymous with infectious disease (COVID-19). The result of infection may be inapparent or manifest. Hence there will be difference between infections among the populations and the actual cases reported.(c):	Government of India followed a graded scientific approach to formulate a testing strategy.  Government followed the World Health Organization benchmark of testing 140 samples / million population/ day. India is testing 875 samples/ million population/day which is more than 6 times the WHO recommendation. (d) & (e):	Indian Council of Medical Research in its latest strategy (issued on 4th September 2020) has allowed for ‘on-demand’ testing.
