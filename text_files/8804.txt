ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	There is no proposal under consideration of the Government to purchase pan methi by bringing it within the ambit of support price. Government presently fixes MSP for 22 mandated agricultural crops viz. paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed, cotton, wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower, jute and copra and Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/ Departments concerned and other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for Toria and de-husked Coconut are also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra respectively. For agricultural and horticultural commodities, which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme, Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) is implemented to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below cost of production. It is implemented on the specific request of the concerned State/UT Government, which has to bear 50% of the loss (25% in case of North-Eastern States), if any, incurred on its implementation.******
