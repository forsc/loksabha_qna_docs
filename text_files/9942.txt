The approximate premium received under PMJJBY / PMSBY during the last three policy years (1st June to 31st May) and for the current year (1st June to 30th September, 2019) is placed at Annexure C.The number and amount of claims settled under the said schemes for the last three years and the current year (up to 30.09.2019), State/UT and bank-wise is placed at Annexure D, E, F and G respectively.(e): Complaints are received from beneficiaries of PMJJBY and PMSBY for non-payment of claims from time to time.

A Mission Office (Jansuraksha) has also been set up in DFS to monitor the implementation of these schemes. Direct complaints related to both these schemes are followed up with banks and insurance companies by Mission Office Jansuraksha for their prompt redressal.   A total of 487 complaints have been received under PMSBY and 439 complaints have been received under PMJJBY out of which 483 and 435 complaints have been disposed off under PMSBY and PMJJBY respectively.*****
