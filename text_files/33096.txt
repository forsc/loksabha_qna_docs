India and US are also cooperating under the framework of DTTI (Defence Technology and Trade Initiative) for facilitating joint development of mutually agreed technology.Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) with USA was established to resolve issue in cooperation and alignment of systems; to ensure increasing flow of technology and investment; developing capabilities and partnership in co-development and co-production; and intensifying cooperation in research and development.Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under Ministry of Defence cooperates on Research and Development (R&D) projects with organizations under United States’ Department of Defence under the guidance of a US-India Joint Technical Group since 1995.(b):	Yes, Sir.
