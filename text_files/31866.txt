ANSWER




(a)       In West Bengal a total of 576 Projects and 1,19,481 Anganwadi Centres have been sanctioned out of this all  are operationalised catering to the needs of   87.69 lakh beneficiaries. Under Anganwadi Services, a package of six services, comprising Supplementary nutrition; pre-school non-formal education; nutrition and health education; immunization; health checkup; and referral services are provided to targeted beneficiaries i.e. all children below 6 years of age, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers. Three of the six services namely, Immunization, Health Check-up and Referral Services are delivered through Public Health Infrastructure under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.As far as schemes related to women empowerment is concerned  Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) Scheme was approved in November, 2017 as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation. The scheme aims to facilitate inter-sectoral convergence of schemes and programs meant for women. The scheme is implemented through State Governments (including West Bengal) and UT Administrations with a cost sharing ratio of 60:40 between Centre and States except for North East & Special Category States where the funding ratio is 90:10. For Union Territories 100% central funding is provided. (b) Government has not constituted any task force for  implementation of above  said schemes. However from  time to time, Government has taken many steps for strengthening Anganwadi Services. These include revision of cost norms of supplementary nutrition, provision of construction of Anganwadi Centres under Convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), provision of drinking water and sanitation facilities at AWCs under Swachhta Action Plan (SAP) etc. There have been sustained engagements with State Governments for review and improvement including recent interactions to discuss different implementation related issues to strengthen services. Further, streamlined guidelines were issued on 13.01.2021, covering several aspects such as quality assurance, roles and responsibilities of duty holders, procedure for procurement, integrating AYUSH concepts and Data management and monitoring through “Poshan Tracker” for transparency, efficiency and accountability in delivery of Supplementary Nutrition has been issued.  The Ministry of Women and Child Development undertakes regular VCs and meetings to review/monitor implementation of the Aanganwadi Services/MSK scheme.  (c) & (d)      Does not arise. *******
