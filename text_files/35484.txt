ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is delivering the skills to the youth across the country through its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). PMKVY (except PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16)) has two components, namely, Central component being implemented through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), and State component being implemented through State Skill Development Mission (SSDM) of the State/UT. Under Central component of PMKVY, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. Since inception of the PMKVY, i.e., 2015, as on 31.12.2021, an amount of Rs. 8,590.29 crore has been disbursed to implementing agency, i.e., NSDC towards the implementation of the scheme. Under State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States for the implementation of scheme through SSDMs. Since incorporation of State component, i.e., 2016, as on 31.12.2021, an amount of Rs. 1,224.82 crore has been disbursed to States for the implementation of the scheme. The State-wise funds allocated, disbursed and utilized by the State under PMKVY 2.0 and PMKVY 3.0, as on 31.12.2021, is given at Annexure. (b)       Under PMKVY, placement is not mandatory component. However, in order to enhance the placement under the short term training of PMKVY, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates.  Also, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers.             Further, based on the learning from implementation of PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16) and 2.0 (2016-20), the orientation of the scheme has been changed from being supply driven to demand driven under PMKVY 3.0. The demand driven and bottom-up approach has been provisioned to boost demand for job roles which are prevailing at regional/local level. In addition, informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy which aims to support the self-employment as well. This scheme also supports the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs. Ministry has also launched Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, which acts as a central directory of skilled workforce registered and certified under Skill India Portal (SIP), across all schemes at central and state level. (c)        The number of candidates trained, assessed and certified under PMKVY, since inception, i.e., 2015, in the Hazaribagh district of State of Jharkhand is given below: Trained	Assessed	Certified24,887	22,836	19,801 Dropouts have been observed at various stages in the training life cycle. Reasons for decreasing numbers at different stages of training are given below: •	Enrolment vs Training: After registration of candidates on the portal, some candidates are unable to turn up for the training and some candidates drop out during the training period.•	Training vs Assessment: This difference is largely attributed to trained candidates not appearing for assessment.•	Assessment vs Certification: The reason for the gap in number of candidates assessed and candidates certified is attributed to the failure of candidates in assessment tests.
