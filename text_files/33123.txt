MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFAREAND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a):	Import of urea for direct agriculture use is made on Government account through State Trading Enterprises (STEs) under the Foreign Trade Policy of the Government. During the year 2020-21, 98.28 LMT of urea has been imported on Government account.Further, all P&K fertilizers are covered under Open General License (OGL) under the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme. They are imported by the companies on commercially viable terms.Quantity of DAP, MOP and NPK fertilizers imported in the country during 2020-21 is given in the table below:Import of fertilizers (DAP, MOP and NPK) during 2020-21   Qty in LMTYear	                              DAP	  MOP	             NPK	                            As reported by the companies2020-21	                             48.82	   42.27	    13.90(b):	No.(c):	No.(d) to (e): 	The MRP of Urea is statutorily notified by the Government which is Rs. 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable) with effect from 1st March, 2018.Since then there has been no increase in the MRP of Urea.There has been an increasing price trend of the raw materials and finished P&K fertilizers in the international market.However, in the wake of the volatility in prices in the international markets, GoI has analyzed the situation and the prices under NBS subsidy for 2021-22 were notified twice on 20.05.2021 and on 13.10.2021 in order to control the prices of fertilizers. The subsidy rates during FY 2021-22 is as under:From 01.04.2021 to 19.05.2021S. No.	Nutrients	NBS (Rs. Per Kg of Nutrient1.	   N	                18.7892.	   P	                14.8883.

NPK 12-32-16	                                    2000This subsidy increase on P&K fertilizer under NBS scheme helped in making P&K fertilizers available at affordable prices to farming community. The latest notified subsidy rates under NBS scheme is placed at Annexure ‘A’.To ensure that the P&K fertilizers are made available at reasonable price to farmers, GoI has also issued reasonableness guidelines to check the reasonableness of MRP of P&K fertilizers.  A copy is placed at Annexure ‘B’.

In continuation of this Division’s OM No. 23011/5/2013-MRP dated 03.05.2019 on the subject mentioned, the undersigned is directed to issue the detailed guidelines for evaluation of reasonableness of MRP’s of P&K fertilizers under the NBS Scheme to be effective from 01.04.2012 as below:i.	The present format of data collection will continue to be used for collection of cost data from the P&K Companies.ii.	The online module for online submission of cost data by the companies will be developed by NIC at the earliest.iii.	After implementation of the online module of data submission, the Companies will be required to submit the final audited cost data once in a year for the previous financial year by August of every year.iv.	In case of non-submission of cost data by the companies within the stipulated time, the further subsidy payment of the company will be stopped till the time the company furnishes the requisite cost data to the Department of Fertilizers.v.	The Department of Fertilizer will complete the process of examination of reasonableness for the previous financial year by October of every year. In case of late submission of the cost data, DoF will complete the reasonable exercise within two months of the submission of the cost data by the company.vi.	The profits earned above 12% will be treated as ‘unreasonable profit’.vii.	No deduction of Taxes/Dividends paid by the companies will be granted while computing the reasonable profit.viii.	¬The unreasonable amount of profit i.e. profit over and above reasonable profit will be recovered from the defaulting companies.ix.	If a company is habitual defaulter of fixing unreasonable MRPs, matter will be placed before IMC to consider taking action against the company which may include levy of penal interest on the recovery, removable of any grade/grades of fertilizers of that company or removal of the fertilizer company itself from the NBS scheme.x.	If profit margin of a company for a product is found unreasonable, company will be provided an opportunity to represent/furnish inputs prior to adjustments from the subsidy payments. In doing so, any onetime factor will also be appropriately considered. In such cases company will be issued notice to represent/furnish comments within 14 days. FICC will be asked to examine the comments received from the company within 15 days and thereafter final decision to be taken by DoF within 30 days of receipt of company’s response. If the company doesn’t reply within 14 days, it will be presumed that company has nothing to represent and accordingly, the amount over and above the reasonable profit will be recovered.xi.	Profit margin will be evaluated for each product/company wise instead of unit wise subject to the condition that the company maintains same MRP for a particular product irrespective of the unit in which it is manufactured. However, reasonableness evaluation of indigenous and imported products will be done separately.xii.	Formula for calculating the reasonableness of MRP will be as below:-If Net MRP + Subsidy <= 1.12* Cost of sales, profit margin is reasonable.If Net MRP + Subsidy >1.12*Cost of sales, profit margin is unreasonable.Here, Net MRP = MRP-Discount-Dealer’s Margin and2.	This issues with the approval of Competent Authority.
