ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (e): Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, therefore, majority of theschools are under the jurisdiction of the respective State and Union Territory (UT)Government. Hence, the recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers as alsomanagement of the schools are primarily in the domain of the respective State Government andUT Administration. As per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE)2018-19 (provisional), out of the total number of teachers in Government primary, upperprimary and secondary schools in rural areas, 40.56% are female teachers and the total numberof schools having Kachcha building blocks in rural areas is 24940.The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in itsSchedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schoolswhich are 30:1 and 35:1 respectively. As per the framework of erstwhile scheme RashtriyaMadhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA)- now subsumed under Samagra Shiksha, PTR atsecondary level should be 30:1. As per UDISE 2017-18 (provisional), the PTR at national levelfor primary schools is 23:1, for upper primary schools is 25:1 and for Secondary level is 26:1.The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due toretirement and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength. However,Ministry of Human Resource Development has been requesting all the States and UTGovernments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment, forwhich the Ministry issues advisories to all States and UTs from time to time.Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme ofSamagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additionalteachers to maintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for variouslevels of schooling****
