ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) 	Adequate funds have been allocated for the Central Sector Scheme - National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS). The final budgetary allocation for NMHS for previous year (2019-2020) was Rs. 47 Crore. The initial budget allocation for NMHS for current financial year (2020-21) was Rs. 50 Crore which has been reduced to Rs. 30 Crore at RE stage. The budgetary allocation is reduced after taking in account less expenditure on the account challenges posed by COVID-19 due to which field activities could not be taken up. Further, there exists an option to seek more funds at the time of RE/ supplementary demand for grant.(c) 	Since the inception of the Scheme, a total of 171 demand driven action research projects have been sanctioned. Out of these 171 research projects, 42 projects have been completed while 114 are on-going and 15 new projects were sanctioned over this past year.(d) 	According to the Global Climate Risk Index (GCRI) 2021 by Germanwatch, India is ranked as the 7th most vulnerable country globally. Mozambique, Zimbabwe and The Bahamas are reported to be the most affected countries, followed by Japan, Malawi, Afghanistan and India. Earlier, in GCRI 2020, India was ranked at 5th most vulnerable country globally. (e) 	The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides the overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States /Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters such as cyclones, floods and heat wave. National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) has been formulated to 	assist all stakeholders including State Governments in disaster risk management of various hazards including hazards related to climate change.Further, Indian Meteorological Department is implementing advance and early warning systems to facilitate timely evacuation in the event of floods/ cyclones and to prevent the loss of lives. At the United Nations Secretary General’s Summit in 2019, India also launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, a platform for generating and exchanging knowledge to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development.*****
