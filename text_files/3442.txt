ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors and is generally constant. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing progressively due to increase in population. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability of many regions of the country is much below the national average and may result in water stress / scarce conditions.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources including tackling of water crisis are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to tackle water crisis in the country.Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. Through National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), a centrally sponsored scheme, technical and financial assistance are provided to States for providing safe drinking water in rural areas. The NRDWP has been restructured to make it more competitive, result oriented and outcome based to reduce the slippages and inefficiencies in the rural drinking water supply.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with Mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. The water supply component includes augmentation of existing water supply system and water treatment plants; rehabilitation of old water supply system; rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water etc. During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha. and balance estimated cost of Rs.77,595 cr. (Central Assistance Rs.31342.50 cr.) have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019 along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Out of these 99 prioritized projects, AIBP works of 40 prioritized projects have been reported to be completed/almost completed. Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources. Some of the initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control ground water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf(c) State-wise details of the projects in water supply sector under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) is given at Annexure-I.The State wise details of the ninety-nine major/medium irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) in the country is given at Annexure - II.Details of State-wise aquifer maps and management plans prepared under “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” is given in Annexure III.**** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †3158 to be answered on 11.07.2019 regarding “Water Crisis”.State-wise details of the projects in water supply sector under AMRUT.
