ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d):	Since education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of the State Governments, it is the responsibility of the respective State Governments to implement the provisions of para 8.7 of the National Education Policy (NEP) – 2020 for the schools under their jurisdiction. So far the Kendriya Vidyalaya (KVs),  Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNVs) and other schools like Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS), Sainik Schools, etc. which are controlled by various Ministries of Central Government and are affiliated with Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the CBSE has been designated to act as School Standard Setting Authority (SSSA). CBSE has also been requested to prepare standards as per Chapter 8 of the NEP for all these schools and prepare an online disclosure system. CBSE has also been advised to lay down, for all its schools, parameters in addition to those laid down by respective states SSSA for the purpose of examination, registration, extension of affiliation, etc. Public and private schools (except the schools that are managed / aided / controlled by the Central government) will be assessed and accredited on the same criteria, benchmarks, processes, emphasizing online and offline public disclosure and transparency, so as to ensure that public-spirited private schools are encouraged.*****
