ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c): The establishment of eight new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) at Ropar, Patna, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, Gandhinagar, Bhubaneswar, Indore and Mandi during 2008-09 faced time and cost overruns primarily due to delay in identification, selection and transfer of the land by the respective State Governments. Other factors which contributed to delay in infrastructure development include grant of various clearances by respective State/local authorities, change of approved project cost as per revised CPWD rates, exclusion of critical cost components like site specific expenditures, Covid-19 pandemic situation resulting in less availability of material and labour due to restricted mobility, etc. All these IITs are functioning from their permanent campus. The progress was reviewed regularly by the Government and also by the concerned IIT in their Building and Works Committee, Finance Committee and Board of Governors. *****
