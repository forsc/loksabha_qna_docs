ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has been delivering skills through various schemes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Sikhshan Sansthan (JSS), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), to youths across the country including Uttar Pradesh.Amongst other major schemes for skilling run by other Ministries, Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Youjana (DDU-GKY) in the field of skill development for rural poor youth under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), through private sector organizations in Districts.  DDU-GKY is a placement linked skill development program for rural poor youth under NRLM since September, 2014. Rural Youth in the age group of 15-35 years are covered under this scheme. DDU-GKY guidelines provide for earmarking 50% of the funds for SCs and STs and 15% for minorities. Further, one third beneficiaries of the respective categories including general category covered under the scheme should be women. DDU-GKY follows a 3-tier implementation architecture for implementation. National level is responsible for policy, funding of central share and technical support, while State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs)/ State Skills Missions are responsible for funding of State share, implementation and monitoring controls. Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) including private training partners, are responsible for mobilization, training and placements. (b)	 Yes, Sir. All the schemes are implemented either wholly or partially through private organisations. DDU-GKY provides training for rural poor youth and the training centres are run by PIAs including private training partners. (c)	Under PMKVY-STT training is being imparted through empanelled training centres to unemployed youth of the country, including private institutions. Further, Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode throughout the country. The Ministry is also implementing the Scheme of Jan Shikshan Sansthan through Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) to impart vocational skills in non-formal mode to non-literate, neo-literates, persons with rudimentary level of education upto 8th and school drop-outs upto 12th standard in the age group of 15-45 years. The priority groups are women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities and other backward sections of the society. In addition to above short-term training, Directorate General of Training (DGT) under MSDE is implementing long duration vocational courses through government and private Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) which offer range of one or two years’ vocational /skill training courses. The district-wise number of operational training centres under PMKVY, JSS, NAPS and ITIs in the State of Uttar Pradesh are attached at Annexure I, II, III and IV respectively. The District wise details of training centres under DDU-GKY in Uttar Pradesh is attached at Annexure-V. (d)	Yes, Sir.(e)	Empanelled training centres of PMKVY are being monitored effectively through various methodologies including information technology (IT) interventions and measures, namely, self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skills Development Management System (SDMS), Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres (SMART), Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS), social media platform, etc. Under the scheme, PMKVY Monitoring Committee review and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Also, the Committee has formulated penalty grid (approved by Steering Committee for PMKVY) for taking action against erring / non-compliant training centres / stakeholders. Based on the penalty grid, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), the implementing agency of PMKVY under MSDE, has suspended training centres for non-compliance of PMKVY guidelines on multiple parameters and periodically publishes the list on PMKVY official website. So far, 306 Training Centres (TCs) have been suspended across the different locations. Regional Directorate of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (RDSDEs) is continuously monitoring CTS. Actions have been taken against ITIs against which complaints were received or not having up to date information. Directorate of Jan Shikshan Sansthan is monitoring the JSS scheme through review meetings and online web portal (jss.gov.in). Action has been taken against 4 JSSs (since July, 2018), i.e., 4 JSSs have been closed, not having up to date information or against which complaints were received. Under Apprenticeship scheme, State Apprenticeship Advisors and Assistant Apprenticeship Advisors monitor the scheme at state level. Regional Apprenticeship Advisor from Central Govt can also inspect these establishments for compliance and training quality.DDU-GKY has detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to monitor these training centres. Since the details in the above Annexures are too lengthy, all of them (Annexures I to V} are available on the website of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship at the following link (https://msde.gov.in/en/useful-links/parl-ques/lok-sabha).
