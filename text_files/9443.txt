In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.Central Assistance (CA) for restoration of water bodies is provided by the Ministry under the scheme of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, which is a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). The scheme aims at restoring the lost irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of existing water bodies. Under the scheme, 2219 water bodies have been taken up for restoration in various States since XII Plan onwards, out of which 1160 water bodies have been reported to be completed upto March, 2019. Total Central Assistance amounting to Rs.369.11 crore has been released to the States upto March, 2019 for these water bodies.Contd…P/2//2//Works under the category “Renovation of Traditional Water Bodies” are also taken up through MGNREGA and works of 93086 water bodies are reported to be completed with an expenditure of Rs.2368.19 crore during 2018-19.(b)   States have not reported any incidence in this regard to this Ministry.(c)  Government of India has launched Jal JeevanMishan (JJM) which aims at providing Functional Household Tap Connections to every rural household by 2024 at the service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd).

As per the latest assessment (2017), out of the total 6881 numbers of assessment units, 1186 units have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Recharge. In addition, there are 313 ‘Critical’ units and 972 ‘Semi-Critical’ units. Six blocks of Dausa district have been categorised as ‘Over-exploited’.Initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water comes under the purview of concerned State Government. However, Central Government is also taking several measures towards sustainable management of ground water resources in the country.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable demand side and supply side interventions.*****
