ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): The Ministry of Civil Aviation has issued guidelines for RT-PCR testing on pilot basis at the entry airport for the arriving international transfer passengers in the country. The facility is already functional at Delhi and Mumbai airports. The setting up of this facility at other airports is subject to necessary permission/approvals/quarantine guidelines issued by the concerned State/UT Governments. ;(c) Ministry of Civil Aviation has issued detailed general instructions and guidelines to be followed by the passengers and specific operating guidelines for major stakeholders (Airlines, Airports, Ground Handling Agencies, etc.). These guidelines specify certain safety measures, which include Protection kit to each passenger (Three layered masks, face shields and sanitizers), as the safety measures, to contain the transmission of COVID-19 during air travel. Further, high quality High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters for recirculation of air are available in the aircrafts. Also, the duration of air travel is normally of limited hours. Further, after the suspension of domestic flight operations from 25th March, 2020 to 24th May, 2020, domestic air services including RCS operations were recommenced with effect from 25.05.2020 in a calibrated manner in consultation with the state governments.
