Under the Scheme, Government of India had sanctioned an amount of Rs. 872.6 Crore for the State of Madhya Pradesh based on the un-electrified household data submitted by the State. Since launch of the Saubhagya scheme and till 28.2.2021, Rs. 413.78 Crore has been released to the State of Madhya Pradesh. The year-wise details of funds sanctioned and released to the State of Madhya Pradesh are as under:-(Rupees in Crore)Name of Scheme 	Sanctioned Amount	Grant released till 28.02.2021		2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	Total Saubhagya	872.6	260.37	147.09	-	6.32	413.79(b) :		The Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) were prepared by the Discoms of the State as per their approved Schedule of Rates (SoR).

Under Saubhagya, the tendering for award of contracts and implementation of works is done by the respective State Power Utilities / Project Implementing Agencies; and in the case of Madhya Pradesh, awards were placed by three utilities viz. (i) Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran, Indore, (ii)Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited, Bhopal, (iii) Madhya Pradesh Poorv Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited, Jabalpur.

Further, no such request has been received or approved for using the sanctioned amount under Saubhagya for other works. (c) to (e) : 	Government of India has appointed REC Ltd as the Nodal Agency for the Scheme.
