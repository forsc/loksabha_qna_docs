ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Some of the cotton produced in India like Suvin (37-39mm), DCH-32 (34-36MM) etc. are longest in length and suitable for manufacturing finer yarn. Mostly, 32.5 mm to 36mm cotton is grown in some parts of Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. However, in Telangana, generally 28mm to 31mm staple length cotton is grown which is long staple cotton. (b):	The Government of India initiated a step for promotion of Indian Cotton under the brand name “KASTURI COTTON INDIA” through Textiles Committee. ICAR-CIRCOT provided necessary technical support in the form of test parameters and acceptance criteria for branding of Indian cotton. The proposal for setting up centers of ICAR- All India Coordinated Research Project on Cotton at Warangal and Adilabad has been initiated for conceptualization by the Department of Agriculture and Research, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. ***
