                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	As on 30.09.2019, there are 1366 operational cotton and man-made fibre textile mills in the country. The state-wise/UT-wise number of operational mills is at Annexure-I. In addition, National Textile Corporation (NTC) has                       23 operational mills as per details in Annexure-II.(b): 	While 425 new cotton and man-made fibre textile mills in Non-Small Scale Industry sector (Non-SSI) and three new mills by NTC were enlisted by the Office of Textile Commissioner, Mumbai during year 2009-2010 to 2018-2019 (up to 30.09.2019), 230 cotton and man-made fibre textile mills in Non-SSI sector and  two NTC mills have closed during the same period as per details in Annexure- III.  State-wise details of all closed cotton/man-made fibre textiles mills as on 30.09.2019 are at Annexure IV.(c): Government of India has introduced various schemes to strengthen textile sector. Amended Technology Upgradation Scheme (ATUFS), in place of the existing Revised Restructured Technology Fund Scheme (RRTUFS), was implemented with effect from 12.01.2016 for technology upgradation of the textile industry. The scheme would facilitate augmenting of investment, productivity, quality, employment, exports along with import substitution in the textile industry. It will also indirectly promote investment in textile machinery (having benchmarked technology) manufacturing. Further, other Schemes like Technology Mission on Technical Textiles (TMTT), Scheme for Usage of Agro-textiles in North East Region, Scheme for Promoting Usage of Geotechnical Textiles in North-Eastern Region, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Integrated Textile Processing Development (IPDS) are also aimed at strengthening the textile industry and thereby improving productivity and employment opportunities.
