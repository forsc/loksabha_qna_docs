                                                        MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a to d): Setting up of Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and its functioning comes within the domain of the State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts.As per information received from the High Courts, 914 FTCs are functional in 23 States/UTs as on October, 2021 dealing with cases of heinous crimes, civil cases related towomen, children, senior citizens, HIV/AIDS etc and property related cases pending for more than 5 years as recommended by 14th Finance Commission. Special courts are set up in the country on specific matters by the concerned Ministry /Department which administer these special statutes. In pursuance to the direction of Hon''ble Supreme Court of India''s Order dated 01.11.2017 and 14.12.2017 in Writ Petition (Civil) 699/2016 [Ashwini Kumar Upadhyaya Vs Union of India &Anr] case, 12 Special Courts were set up in 11 States [NCT of Delhi-02, Andhra Pradesh-01, Telangana-1, Karnataka-1, Kerala-1, Tamil Nadu-1, Maharashtra-1, Madhya Pradesh-1, Uttar Pradesh-1. Bihar-1 and West Bengal-1] for expeditious trial and disposal of criminal cases involving elected MPs/MLAs. 10 such Special Courts are presently functional except Special Court of Kerala and Bihar.The Government of India is also implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme since October 2019 for setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including 389 exclusive POCSO (e-POCSO) courts for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO Act. The Scheme which started in Oct 2019, has been extended up to 31.03.2023. 681 FTSCs including 381 e-POCSO Courts are presently functional in 27 States/UTs.These FTCs have disposed more than 31.92 lakh cases from 2015 till Oct 2021. The FTSCs have disposed 64,217 cases as on 31.10.2021. The above case disposal figures shows how FTCs and FTSCs have helped in swift disposal of pending cases. The issue of setting up of FTSCs and their early operationalization has been taken up with concerned States/UTs at various level from time to time. Minister of Law & Justice has addressed letters to Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of High Courts in this regard. In addition, regular review meetings with officials of the States/UTs and High Court functionaries are being held from time to time for operationalization of remaining FTSCsso asto further reduce the burden on judiciary. However, the details of the average time taken by these courts from the time of filing of case to rendering a verdict being dynamic in nature is not centrally maintained. **************
