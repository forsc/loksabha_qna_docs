ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b) The Department of Pharmaceuticals has an existing Scheme, namely, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) under which quality generic medicines are being sold at affordable prices through dedicated outlets known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs).  In order to ensure easy availability of the menstrual health services to all women across India, the “Janaushadhi Suvidha Oxy-Biodegradable Sanitary Napkin” was launched, which are available for sale in all Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) across the country @ Rs. 1.00 per sanitary pad. The Jan Aushadhi Suvidha comes with a special additive, which makes it biodegradable when it comes in contact with oxygen after being discarded. This ensures ‘Swachhta, Swasthya and Suvidha’ for the poor and underprivileged women in the country.(c) & (d) With a view to address the challenges facing in manufacturing of medical devices in India vis-à-vis other major manufacturing economies, a “Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Promoting Domestic Manufacturing of Medical Devices” has been approved to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the Medical Devices Sector. Under the scheme, financial incentive is to be given to selected companies at the rate of 5% of incremental sales of medical devices manufactured in India and covered under the Target segments of the scheme, for a period of five (5) years. Further, a scheme called “Promotion of Medical Device Parks” has been approved under which financial assistance is to be provided for creation of common infrastructure facilities in Medical Device Parks proposed by the State Governments and selected under the scheme. *****
