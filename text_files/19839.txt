ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR) (a) to (d):  The Government of India had announced AatmaNirbhar Bharat Packages (ANB) 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 on 13th  May, 2020 to 17th  May, 2020,  12th  October, 2020  and 12th November 2020 respectively.  The Aatmanirbhar Bharat Packages comprise of various long-term schemes/ programmes/ policies announced with the objective of fighting COVID-19 and to make the country self-reliant.     The Government has also announced a Rs 1.70 Lakh Crore Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) on 26.03.2020 to help the poor in the fight against Corona Virus.  A Statement indicating details of  PMGKP and ANB are at Annexure-I.   The astute support provided by the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission has placed the economy firmly on the path of revival.  While the lockdown resulted in a 23.9 per cent contraction in GDP in Q1 (2020-21), the recovery has been a V-shaped one as seen in the 7.5 per cent decline in Q2 and the recovery across all key economic indicators.  Starting July, a resilient V-shaped recovery is underway, as demonstrated by the recovery in GDP growth in Q2 after the sharp decline in Q1.  Key indicators like E-way bills, rail freight, GST collections and power consumption have surpassed previous year levels.  Further, the reignited inter and intra state movement and record-high monthly GST collections have marked the unlocking of industrial and commercial activity.  (e):   The Government announces schemes/programmes and undertakes various measures to boost the economy from time to tame based on the requirement. (f):	In view of the resource requirement to meet challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic, additional borrowing limit of upto 2 percent of GSDP, which is equivalent to Rs.4,27,302 crore has been allowed to States over and above normal borrowing limit of 3 percent of GSDP for the year 2020-21.  One percent of this is subject to implementation of following four specific State level refors, where weightage of each reform is 0.25 percent of GSDP: (a) Implementation of One Nation One Ration Card Scheme (b) Ease of doing business reforms (c) Urban Local Body/Utility reforms & (d) Power Sector Reforms.  Out of 2 percent of GSDP, permission of 0.5 percent(untied) of projected GSDP amounting to Rs.1,06,830 crore was issued to States for raising open market borrowing (OMB) during 2020-21.  Also, the condition of implementing at least three out of four reforms for availing 0.5% of GSDP was relaxed for States opting for option 1 of borrowing for meeting the shortfall arising on account of GST implementation.  All States have already favoured Option-1 and additional borrowing permission of Rs.1,06,830 crore has been granted.   Many States have carried out the stipulated reforms and thus have been granted reform linked borrowing permission.  Till 02.02.2021, States have been allotted additional borrowing for implementation of One Nation One Ration Card System, 11 States for implementation of ease of doing business reforms, 5 States for implementation of local body reforms and 2 States for implementation of Direct Benefit Scheme to farmers under power sector reform. Total reform linked additional borrowing permission issued till 02.02.2021 to the States stands at Rs.73,257 crore.   Under the scheme ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure’, special assistance has been provided to the States Governments in the form of 50 year interest free loan up to an overall sum not exceeding Rs.12,000 crore.  Capital Expenditure proposals of 27 States amounting to Rs.11179.5 crore have been approved and an amount of Rs.5589.70 crore has been releases as first instalment to them in the Financial Year 2020-21. A Statement indicating details of expenditure incurred by various Ministries/Department under ANB, wherever applicable is at Annexures-II.  Further, a Statement indicating benefits provided under ANB & PMGKP to mitigate the suffering of people due to COVID-19 and MSMEs [through Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) is at Annexure-III.*****
