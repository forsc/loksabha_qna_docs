ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) and (b) : The work of Hansi-Meham-Rohtak (68.8 Km) Railway line was sanctioned in 2012-13 at a cost of  287.02 crore.  Anticipated cost of the project is  892 crore. An expenditure of  716.15 crore has been incurred on this work till June,2021.  Earthwork and blanketing has been completed except in those stretches affected for want of balance land acquisition, relocation of High tension electric lines and cutting of trees by Forest department. Completion of any Railway Project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, permission of tree cutting, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climate conditions etc. and all these factors affects the completion time of the project (s). As such, confirmed completion time of project cannot be ascertained at this stage.  Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project expeditiously.(c) and (d) :  Does not arise as Hansi is already connected to Hisar with existing rail line.*****
