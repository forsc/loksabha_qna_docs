The GoS has so far held seven meetings. The draft Request for Qualification and the draft Concession Agreement have been uploaded on the websites of Niti Aayog and Indian Railways for seeking feedback from the stakeholders. A tentative list of 107 Origin-Destination pairs (clusterwise) has been uploaded as annexure along with the draft Request for Qualification. (b)	At present, no passenger train service over Indian Railways network is being operated by private operators. Therefore, Passenger feedback in this regard does not arise.(c)	The likely revenue to be generated can be estimated only after the completion of the bidding process.(d)	The contours of the project are under finalization.*****
