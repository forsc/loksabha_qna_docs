Productivity varies considerably depending on the stocking density and quantity of feed given. This also varies from State to State and also depends on type of species. Therefore, the Department of Fisheries has not compiled such reports. Under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana(PMMSY), the Department of Fisheries has roped in National Productivity Council(NPC) to conduct a nation-wide sample study to assess production and productivity across regions, production systems and verities of species.*****
