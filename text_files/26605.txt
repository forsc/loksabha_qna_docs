ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	No Sir. The One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan is not yet enabled by the Government of West Bengal.(b): 	Since the ONORC plan empowers all National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, to lift their entitled foodgrains, from any electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) enabled Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice anywhere in the country or within the State/District/Town/Village – by using their same existing ration card or Aadhaar number, the migrant NFSA beneficiaries, as may be in West Bengal and vice-versa shall remain deprived from accessing their quota of subsidised foodgrains from any nearby FPS, due to non-availability of ONORC facility in the State.(c): 	Implementation of ONORC plan is a key component of a Central Sector Scheme, namely – Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS). So far, for the implementation of scheme and release of central funds, the Government of West Bengal has not yet signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with this Department.(d): 	The requisite ePoS devices with biometric authentication facilities are available in all Fair Price Shops of West Bengal. Further, the Department has regularly pursued with the State Government to enable the ONORC plan for the benefit of migrant NFSA beneficiaries at the earliest.***
