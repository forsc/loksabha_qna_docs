                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)  to (c) : 	In India, the Pesticides are regulated under the Insecticides Act 1968 and the insecticides Rule 1971. The Act regulates the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides with a view to prevent risk to human beings or animals, and for matters connected therewith. Registered pesticides are periodically reviewed with respect to their safety and efficacy. On receipt of new studies/ reports/ references/ information by the government from time to time, the review is done by appointing expert committees. Based upon the recommendations of such expert committees and after due consultation with Registration Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture has so far banned or phased out 46 pesticides and 4 pesticide formulations for import, manufacture or sale in the country. In addition, 8 pesticides registrations have been withdrawn and 9 pesticides have been placed under restricted use.While banning a pesticide, objection and suggestions received from the stakeholders on draft notifications are examined considering all aspects related to technical, scientific requirements, alternatives available, farmers’ interest, safety, toxicity and efficacy concerns, ban status in other countries etc. and accordingly a final decision is taken. In last five years the Government has banned following 18 pesticides i.e Benomyl, Carbaryl, Diazinon, Fenarimol, Fenthion, Linuron, Methyl Ethyl Mercury Chloride (MEMC), Methyl Parathion, Sodium Cyanide, Thiometon, Tridemorph, Trifluralin, Alachlor, Dichlorvos, Phorate, Phosphamidon, Triazophos, Trichlorfon.(d): 	State Government of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Kerala, Goa, Assam, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur; Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, Chandigarh have reported that no case of use of banned pesticides have been reported in their States. However, Government of India is implementing a central sector scheme, “Monitoring of Pesticide Residues at National Level”, under which samples of vegetables, fruits and other crops are collected from the retail outlets, markets, farm gate etc. and analyzed by enlisted NABL laboratories for pesticide residues. Under the scheme, a total of 30,664 samples of fruits, vegetables and other crops were collected during 2019-20 and analyzed for the presence of pesticide residues; and residues of banned pesticides have been detected in 78 (0.25%) samples. Reports of such instances have been shared with concerned State Governments to take appropriate legal and corrective actions as per the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968.   (e) & (f): 	Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is implementing the ''Sub-Mission on Plant Protection with a mandate to popularize adoption of Integrated Pest Management through training and demonstration in crops. Integrated Pest Management is an environmentally friendly comprehensive ecological approach through which farmers are made aware about the minimum dependence on chemical pesticides, judicious use of chemical pesticides and use as per the prescriptions given in the label and leaflets. The Government has established 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centers in 28 States and two Union Territory in the country which imparts trainings to farmers and State Extension Officers through Farmers Field Schools, short and long duration training programmes on Integrated Pest Management strategies. During the trainings, major emphasis is given on judicious use of chemical pesticide as a last resort, safety in use of pesticides, alternate tools for pest management viz; cultural, physical, mechanical methods of pest control as well as use of bio-pesticides and bio-control agents, effects of pesticides on natural enemies of pests, do’s and don’ts of pesticide including proper application equipment and the technique. ******
