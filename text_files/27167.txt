ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b)   Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with Pollution Control Boards/Committees in different States/Union Territories (UTs) have been monitoring  the water quality of rivers and other water bodies, including in the state of Odisha, through a network of 4294  monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Of these 4294 monitoring stations, monitoring is done at 344 locations in Odisha, including rivers (133 nos.), lakes (7 nos.), ponds (8 nos.), canals (9 nos.), drains (94 nos.), ground water (90 nos.) and sewage treatment plants (STPs) (3 nos.). Based on water quality monitoring results, pollution assessment of rivers has been carried out by CPCB from time to time. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. Of these 351 stretches, 19 polluted stretches have been identified in Odisha as per details given at Annexure.(c) & (d)   Central Water Commission (CWC) is also carrying out water quality monitoring at key locations covering all important/major rivers in the country and had published a report on ‘Status of trace and toxic metals in Indian rivers’ in August, 2019. As per the analysis of data for the period May, 2014 to April, 2018 at 424 water quality stations, it was found that 137 water quality stations were within acceptable  limits  with  respect  to  toxic metals  according  to  BIS:10500-2012.  101  stations were found Contd…P/2//2//beyond acceptable limits with respect to more than one toxic metal, only Iron concentration was found beyond acceptable limit at 156 stations, presence of Cadmium was found beyond acceptable limit at 3 stations, presence of Chromium was observed at 6 stations, presence of Nickel was found at 9 stations and Lead contamination was observed at 12 stations. Arsenic and Zinc concentrations were found within acceptable limits as per the BIS, and no toxicity with respect to Arsenic and Zinc was observed in the river water during the study period.(e)       Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments. It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs) and local bodies to ensure treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into rivers, water bodies or land to prevent and control of pollution therein.Based on the assessment of water quality, various measures are being taken both by the Central and the State Governments to prevent pollution of rivers.  River cleaning is a continuous process and the Central Government assists the State Governments and urban local bodies through the schemes of ‘Namami Gange’ and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) of Ministry of Jal Shakti. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the sanctioned cost of projects as Rs.5965.90 crore, and sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 MLD created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 346 projects, including 158 projects for sewage treatment of 4948 MLD and sewer network of 5213 kms., have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30235 crore. In addition, sewerage infrastructure is also created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs and National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA) programme of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.Discharge of industrial effluents is monitored by CPCB and the respective State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees through the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application (OA) No.673/2018 regarding polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement action plans for restoration of the said stretches in their jurisdiction within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.In addition, CPCB has in July, 2020 issued ‘Guidelines for Handling, Treatment and Disposal of Waste Generated during Treatment/Diagnosis/ Quarantine of COVID-19 Patients’, which does not permit disposal of bio-medical waste, including used masks and gloves, into the water bodies.*****  ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2806 to be answered on the 05/08/2021 regarding ‘POLLUTION LEVEL IN WATER BODIES’.Details of Polluted River Stretches identified in Odisha S NO	NAME OF RIVER	IDENTIFIED STRETCH	BOD RANGE/ MAX VALUE (MG/L)	PRIORITY CLASS1.
