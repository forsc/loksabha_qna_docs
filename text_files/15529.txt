ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) to (c): “Public Health” being a State subject, the primarily responsibility to initiate steps for promotion of Yoga fall under the purview of the respective State/ UT governments.  At the Central level, Ministry of AYUSH strives to promote Yoga among all segments of population through its three autonomous bodies namely Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY) and National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN). The details of steps taken to promote Yoga are given in Annexure.  (d) & (e): National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends Yoga as an integral part of Health and Physical Education (HPE).  As per NCF, 2005, Health and Physical Education (HPE) is a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X and optional from Class XI to XII. However, Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) has made Health and Physical Education compulsory in all classes from I-XII and has directed schools to keep one period of HPE for classes I-XII each day. At the graduation level, it is for the students to exercise the options available in the Universities / Colleges as per their choices.       Further, Education comes under the Concurrent List of the Constitution.  With majority of schools falling under respective State Examination Boards, the school curriculum is largely determined by State Governments.  *****
