ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is available for all farmers both loanee and non-loanee. However, the scheme is optional for the States.  The concerned State Government notifies the crops and areas under the Scheme.  The Scheme is compulsory for loanee farmers availing seasonal agricultural operation loans/Kisan Credit Card loans for notified crops/areas and voluntary for other farmers. Out of the total number of farmer applicants covered under the scheme over 80% farmers are small and margial farmers.  Year-wise details of subsidized number of farmers covered under the scheme, farmers who got claims on loss of their crops  and amount of claims are given in following table : Season	No. of  Farmer Applicants (in lakhs)	Farmer applicants who got claims (in lakhs)	Amount of Claims Paid (Rs. in crores)2016-17	580.60	148.40	166622017-18	527.10	174.30	217432018-19	563.90	165.10	18921** Provisional.Contd…2/--2-As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. However, settlement of claims in some States get delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data;  late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, etc.  However, this Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims.  Further, with a view to ensure better transparency, accountability,  timely payment of claims to the farmers and to make the scheme more farmer friendly, Government has comprehensively revised the Operational Guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) which have become effective from Rabi 2018-19.   To ensure optimal coverage under the scheme, the following provisions, which will facilitate early settlement of claims, making the scheme even more farmer friendly, have, inter-alia,  been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines:-(i)	Provision of 12% interest rate per annum to be paid by the Insurance Company to farmers for delay in settlement claims beyond 10 days of prescribed cut off date for payment of claims. (ii)	State Government have to pay 12% interest rate for delay in release of State share of Subsidy beyond three months of prescribed cut off date/submission of requisition by Insurance Companies.(iii)	Rationalization of methodology for calculation of Threshold Yield (TY) to calculate claims - Moving average of best 5 out of 7 years to be taken for calculation.(iv)	Time for intimation of loss due to localized calamities and post-harvest losses has been increased from 48 hours to 72 hours.(v)	Stratified grievance redressal mechanism viz. District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC), State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC).                                                            ********
