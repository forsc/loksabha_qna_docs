ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) to (c)  To promote grid connected solar rooftop systems on Government offices/buildings in the country, achievement linked incentives were being provided by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under its erstwhile Achievement Linked Incentives scheme for Government /PSU sector. Incentives up to 25% of benchmark cost in general category States/UTs and upto 60 % of benchmark cost in special category States/UTs have been provided depending upon the achievements against the sanctioned target capacity. Phase-I of the Scheme is now over and no fresh sanction is being issued.Further, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also requested various Union /State Government department to install solar rooftop system in various government offices/buildings. The details of State/UT-wise grid connected rooftop solar power systems reported as installed in Government offices/buildings/institutions etc. as on 20.06.2019 are given in Annexure I.(d) On an average it is estimated that 1.5 million units per MW per year is expected to be generated from solar rooftop plants. The average cost of generation solar power from rooftop plant is around Rs.4/- per unit, and in most of the States the power tariff for Government buildings is more than this. Thus, there has been a substantial saving due to installation of rooftop solar power plants on government buildings.(e) Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) / Agreements with various countries / International Institutions for cooperation in the field of Renewable Energy, which inter alia includes technical cooperation also. The list of MoUs / Agreements signed between MNRE and various countries / International Institutions is placed at Annexure II (attached). *****
