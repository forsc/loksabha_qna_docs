                                                        Minister of AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) &(e):	 Details of beneficiary oriented Schemes being implemented by the Department of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare for economic and social upliftment of the farmers in the country including the state of Bihar are given in Annexure.(b) to (c):	 Agriculture being a State Subject, the State Governments take appropriate measures for development of agriculture in the State. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes/ programmes. The various schemes/ programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of the farmers of the country.(d)  In the year 2013-14, the Budget allocation for Department of Agriculture was only Rs. 21933.50 crore. This has been increased by more than 5.5 times to Rs. 1,23,017.57 crore in 2021-22. Institutional credit for agriculture sector increased from Rs. 7.3 lakh crore in 2013-14 with a target to reach Rs. 16.5 lakh crore in 2021-22. A special drive has been undertaken since February 2020 to provide concessional institutional credit with focus on covering all PM-KISAN beneficiaries through Kisan Credit Cards (KCC). Till date, 260.60 lakh new KCC applications have been sanctioned with a sanction credit limit of Rs. 2,76,780 crore as part of the drive. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to address problems of high premium rates for farmers and reduction in sum insured due to capping. In past 5 years of implementation, 29.39 crore farmers applicants enrolled and over 8.83 crore (Provisional) farmer applicants have received claims of over Rs. 102045 crore. During this period nearly Rs. 21451 crore were paid by farmers as their share of premium against which claims of over Rs.102045 crore (Provisional) have paid to them. A few State Governments provide different relief measures to families of farmers who commit suicide and as per information available, these may inter-alia include; ex-gratia relief to the heirs of the deceased farmer, one time settlement of loans and relief provided to the children to get free education.
