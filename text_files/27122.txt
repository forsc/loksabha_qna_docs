ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (d) Amritsar is located approximately 450 kms from Delhi. It is available as a point of call to foreign carriers of more than 25 countries. Start of direct international flights from Amritsar avoids requirement of people to travel to Delhi airport. Prior to Covid-19 pandemic, Indian carriers were operating direct flights from Amritsar to UK and UAE-Dubai while foreign carriers were operating direct flights to Doha, Tashkent, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.(e) Under the ambit of the bilateral air services agreements concluded by India with foreign countries, Indian designated carriers are free to mount scheduled operations to/from any international airport including Shri Guru Ram Das Ji (SGRDJi) International Airport, Amritsar to foreign destinations.
