                        be pleased to state:-















                                                    (a) whether the  Railways proposes to provide stoppage of important trains like (64160/64589) at Phaphund and Etawah railway stations keeping in view the problems faced by the passengers and villagers of that area; (b) if so, the details thereof; and(c) if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) No, Sir. There is no such proposal at present.(b) Does not arise.(c) Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) Train Number 64160 operates between Agra Cantt and Etawah while MEMU Train Number 64589  operates between Phaphund and Kanpur Central. Stoppage of 64160 Agra Cantt-Etawah MEMU at Phaphund and 64589 Kanpur Central-Phaphund MEMU at Etawah would entail their extensions to Phaphund and Etawah respectively, which is not feasible owing to operational constraints.    *****
