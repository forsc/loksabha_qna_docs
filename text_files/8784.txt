                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Government has been implementing Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme since 2015 to provide soil test based crop-specific nutrient recommendations to all the farmers in the country every 2 years.   The soil samples are collected from a grid size of 2.5 ha in irrigated and 10 ha in unirrigated area. Each sample is tested for 12 parameters. Soil Health Card provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its productivity.  	During the current financial year (2019-20) a pilot project ‘Development of Model Villages’ has been taken up. The programme promotes farm holding based soil sample collection and testing with farmers’ participation.  One village in each block has been selected by the States for implementation of the pilot project.(b):	The scheme is being monitored through weekly video conferencing with all states including Delhi and National Capital Region. 	However, Government of Delhi has not availed any financial assistance from Central Government under the Soil Health Card Scheme.  The   progress of SHC scheme has also been captured on SHC portal https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/ starting from soil sample collection, testing, and card distribution. Regular monitoring is also ensured through   review meetings, field visits etc.   (c):	The operational guidelines have been issued to all State Government and also available at the Departmental & SHC portals.   								 	http://agricoop.nic.in/	https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/*******
