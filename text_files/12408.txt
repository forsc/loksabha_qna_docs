ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a): The amalgamation of Bank of Baroda (BoB), Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank on 1.4.2019 has enabled harnessing of synergy potential across amalgamated banks and economies of scale for the creation of a stronger bank, improved the reach to customers, resulted in a wider array of products and services, and enhanced the bank’s lending capacity. This has yielded benefits in terms of improvement in operating profit, with BoB reporting an operating profit of Rs. 14,571 crore in the first three quarters of the current financial year, representing an increase of 12.8% over the operating profit for the corresponding period in the preceding year. (b) and (c): Pension of nationalised banks is based on consensus arrived at as a result of bipartite negotiations between bank managements and bank employee unions/associations. Employees’ Pension Regulations framed accordingly by bank Boards have been notified by the Government under the provisions of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980. It may thus be seen that pension is currently payable as per the agreement arrived at between bank unions/associations and the banks. PSBs had been requested by the Government to expedite steps for wage revision. The Indian Banks’ Association, which negotiates on behalf of bank managements on the basis of mandates from banks, has informed that negotiations on wage revision are in process. ***
