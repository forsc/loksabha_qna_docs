ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) to (c) Throwball Federation of India (TFI), registered with Registrar of Societies at Bangalore, was granted recognition by the Govt. in 1989. Ever since its recognition there have beenrepresentations filed by another group registered in Haryana claiming to be the genuine Office Bearers of the Federation. On account of the dispute this Ministry stopped granting financial assistance to the federation since February 2008. This Ministry started granting annual recognition to National Sports Federations from the year 2010. The Ministry has not granted recognition to any Sports Federation for the discipline of Throwball since then due to the ongoing disputes. Recently, both the groups were asked to submit relevant documents to the Department for consideration of their claims for Government recognition.(d) & (e) No such orders from any court has been received in this Ministry in the recent past.***
