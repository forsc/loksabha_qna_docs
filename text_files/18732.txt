                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department monitors the prices of both scheduled and non-scheduled formulations on regular basis to check overcharging by pharmaceutical companies. Whenever companies are found to be overcharging the consumer in sale of medicine, NPPA issues notices to the companies.  Till now, NPPA has initiated 2116 number of overcharging cases. At present, 881 numbers of overcharging cases involving a total amount of Rs. 8,184.19 crore under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO), 1979, 1987, 1995 and 2013 are pending. Out of which, an amount of Rs. 6,550.37 crore is under litigation in various Courts in respect of 324 cases. The case wise detailed list alongwith amount involved is available on the website of NPPA, i.e., www.nppaindia.nic.in .(b) to (d):	The action for recovery of the overcharged amount is a continuous on-going process undertaken as per the provisions of DPCOs.  In cases where the demands raised for overcharging have been challenged in courts, the NPPA pursues these cases in the court. In case the demand raised by the NPPA has not been challenged in the court and the concerned company has not deposited the amount, the matter is referred to the respective Collector/District Magistrate for recovery of the overcharged amount as arrears of land revenue under provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. *******
