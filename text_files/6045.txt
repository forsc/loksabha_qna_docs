However, details of the deaths due to shortage of ARV are not available.(c):	 Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken note of the shortage of ARV reported by the States and several meetings were held in the Ministry to review the shortage of ARV reported by the States. The State Governments were requested to provide information on shortage of ARV and assistance needed from the Central Government. Drug Controller General of India was also directed to monitor the pharmaceutical firms producing ARV for ensuring regular supply of ARV to the States. States/UTs have also been advised to use Intradermal Route of ARV and ensure the availability of ARV in all health facilities for management of Animal Bite Victims.
