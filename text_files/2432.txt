ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :  	There has been increase in power generation from conventional fuel sources (except Nuclear) of 25 MW and above plants and from renewable sources in the country during the last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The details of source- wise generation from last three years are given at Annexure-I.(c) to (e) :	As on 31.05.2019, the installed generation capacity was about 357 Giga Watt (GW) which is sufficient to meet the peak power demand of the country.  The maximum peak demand occurred during the current year 2019-20 (upto May, 2019) was around 183 GW which was successfully met. During April-May, 2019 the average power shortage in the country was only around 0.4% and the peak power shortage was only around 0.5%. The state-wise details of power supply position in the country during the last two years and the current year 2019-20 (up to May, 2019) are at Annexure-II. This gap is generally on account of factors like constraints in distribution network, financial constraints to purchase power by Distribution Company etc.(f) & (g) :  	The transmission losses in Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) are in the range of 2.5% to 3% which is for technical reasons. As per the report information submitted by states participating under Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) the Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses, which include theft and pilferage for the year 2017-18 stood at 18.7%. Inspite of the above mentioned losses which includes technical losses inherent to the electrical system, there is practically no gap between supply and demand.To reduce the losses at Distribution level, the Government has launched several schemes such as Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for strengthening the Distribution infrastructure in urban and rural areas respectively. This includes provision of consumer and system metering, star rated transformers, underground cabling and aerial bunched cables. A total of 32 States/ Union Territories and their Power distribution utilities have also signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) under UDAY the main outcome parameters of which is to reduce AT&C loss levels to 15%.****************
