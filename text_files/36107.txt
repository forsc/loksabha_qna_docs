Government of India has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in the primary energy mix from 6.7% to 15 % by 2030. Expanding the city gas distribution network through establishment of CNG stations and providing piped natural gas to households, industries and commercial establishments is one of the strategies for increasing the consumption of natural gas. Establishment of CNG station is a part of development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network and the same is carried out by the entities authorized by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). PNGRB launched the 11th CGD bidding round in August 2021 for development of CGD network in 65 GAs. In conclusion of this round, PNGRB has authorized 40 GAs and issued Letters of Intent (LoI) for 21 GAs. In this round, the Minimum Work Plan (MWP) provides for establishment of 8721 CNG Stations. Later under 11th A CGD bidding round, PNGRB has invited bids for 6 GAs in January/February 2022. The last date of bid submission is 06.04.2022/10.05.2022. CGD network after the 11th and 11th A CGD bidding rounds, shall potentially cover 98% of population and 88% of geographical area of the country.CGD entities set up and operate CNG stations on their own or through dealers of various Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), based on the assigned Minimum Work Programme (MWP), the demand of natural gas in the area and techno-commercial viability. Up to the 10th CGD bidding round, PNGRB had authorized 228 Geographical Areas (GAs) for establishment of 8211 CNG stations as per MWP in various GAs. The number of CNG stations established by various authorized entities has increased from 1,742 on 31.03.2019 to 3,878 on 31.01.2022. The State/UT-wise details of CNG stations are at Annexure. ****
