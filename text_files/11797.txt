                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Airports Authority of India (AAI) has initiated the process for development of Vijayawada Airport which involves construction of Integrated Terminal Building to handle 1200 peak hour passengers along with new apron to park 3 nos. of Code - E type aircraft and allied structures at a cost of Rs. 611.80 crore. The tender for construction of the terminal building has been called. Since the work has not been awarded yet, the question of delay does not arise.; (c): Vijayawada Airport has been declared as an International Airport. However, it has not been granted as a Point of Call for foreign carriers whereas Indian carriers are free to mount operations from any point in India including Vijayawada subject to existing capacity entitlement as per the bilateral Air Service Agreement (ASA) between India and the concerned country. However, airlines operations are always guided by commercial judgment of airlines.;(d): Development of airports is a continuous process. The new Integrated Terminal Building at Vijayawada Airport is expected to cater to traffic requirement till the year 2028.
