                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES               (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (e):  As part of the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a Scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in the year 2015 to promote manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle technology and to ensure sustainable growth of the same. The Phase-I of this Scheme was initially launched for a period of 2 years, commencing from 1st April 2015, which was subsequently extended from time to time and the last extension was allowed up to 31st March 2019.      Based on outcome and experience gained during the Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders including Industry and Industry Associations, the Government notified Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through demand incentives about 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will be also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.In the First Phase of the Scheme about 2.8 lakh hybrid and electric vehicles are supported by way of demand incentive amounting to about Rs 359 crore. Further, DHI sanctioned 425 electric and hybrid buses to various cities in the country with total cost of about 300 Crores. The Department of Heavy Industry has also sanctioned about 500 Charging Stations/ Infrastructure for Rs. 43 Crore (approx.) under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme. Under Phase-II of FAME India Scheme, about 15,800 Electric Vehicles have been supported till 12.03.2020 by way of Demand Incentive. Further, 5595 electrical buses have been sanctioned to various State/ City Transport Undertakings under Phase-II of the Scheme.      The FAME-India Scheme envisages support for setting up of adequate public charging infrastructure to instill confidence among EV users, through active participation and involvement of various stakeholders including Government agencies, industries and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs).Under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme, Department of Heavy Industry sanctioned about 500 Charging Stations/ Infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs). Out of these 500 charging stations 279 charging stations have been installed. In addition, the Department has also sanctioned 2,636 Charging Stations for EVs in 62 cities across 24 States/UTs under FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles in India) scheme phase II.     As per information received from EESL and BHEL, EESL has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) to set up a network of public charging infrastructure for electric mobility at various highways across the country. EESL and BHEL both have taken steps to explore opportunities in the field of E-mobility and development ofthe network of Public Charging Infrastructure for fast-track adoption of EVs in the country.      As per MoU, EESL will make the entire upfront investment on services, along with the operation and maintenance of the public charging infrastructure while BHEL will offer complete EPC solutions from concept to commissioning. The MoU covers collaboration for identifying, planning, development and installation of charging stations at suitable locations.                                *****
