ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)	Under “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)” funds are released in a consolidated manner for the Mission as per extant provisions 	of GFR 2017, which, inter alia, requires submission of utilization certificates by States/UTs. Inter-se allocation of fund for Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH) component is made by States/UTs, as per local requirement, which are spent on new construction, refurbishment and operation and maintenance of shelters. A statement showing state/UTs-wise details of funds released by Government and utilized by the States/ UTs under DAY-NULM during 2014-15 to 2019-20 till date, year-wise is at Annexure-I. (c) to (e)	Hon’ble Supreme Court, vide its Order dated 13.12.2017, had directed to carry out a special audit, of utilization of DAY-NULM funds by the States of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and West Bengal. Internal Audit Wing of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has conducted special audit of three states. It has found out that expenditure, out of the funds transferred by Government of India to these states, has been incurred on various components of DAY-NULM. However, there were unspent balances left with them. These were Rs. 28.67 Crore with Uttar Pradesh, Rs. 32.91 Crore with Haryana and Rs. 6.90 Crore with West Bengal at the time of audit. 	Further, in order to ensure that the funds earmarked by the States/ UTs for SUH are utilized for shelters only, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has issued directions to them to keep the funds for SUH in a separate head of account.                            *****
