                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) & (b):	Initially the project was assigned to Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in 2014 but as the Insured person (IP) strength was less than 50,000, the construction work was not initiated and subsequently withdrawn from CPWD. Later on after tendering in 2016, the ESIC assigned the work to M/s Engineering Projects India Limited (EPIL). As agreement was not signed with EPIL, it was decided to cancel the work order. Now action has been initiated to assign the work to the CPWD. The area now satisfies the 50,000 IP norms.*******
