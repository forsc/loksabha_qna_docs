Till 31st March 2020, 23000 Key Resource Persons and around 17 lakh elementary teachers were trained across states and UTs in face to face mode. 	However, due to COVID-19 challenges and in order to provide continuous learning opportunities to the teachers at the elementary level, this Department has launched NISHTHA online using DIKSHA platform in October 2020 to reach out to elementary teachers and its further extension to all as well. All districts of Gujarat including tribal districts are covered under the NISHTHA scheme.	*****
