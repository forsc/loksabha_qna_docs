                                                        Government does not allocate any funds to set-up any textile industry including spinning factory in any part of the country. However, government has extended financial assistance for upgradation of technology to spinning factories under Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme.  Further, to safeguard the interest of cotton farmers and to give them remunerative price of their produce, Government nominated Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), as nodal agency to undertake Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations of seed cotton (kapas) in all cotton growing States, in the event when prices touches the MSP level.  During the crop year 2018-19, CCI procured 0.25 lakh bales of seed cotton (kapas) under MSP in Odisha state.***
