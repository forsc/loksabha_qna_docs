ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c): With the twin objectives of bringing fresh talent and augmenting the manpower at certain levels in the Central Government, it was decided to undertake lateral recruitment of ten Joint Secretaries and forty Directors/Deputy Secretaries in the identified Ministries/Departments on contract/deputation (including short term contract) basis. Pursuant to this decision, eight Joint Secretaries were appointed during 2019, out of whom seven are in position at present. It is now proposed to fill three posts at Joint Secretary level, twenty seven posts at Director-level and thirteen posts at Deputy Secretary-level through lateral recruitment on contract/deputation (including short term contract) basis. No centralized data on category of persons appointed through lateral recruitment in the Central Government is maintained.Each post being filled is a Single Post in a specific domain area, and the candidates are either to be appointed on contract basis or those from State Governments, Union Territories, Public Sector Undertakings, Autonomous Bodies, Statutory Bodies, Universities etc. on deputation basis (including short term contract), who would retain lien in their parent Departments. As such, there is no question of any reduction in reserved posts for SCs, STs, and OBCs.*****
