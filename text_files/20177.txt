ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): An application from M/s Apple India Limited was received in Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in April, 2015 seeking permission for import of used Apple IPhones and Ipads which are sold as Apple Certified and Pre-owned after repair by the original equipment manufacturer. The matter was discussed in the Technical Review Committee in its 37th meeting held during June, 2015 which deliberated upon the proposal with respect to HW Rules, 2008. The Committee has not recommended import of old consumer electronic items like mobiles, laptops, televisions etc. for the purpose of trading. The Committee noted that the items proposed to be imported are known to have short functional life and are prone to become obsolete and unusable in lesser period of time. Therefore, generation of e-waste would become quicker in the country. The Committee therefore, did not recommend import of such items for trading purpose. (c)  and (d): Import of electronic items in the country is subject to the permission/ registration/authorization under the  following regulations wherever applicable:   (i)  Import Policy: ITC (HS), 2017, Schedule - I (Import Policy)  and Foreign Trade Policy notified by Ministry of Commerce & Industry.(ii) Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012 notified by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. (iii) Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 (HWM Rule) and e-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 notified by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC). (iv)  In addition, as indicated in Para 2.03 of Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-2020, Domestic Laws/Rules/Orders/Regulations/Technical Specifications/Environmental/Safety and health norms applicable to domestically produced goods shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to imports, unless specifically exempted. (e)  Government is promoting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country. The steps taken in these regards are placed at annexure.  ******* Annexure Steps taken by the Government to promote domestic electronics manufacturing  1.  National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.  To attract and incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote exports, following three Schemes have been notified under the aegis of NPE 2019:  (i) Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218990 dated April 01, 2020 shall extend an incentive of 4% to 6% to eligible companies on incremental sales (over base year) involved in mobile phone manufacturing and manufacturing of specified electronic components, including Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units.   (ii) Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218992 dated April 01, 2020 shall provide financial incentive of 25% on capital expenditure for the identified list of electronic goods that comprise downstream value chain of electronic products, i.e., electronic components, semiconductor/ display fabrication units, ATMP units, specialized sub-assemblies and capital goods for manufacture of aforesaid goods.   (iii) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218991 dated April 01, 2020 shall provide support for creation of world class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities, including Ready Built Factory (RBF) sheds / Plug and Play facilities for attracting major global electronics manufacturers along with their supply chain to set up units in the country. The Scheme shall provide financial assistance for setting up of both EMC projects and Common Facility Centres (CFCs) across the country.  2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing (except from countries sharing land border with India), subject to applicable laws/ regulations; security and other conditions. 3.	Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS): The Scheme was notified on 27th July, 2012 to provide financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector. It was amended in August, 2015 to extend the period of the scheme, enhance scope of the Scheme by including 15 more product verticals, and attract more investment. The scheme was further amended in January, 2017 to expedite the investments. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The incentives are available for 44 categories / verticals of electronic products and components covering entire electronics manufacturing value chain. The Scheme was open to receive applications till 31.12.2018 and is in the implementation mode. 4.	Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme: Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme was notified on 22nd October, 2012 to provide support for creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investment. Under the Scheme, 20 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) measuring an area of 3,565 acres with total project cost of INR 3,898 crore including Government Grant-in-Aid of INR 1,577 crore have been approved. 5.	Electronics Development Fund (EDF): Electronics Development Fund (EDF) has been set up as a “Fund of Funds” to participate in professionally managed “Daughter Funds” which in turn will provide risk capital to startups and companies developing new technologies in the area of electronics and Information Technology (IT). This fund is expected to foster R&D and innovation in these technology sectors. INR 409 crore has been committed through EDF to 9 Daughter Funds with a targeted corpus of INR 2,626 crore. 6.	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile handsets and their sub-assemblies / parts manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile handsets has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (CKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition.   7.	Tariff Structure has been rationalized to promote domestic manufacturing of electronic goods, including, inter-alia, Cellular mobile handsets, Televisions, Electronic components, Set Top Boxes for TV, LED products and Medical electronics equipment. 8.	Exemption from Basic Customs Duty on capital goods: Notified capital goods for manufacture of specified electronic goods are permitted for import at “NIL” Basic Customs Duty. 9.	Simplified import of used plant and machinery: The import of used plant and machinery having a residual life of at least 5 years for use by the electronics manufacturing industry has been simplified through the amendment of Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, vide Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Notification dated 11.06.2018. 10.	Relaxing the ageing restriction: The Department of Revenue vide Notification No.60/2018-Customs dated 11.09.2018 has amended the Notification No.158/95-Customs dated 14.11.1995, relaxing the ageing restriction from 3 years to 7 years for specified electronic goods manufactured in India and re-imported into India for repairs or reconditioning. 11.
