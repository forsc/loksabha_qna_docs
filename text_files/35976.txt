ANSWER




ANSWERTHE MINISTER FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING (SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	Animal Husbandryis a State subject and deployment of veterinary manpower for providing treatment of animals is done by the respective States / UTs.The Department supplements the efforts of the States / UTs by providing them financial assistance as well as strategic policy inputs. Further, the Department is responsible for regulating veterinary practice through Veterinary Council of India (VCI) which is mandated to maintain the Indian Veterinary Practitioners’ Register (IVPR) containing names of persons who possess recognized veterinary qualifications (Degree in Veterinary Science & Animal Husbandry). However, the Department does not maintain State / UT-wise details of veterinary doctors and para-veterinarians employed and positions vacant in the States / UTs.(b)	to (e) As per IVPR, there are 73,129registered veterinary practitioners as on 31/3/2020. The State-wise list is given at Annexure I.Veterinary colleges impart the requisite knowledge and skills of veterinary science through their BVSc & AH course which is essential for animal welfare. At present, there are 54 recognized veterinary colleges in India, including 5 (five) in the private sector. A list of such veterinary colleges is at Annexure-II.Animal Husbandry including Veterinary education is a State subject hence, establishment of veterinary colleges is done, after need assessment, by State Governments. VCI issued the Minimum Standards of Veterinary Education (MSVE) Regulations, 2016 to regulate veterinary colleges, whether in private or in public sector. Further, Government, under the Indian Veterinary Council Act1984, has framed the VCI (Procedure for recognition and de-recognition of Veterinary Colleges and Veterinary qualification) Rules 2017 (amended in 2019),towards opening of new veterinary colleges and ensure fulfillment of minimum standards in veterinary education. (f) 	Government, under Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC) scheme, supplements the efforts of States /UTstowards animal health by providing them financial assistance. To bring veterinary services at farmers’ doorsteps, the Central Government, from 2021-22, is providing 100% central funds towards procurement & customization of mobile veterinary units (MVUs). However, recurring operational expenditure would be shared with States in the ratio of 90:10 for North Eastern & Himalayan States; 60% for other States, and 100% for UTs. Government has already released a sum of Rs.681.57 Crore to 33 States/UTs towards procurement & customization of 4332 numbers of Mobile Veterinary Units. In addition, Department also supports proposals from States/ UTs towards establishment and renovation of existing veterinary institutions under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) scheme of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
