ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) : 	Under Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is implementing rehabilitation works of its only three dams namely Konar, Maithon and Panchet (excluding Tilaiya dam). This project consists of three (03) components namely Rehabilitation & Improvement of DVC Dams, Institutional Strengthening and Project Management. The main objective of this project is to enhance the safety of structural / non-structural part of DVC dams and improve their operational performance so that impact of disaster can be mitigated to a great extent. The total installed capacity of DVC in respect of Thermal Power is 7090 MW and Hydel power is 147.2 MW.  Presently DVC does not have any programme for capacity addition.The irrigation potential of Tilaiya Reservoir in Koderma district is 24,670 Hectare Metres. However, at present, water is not being supplied for irrigation purpose to Koderma district from DVC dams because DVC has not received any proposal from Government of Jharkhand for supply of irrigation water to Koderma district. During Financial Year 2019-20 (till October, 2019), a quantity of 0.165 MU power has been generated from the Tilaiya Hydel Power Station (capacity 2x2 MW) located in Koderma district. DVC directly supplies 48 MW power (Thermal and Hydel) from its generation to High Tension (HT) consumers of Koderma district. DVC also supplies 600 MW power from its generation to Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) which in turn serve the consumers of Jharkhand including Koderma district.                                        **************
