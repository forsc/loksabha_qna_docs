ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (c) India ranks second in the global fisheries and the fisheries in India focuses on the sustainable utilization of fisheries resources. The National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017 proposes to keep sustainability of the resources at the core of all actions. The State/Union Territories (UT) Governments are implementing their respective ‘Marine Fishing Regulation Act(s)’ (MFRAs) to ensure sustainable fishing practices. Workshops, meetings and awareness programs are organized from time to time by the Central and State/UT Governments, Coast Guards, Fisheries Research Institutions, Inter-Governmental Organization (IGO), Fisheries Universities & Colleges, other agencies as well as Fishermen Associations/Federations etc. to sensitize the stakeholders including fishermen to spread awareness and to follow sustainable practices in the fisheries to ensure quality.
