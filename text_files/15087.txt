ANSWER




MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 State-wise details of claims paid and number of farmer applicants to whom the claims paid i.e. farmers benefitted in country and in Udaipur district of Rajasthan from Kharif 2016 to Kharif 2019 season under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are given in Annexure-I. (b) to (d):    Government of India constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommended strategies to achieve the same. The Committee submitted it Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress as per these recommendations. To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity, resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers and shift from farm to non-farm occupation.  	Further, Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake implementation of programmes/ schemes for the development of the sector.  Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes/programmes.  These schemes/ programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. A list of initiatives taken by the Government is at Annexure-II. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of the farmers of the country.
