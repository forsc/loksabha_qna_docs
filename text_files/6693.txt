                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) 		Under the District component of Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) Programme implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj from 2006-07 to 2014-15, five (5) districts of Jammu & Kashmir and thirty (30) districts of Madhya Pradesh were covered.  The names of these districts are at Annexure. (b) 		As the BRGF (District component) was under implementation during the period 2006-07 to 2014-15, no fund has been released to the State Governments under this Programme during the last three years and the current year. (c) & (d)	No Sir. Consequent upon the implementation of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, share of States in the net proceeds of the Union taxes has been significantly enhanced from 32% to 42% of the Centre’s net tax receipts. Hence, BRGF Programme has been delinked from the budgetary support of the Central Government since 2015-16. *****
