Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has informed that all along it has been adhering to all such guidelines/amendments/clarifications on “Investment of Surplus Funds by Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)” issued by DPE from time to time.  The first such Guideline was notified vide O.M. No.DPE/14(19)/90-Fin dated 03.01.1992 and subsequently, DPE issued amendments / clarifications from time to time with the prevailing directions prescribed vide DPE OM No.18 (1)/2012-Fin dated 8th May, 2017.  Further, as per the policy/methodology approved by SAIL Board, the investment of surplus fund was done at the highest rate of interest offered by the participating banks.  The outstanding position of deposits was also informed to SAIL Board on a regular basis.(c)&(d): SAIL had dealings with the Scheduled Commercial Banks listed in the 2nd Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act for conducting financial transactions. SAIL had received all its funds and made all the payments through State Bank of India (SBI). Therefore, whereever the funds were transferred for investment, the same were transferred from SBI. Instance-wise details for FY 2011-12 to 2014-15 of such transfers are placed at Annexure IA to ID. The last investment was made by SAIL in March, 2015 which matured in March, 2016. Thereafter, no investment was made as surplus funds were not available with SAIL for investment.(e)	SAIL has further informed that there have been no adverse comments raised by audit (CAG/Statutory Auditors), therefore, no internal inquiry conducted against any officials for diverting the funds to different banks for quid pro quo. ********
