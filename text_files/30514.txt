                                                        (a) & (b) 	Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW) has signed an MoU with Ministry of Civil Aviation for development of Non Scheduled/Scheduled operation of Sea Plane Services within territorial jurisdiction of India under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme.  RCS – UDAN scheme was launched by Ministry of Civil Aviation on 21-10-2016 to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity and make air travel affordable to the masses. It is a demand-driven scheme, wherein airline operators assess the feasibility of operation on a particular route and bid under the scheme. Till date, 28 seaplane routes connecting 14 water aerodromes have been awarded under RCS UDAN. As per the scheme, in addition to Viability Gap Funding, Central Government, State Governments and Airport Operators provide concessions to the Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) which include :-1. Central Government:(i) Excise Duty at the rate of 2% on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) for SAOs at RCS Airports for RCS Flights for a period of three years from the date of notification of this Scheme.(ii) Freedom to enter into code sharing arrangements with domestic as well as International Airlines pursuant to applicable regulations and prevailing air service agreements.2. State Governments at RCS Airports within their States:(i) Reduction of Value Added Tax to 1% or less on ATF at RCS Airports located within the State for a period of ten years from the date of notification of RCS – UDAN. (ii) Provision of security and fire services free of cost at RCS Airports.3. Airport Operators:(i)  Airport operators do not levy Landing Charges and Parking Charges(ii) SAOs are allowed to undertake ground handling for their RCS Flights at all airports.(iii) Airports Authority of India does not levy any Terminal Navigation Landing Charges on RCS Flights.(iv)Route Navigation and Facilitation Charges are levied by Aal on a discounted basis @ 42.50% of Normal Rates on RCS Flights.(c) & (d) 	So far no study on the disruption of aquatic and aerial biodiversity in the lakes has been conducted by Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (MoPSW).  However, MoPSW has mandated Syama Prasad Mookherjee Port, Kolkata to act as nodal agency for conducting Bathymetric Survey, Obstruction Limitation Surface (OLS) Survey and preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) for construction of water aerodrome for sea plane operations.                 *****
