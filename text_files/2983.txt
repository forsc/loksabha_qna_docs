For provision of e-catering services, reputed service providers are also empanelled by IRCTC.       Details of all tenders of IRCTC including the eligibility criteria are available on IRCTC’s website http://www.irctc.com/tenders_En.jsp.(c) to (e): The number of complaints received by the Railways against private catering companies for taking more than the prescribed price and violating the guidelines during the last three years are appended.Since the identity of the catering firms which have indulged in cases of overcharging and other deficiencies in service are clearly known, appropriate penal action is taken, as required, against them without always conducting an enquiry.

The names of the catering firms penalised for deficiency in service will be laid on the Table of the House.        In case any instance of non-compliance of terms and conditions of contract is reported or noticed, strict action is taken against the service providers for deficiency in service. Details of such complaints and action taken can be seen in the appendix.(f):  To provide quality food to passengers, a new Catering Policy has been issued on 27th February 2017 vide which Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has been mandated to carry out unbundling of catering services by creating a distinction between food preparation and food distribution on trains. For this purpose, meals for trains are to be sourced from kitchens owned, operated and managed by IRCTC. Various steps taken to provide quality food to passengers are as follows:I.
