ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) a.	to (d) :  As per information received from Coal India Ltd., theft/pilferage of coal are carried out stealthily and clandestinely. So, it is difficult to assess and specify the exact quantum of coal stolen and losses incurred on account of theft/pilferage. However as per raids conducted by security personnel as well as joint raids with the law and order authorities of the State Government concerned, the quantity of coal recovered and its approximate value [Subsidiary-wise and State-wise] during 2018-19 are as under :-                                                                                                                    (Provisional)Co.
