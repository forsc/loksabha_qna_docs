                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) & (b): The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports does not have any specific programme for Juvenile Delinquents. However, by its various agencies & programmes it helps foster spirit of volunteerism, sportsman spirit and helps in character building of youth.  As per Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government is implementing the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and it is the primary law for children in conflict with law (CCL) and children in need of care and protection (CNCP). Under the Act, a child is defined as a person who has not completed eighteen years of age. The responsibility of implementation of the Act lies with the State Governments and UT Administrations. The JJ Act, focuses on various measures for rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances, including CCL. As per Section 2 (13) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015  (JJ Act), “children in conflict with law (CCL)” means a child who is alleged or found to have committed an offence and who has not completed eighteen years of age on the date of commission of such offence”.

These measures among other things also intend main streaming of CCL and thereby reducing crimes by the minors. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing centrally sponsored scheme i.e. “Child Protection Services” (CPS), for care, protection, rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances including CCL. Under CPS, financial assistance is provided to State Governments/UT Administrations, inter-alia, for undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances including CCL, for setting up and maintenance of various types of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) for providing various rehabilitative services through institutional and non-institutional care.
