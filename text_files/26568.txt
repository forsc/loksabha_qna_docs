The Scheme is implemented in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode. (ii) Another sub-scheme for ‘Promotion’ of Bulk Drug Parks’ aims to bring down the cost of manufacturing of bulk drugs by creating world class common infrastructure facilities. Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided for creation of Common Infrastructure Facilities (CIF) subject to a maximum limit of Rs. 1,000 crore per park or 70% of the project cost of CIF (90% in case of North Eastern States and Hilly States), whichever is less. The Scheme is to be implemented through State Implementing Agency (SIA) set up by the State Government to implement the Project.(iii) Another sub-scheme, namely ‘Production Link Incentive (PLI) scheme for promoting Domestic Manufacturing of Critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (Dis)/Active pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs) in India’ has been launched to attain self-reliance and reduce import dependence in critical KSMs/DIs/APIs. Under the Scheme, financial incentives are provided to the selected applicants on incremental sales over the base year for a period of 6 years. On appraisal of the applications received, in total 43 projects have been approved under the scheme, which will result in committed investment of about Rs. 4425.13 cr.
