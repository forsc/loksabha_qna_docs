ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)	The State-wise number and details of the Steel plants established by the Government and other enterprises in the country at present are given at Annexure.(b)	There is no such proposal under consideration of the Government. (c)	Does not arise in view of (b) above.(d)&(e): No, Sir.  However, to promote a Steel SPV in the state of Jharkhand, an MoU between Ministry of Steel, Government of Jharkhand and NMDC was signed on 28th June, 2015.  Owing to non-allocation of captive iron ore mining lease by the State Government, the steel plant could not be set up.********
