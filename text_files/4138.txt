ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b):  Department is implementing a Scheme on “End-to-end Computerization of TPDS Operations” in collaboration with all States/UTs on cost sharing basis. The Scheme comprises activities, namely, digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms. The Digitization of ration cards/ beneficiaries data has been completed in all 36 States & UTs and digitized details of Ration Cards are available on transparency portals of States/UTs. Apart from the above, in order to identify and weed-out duplicate/ineligible beneficiaries from the TPDS, and to enable better targeting of food subsidies – States/UTs have been asked to seed the Aadhaar number in ration cards/beneficiaries database. At present, 85.5% Ration Cards (at least one member of family) are seeded with Aadhaar number. The bogus ration cards have been identified/detected due to digitisation of ration cards, de-duplication due to seeding of Aadhaar numbers in digitised PDS database, apart from adoption of other means such as detection of in-eligible beneficiaries/families, transfer/migration of families, death(s), change in the economic status of the household etc and has resulted in the deletion/cancellation of ghost/in-eligible ration cards. As per the information, a total of 2.98 crore ration cards stand deleted/cancelled by States/UTs during 2013-18.(c):  	The details of ration cards issued, linked with Aadhaar and found bogus in respect of State of Maharashtra is at Annexure.***ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3830 DUE FOR ANSEWERED ON 16.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.Status of ration cards issued, linked with Aadhaar and Deleted/cancelled ration cards in the State of MaharashtraSl.
