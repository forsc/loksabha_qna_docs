                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	A product is allowed to be exported as “Organic Product” only when accompanied by a Transaction Certificate issued by a Certification Body accredited by National Accreditation Body (NAB) for organic products under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) of the Department of Commerce. ‘Organic Products” for export will be so certified only if produced, processed and packed as per the standards laid down in NPOP.(b)	Region-wise data is not maintained. The State/UT-wise details of the organic agri-products exported from the country  during 2018-19 are at Annexure-I. (c) 	The promotion of exports of organic products is a continuous process. The Agriculture Export Policy provides that no restrictions will be placed on export of organic products.

APEDA provides assistance to the exporters of organic products under various components of its export promotion scheme. APEDA also undertakes various activities to promote exports of organic products viz. addition of new products under NPOP, making efforts to get NPOP standards recognized by the importing countries, promoting ‘India Organic’ brand through participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions, organising Buyer-Seller Meets (BSMs), organising capacity building and outreach programmes etc. ************Annexure-IExport of Organic Products (2018-19)S.
