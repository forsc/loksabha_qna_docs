ANSWER




(a) & (b)    The estimated number of underweight, malnourished and severely malnourished children under 5 years of age is obtained under National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. As per the recent report of NFHS-5 (2019-21), the nutrition indicators for children under 5 years have improved as compared with NFHS-4 (2015-16). Stunting has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, while Wasting has reduced from 21.0% to 19.3% and Underweight prevalence has reduced from 35.8% to 32.1%. (c) to (f)            Mission Poshan 2.0, an integrated nutrition support programme has been announced in budget 2021-2022 for all States/UTs. It seeks to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under Poshan Tracker to improve governance. States/UTs have been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi Centres to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. The details of funds allocated to State/UTs and expenditure under the POSHAN Abhiyaan since its inception is at Annexure-I. **********    Annexure-I State/UT-wise details of funds released and utilised from F.Y. 2018-19 to 2020-21 under POSHAN Abhiyaan  Amount in ? lakhs SN	State/UT	Total Central Funds released from 2018-19 to 2020-21 	Total Central Funds utilization as on 31st March 20211	Andaman & Nicobar Islands	936.25	421.442	Andhra Pradesh	25363.32	16601.843	Arunachal Pradesh	2815.88	708.114	Assam	32948.67	18117.525	Bihar	49365.6	27823.996	Chandigarh	1099.87	513.967	Chhattisgarh	12137.21	6505.258	Dadra Nagar Haveli and 	774.31	682.98	Daman & Diu	686.7	9	Delhi	3327.18	2432.5810	Goa	456.04	222.2411	Gujarat	29976.16	21769.0112	Haryana	6808.82	432613	Himachal Pradesh	10973.21	7010.7814	Jammu & Kashmir	9178.53	7912.0915	Jharkhand	8154.95	5245.9316	Karnataka	14276.52	11133.4217	Kerala	10974.73	6696.5118	Ladakh	164.59	51.4119	Lakshadweep	427.36	287.2720	Madhya Pradesh	39398.53	18516.8321	Maharashtra	58390.84	40154.522	Manipur	4389.99	2138.423	Meghalaya	5073.39	4979.0524	Mizoram	2732.96	2575.0325	Nagaland	5327.67	5239.2626	Odisha	16358.58	7555.6927	Puducherry	943.62	264.5828	Punjab	7346.86	2470.0429	Rajasthan	23830.57	10349.7930	Sikkim	1370.99	1276.8331	Tamil Nadu	25931.46	19476.8532	Telangana	17906.84	14824.3333	Tripura	4135.95	3155.1334	Uttar Pradesh	56968.96	19219.2835	Uttarakhand	13574.89	789836	West Bengal	26751.08	0Total	531279.08	298555.92
