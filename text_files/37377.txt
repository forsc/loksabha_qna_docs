The Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) aims to provide financial assistance to startups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry and commercialization. This would enables these startups to graduate to a level where they will be able to raise investments from angel investors or venture capitalists or seek loans from commercial banks or financial institutions. The funds under the Scheme are released to startups through approved incubators. Rs. 945 crore has been allocated under the Scheme for period of 4 years starting from 2021-22.

The above mentioned schemes have well defined guidelines and institutional framework which include eligibility criteria, selection process, and evaluation committees comprising of subject matter experts from the ecosystem and monitoring mechanisms.  In addition to the above, the Government has taken several measures under Startup India initiative to develop and promote startup ecosystem in the country. The details of measures taken by the government to help the startups grow in the country are at Annexure III.  ******
