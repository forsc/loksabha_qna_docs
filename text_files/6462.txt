Transformative reforms such as governance, academic,affiliation and accreditation reforms are pre-requisites in the implementation of thescheme in the States. All the funding under RUSA is norm based and future grants areperformance based and outcome dependent.The RUSA Scheme has been instrumental in improving the access and equity inhigher education.
