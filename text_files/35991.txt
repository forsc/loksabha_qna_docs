                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 290 BY SHRI BHAGIRATH CHOUDHARY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 23.03.2022 REGARDING ESCALATORS AND LIFTS AT KISHANGARH RAILWAY STATION.(a) and (b): Two (2) number of escalators and one lift were sanctioned for Kishangarh Railway station in budget year 2018-19. However, there was revision in the policy of provision of escalators at Railway stations issued on 06.03.2019, as per which minimum required footfall for provision of escalator at Railway Station is 25,000 per day. Since, footfall of Kishangarh railway station was less than 25,000 per day, therefore, it did not qualify for provision of escalators. Consequently, the escalators sanctioned for Kishangarh railway station were transferred to other qualified Railway station.(c) and (d):  As per policy, minimum required footfall for provision of escalators at Railway Station is 25,000 per day. Hence, Kishangarh railway station does not qualify for provision of escalators at this stage. However, one (1) lift is sanctioned for Kishangarh Railway station.*****
