ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	AIR has installed 35 DRM transmitters in MW Band & 3 DRM transmitters in SW Band in 16 States and 1 Union Territory across the country. The scheme for replacement of 35 MW & 3 SW transmitters by DRM transmitters was approved in April 2010 under 11th Plan. Under the Plan, only those MW & SW transmitters which had completed useful service life and were having poor performance at that time in 2009-2010 were identified for replacement. (b) and (c)		Testing is currently underway to evaluate latest Digital Terrestrial Radio Technologies/ Standards that are both backward compatible and ubiquitously available as well as in line with emerging standards such as 5G Direct to Mobile Broadcasting. Roadmap for further digitalization of terrestrial radio services will be based on evaluation of these latest technologies and their viability. AIR Kozhikode Medium Wave transmitter has outlived its useful lifespan and is functioning on reduced power. AIR''s FM transmitters at 14 places viz. Alappuzha, Kannur, Coimbatore, Kalpetta, Kasargod, Kavaratti, Kochi, Kozhikode, Mangalore, Manjeri, Mercara, Mysore, Ooty and Trichur are also covering about 87% coverage area of MW transmitter at Kozhikode. In addition to this, AIR services including those from Kerala are available all over India on DD Free Dish DTH and “NewsOnAir” App on Android and iOS Platforms. ******
