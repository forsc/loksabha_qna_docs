ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR )(a):   As such, there is no harmful effect of chemical fertilizers and insecticides with balanced and judicious use as per recommendation.  However, imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers coupled with low addition of organic matter over years may cause multi-nutrient deficiencies in soil. There is also possibility of nitrate contamination in groundwater above the permissible limit of 10 mg NO3-N/L due to excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers particularly in light textured soils.   (b) & (c):   Government of India has been promoting production and use of bio-fertilizers under various schemes/ programmes given below:•	Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme (CISS): Credit linked back ended subsidy is provided to individuals/ private agencies through NABARD for setting up of Bio-fertilizer production units @ 25% of cost limited to Rs.40 lakhs /unit.   State and Central Government agencies are provided 100% assistance with maximum limit of Rs 160.00 lakh per unit of 200 Ton Per Annum (TPA) capacity.•	 Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY):   Assistance of Rs. 31,000/ ha/3 years   is provided to the farmers directly through DBT, for inputs including bio-fertilizers, bio pesticides, vermi-compost, botanical extracts etc•	Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region	 (MOVCDNER): Farmers are given assistance of Rs15000/ ha/ 3 years for both on-farm & off-farm organic input.•	National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP): Financial assistance@ 50% subsidy to the tune of Rs. 300/- per ha is being provided for different components including bio-fertilizers, supply of Rhizobium culture/Phosphate Solubilising Bacteria (PSB)/ Zinc Solubilising Bacteria(ZSB)/ Azatobacter/ Mycorrhiza and vermi compost.•	National Food Security Mission (NFSM): Under NFSM, financial assistance is provided for promotion of Bio-Fertilizer (Rhizobium/ PSB) @50% of the cost limited to Rs.300 per ha.•	Network project on Soil biodiversity- Bio-fertilizers: The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) under Network project on Soil biodiversity- Bio-fertilizers has developed improved and efficient strains of bio-fertilizers and tested on different crops and soil types to promote use of bio-fertilizers.      (d):      The study   of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) - “Network project on soil biodiversity- bio fertilizers” indicates that bio-fertilizers can improve crop yields by 10-25% and supplement costly chemical fertilizer (N, P) by nearly 20-25% in most of the cases when used along with the chemical fertilizers. Bio-fertilizers when applied along with compost @ 5t/ha or vermi-compost @ 2t/ha, fertilizer saving is almost 50%.******
