ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (f) : ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible  for prevention,  detection,  registration  and   investigation of --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 2530 FOR 09.07.2019crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. An advisory dated 04.07.2018 on the issue of incidents of lynching of persons by mobs in some States, fuelled by rumours of lifting/kidnapping of children was issued to the States and UTs to keep watch on circulation of fake news and rumours having potential for violence, and take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands. Further, advisories dated 23.07.2018 and 25.09.2018 were issued to the State Governments/UT Administrations for taking measures to curb incidents of mob lynching in the country. The Government through audio-visual media has also generated public awareness to curb the menace of mob lynching. The Government has also sensitized the service providers to take steps to check the propagation of false news and rumours having potential to incite mob violence and lynching. ********
