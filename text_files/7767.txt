ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)______________________________________________________________________________(a) 	In order to evolve a shared vision of national development priorities, sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States in the light of national objectives, Government of India has replaced Planning Commission with NITI Aayog with effect from January 1, 2015.  As a dedicated think-tank of the Government, NITI Aayog is expected to carry out a directional role, strategically charting the future of the nation. It is expected to provide specialised inputs – strategic, functional and technical to the Government (Centre as well as States), on matters critical to fulfilment of the national development agenda. Besides, NITI Aayog is envisaged to play an important role in monitoring the implementation of policies and programmes, and evaluate their impact.  (b) 	NITI Aayog has been providing directional and policy inputs to Central Ministries/ Departments and State Governments across the range of sectors such as agriculture, science & technology, education, healthcare, water resources, urbanization, energy, transport, and so on.  The attempt is to bring innovation, technology, enterprise and efficient management together at the core of policy formulation and implementation.  It is fostering cooperative federalism through structured support and policy guidance to the States on a continuous basis.  The Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework developed by NITI Aayog has created a paradigm shift from outlays to outcome based governance for improved evidence-based policy-making. In order to promote competitive federalism, NITI Aayog has launched a number of indices for ranking the States on parameters such as school education, health, composite water management, sustainable development goals, etc.  It is steering the ‘Aspirational Districts Programme’ with the objective to develop 112 under-developed districts in the country by focusing on governance and achieving effective convergence among Government agencies and organizations on the ground. The ‘Atal Innovation Mission’ is a flagship initiative to promote innovation and entrepreneurship across the country through Atal Tinkering Labs and Incubation Centres. NITI Aayog has also come out with Strategy for New India @75 document with policy recommendations in 41 key areas with drivers of growth, infrastructure, inclusion and governance.  In performance of its integrated role in the development of a shared vision of national priorities and strategies, NITI Aayog actively engages with States, civil society and other think tanks.(c) 	There is no such proposal under consideration as at present.*****
