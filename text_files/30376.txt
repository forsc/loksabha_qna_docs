                                                    (a) 	whether the efficiency of Government controlled thermal and hydro power plants has reduced substantially because of lack of proper maintenance and timely upgradation of machines and tools resulting in static or reduced power generation;(b) 	if so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor with respect to each of the power plants under the control of the Government;(c) 	whether the Government has formulated any programme to upgrade such thermal and hydro power plants;(d) 	if so, the details thereof; and(e) 	the time by which the said programme is likely to be implemented?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	No, Sir.  There is no report indicating reduction in efficiency of Central Government controlled power plants due to lack of proper maintenance and timely upgradation of machines and tools resulting in static or reduced power generation. However, sometimes efficiency of some of the plants decreases marginally due to factors like coal quality, part load operation, unprecedented low discharges in the river, less rainfall and snowfall in the catchment area of rain fed areas and snow fed areas etc. (c) to (e) :	In addition to regular maintenance activities, various Renovation & Modernisation (R&M) activities are undertaken in older units to enhance the useful life of the plant and introduce new technologies for efficiency improvement, operational flexibility, reliability, interchangeability, and safety.  In case of Hydro Power Stations, as per provisions of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), Renovation & Modernisation (R&M) is taken up after completion of their useful life.**********
