ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): In order to prevent drop outs, lower enrolments and loss of learning, the Ministry of Education has issued guidelines for identification, smooth admission process and continued education of migrant children on 13th July, 2020, inter-alia, requesting the States to identify and enrol all such children without any procedural formalities and maintain a database of children so admitted.Further, to ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, the Department of School Education has shared guidelines dated 7th January, 2021 with all States which, among others, include identification of out of school children from age 6-18 years, enrolment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued Education for children with Special Needs (CWSN), student support on school reopening and Teacher capacity building.Also, a comprehensive Covid action plan has been shared with the States and UTs on 4th May 2021, outlining the role of local bodies, formation of nodal group at village/town level, conducting door-to-door/helpdesk-based/app based survey to identify out of school children, their mainstreaming and resource sharing.(c) & (d): This Department has developed an online module for compiling the data of Out of School Children (OoSC) identified by each State/UT and their mapping with Special Training Centres (STC) on the PRABANDH Portal (http://samagrashiksha.in). The concerned State/UT validates the child wise information of the identified OoSC and STC uploaded by the concerned Block Resource Centre of the State for monitoring the progress of mainstreaming of OoSC.(e): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, mandates the appropriate Government to provide free and compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighbourhood school. Further, Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the jurisdiction of the State Governments. Thus, the matter relating to fees and its components in schools are regulated in terms of Rules and Instructions of the respective State/UT Government concerned.****
