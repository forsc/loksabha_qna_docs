                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): State Government has initiated discussions with Government of India for development of  Airport at Ayodhya. At present, Airports Authority of India (AAI) is in receipt of a proposal from State Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) indicating that the State Government will develop the existing airstrip through State Construction and Designed Services (UP Jal Board) under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN. ;Gorakhpur Airport is a civil enclave and AAI maintains the terminal building. In August 2017 GoUP requested for development/ upgradation of Gorakhpur Airport to International Standards. Based on the request of GoUP, AAI requested GoUP to provide 60 acres of land so that existing airport at Gorakhpur could be developed as International Airport. However, GoUP informed that acquisition of requested land would not be possible as the said land is forest land.
