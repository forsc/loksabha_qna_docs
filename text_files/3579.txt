ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)		The Ministry has formulated a National Action Plan on Forest Fire based on the recommendations of a study on Situation Analysis of Forest Fire in India conducted by the Ministry in collaboration with the World Bank and in consultation with all the State Forest Departments including Uttarakhand and other stakeholders. The objective of this plan is to minimize forest fires by informing, enabling and empowering Forest Fringe communities and incentivizing them to work in tandem with the Forest Departments. This will substantially reduce the vulnerability of forests across the diverse forest ecosystems in the country against fire hazards, enhance the capabilities of forest personnel and institutions in fighting fires, and speed up recovery after a fire event.Since forests are managed by the State Forest Departments, the responsibility of forest fire prevention and management lies primarily with the respective State Governments. Ministry supports the efforts of State/Union Territory Governments in prevention and control of forest fire by providing financial assistance for various forest fire prevention and management measures under the Centrally Sponsored Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme. A sum of  Rs.125 Crore (Rupees one hundred twenty-five Crore) has been released to States in last three years under this scheme. (b)	Incidences of damage to horticulture and agriculture products by wild animals in the hilly district of Uttarakhand have been reported from time to time. Details of crop damages due to wild animals in Uttarakhand in the last three years is given below: -S.N	Year (As reported by Uttarakhand Forest Department)	Crop damage (in ha)1	2016-17 	486.3482	2017-18	270.7643	2018-19	242.5784	2019-20 till May 2019	29.079According to the State Forest Department Uttarakhand, information regarding migration of small farmers due to man-animal conflict is not available with the State Forest Department.(c)&(d)	The Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change is not formulating any such policy/action plan. However, the State Forest Department of Uttarakhand has formulated Man-Animal Conflict Rules compensation distribution rules which contain provisions for payment of compensation in case of loss of life and property and damage to crops caused by wild animals.***
