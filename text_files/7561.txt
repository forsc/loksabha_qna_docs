ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e)		 Pradhan Mantri Yuva Yojana (PM-YUVA) was launched by the Ministry during 2016 -17 with a view to creating an enabling eco-system for entrepreneurship promotion among youth through entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy and easy access to entrepreneurship support network and promotion of social entrepreneurship. The Scheme was implemented through the National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD) for which an amount of Rs.18.80 crores had been released. The knowledge partner of the Scheme i.e. Wadhwani Operating Foundation (WOF) with whom an MOU was signed to provide teaching and learning materials for the education and training, defaulted in giving timely delivery. Therefore the Ministry was forced to terminate the Scheme and an amount of Rs. 18.20 crores remained unutilized with NIESBUD. 	A Request for Proposal (RFP) was floated in August, 2016 to empanel Institutes of Higher Learning (Colleges, Universities, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) Institutions including Polytechnics), Schools (10+2), Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Entrepreneurship Development Centres (EDCs), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) training partners, National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD), Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE) and Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII) partner institutions and EDCs of State Governments (EDI of State Governments and those of State Chambers of Commerce & Industry) for implementing PM-YUVA. Private sector Institutes were selected on the basis of a due diligence process by the Quality Council of India (QCI). A total of 69.03 lakhs candidates including 8,646 candidates from Satna District of Madhya Pradesh have been trained under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana of Skill India Mission. So far as training of farmers is concerned, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has been implementing a number of Schemes and 21,162 candidates under National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) and 14,687 under Skill Training of Rural Youths (STRY) have been trained during the year 2016-17 to 2019-20 (upto October, 2019).
