                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)&(b): Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) derives its mandate from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005. The core objectives of the Scheme shall be the following:-a)	Providing not less than one hundred days of unskilled manual work as a guaranteed employment in a financial year to every household in rural areas as per demand, resulting in creation of productive assets of prescribed quality and durability;b)	Strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor;  c)	Proactively ensuring social inclusion; andd)	Strengthening Panchayat Raj institutions:Provided that the said objectives are applicable where the adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work subject to the conditions laid down by or under this Act and in the scheme.Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, focus is given on creation of productive assets of prescribed quality and durability. To ensure the durability of the assets, for all works taken up under the Scheme, by the Gram Panchayat and other implementing agencies, the cost of the material component including the wages of the skilled and semi-skilled workers, can be upto forty percent at the district level.The durability and productivity of assets constructed is specified under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS so that livelihood security of the people is ensured. Para 7.12.2 of Annual Master Circular 2020-21 mentions the desired durability and outcome/productivity of works and same is given at Annexure. During FY 2020-21, more than 363 crore person-days have been generated as on 12.03.2021 which is approximately 40% more than the employment generated during the same period in FY 2019-20. The Government is committed to providing to unskilled manual work to every household whose adult member volunteers to do such work.  Fund release to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work.  The Ministry seeks additional funds from Ministry of Finance as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground. *******
