The PMAY(U) projects timelines vary depending on factors like local statutory compliances for construction, building plan/layout, environmental clearances, coastal area restrictions, defence clearances; arrangement of funds by beneficiaries; tendering process; provision of requisite infrastructure such as water supply, sewerage, approach roads before start of construction in projects; availability of construction materials / labours; climate related hazards such as floods, water logging, incessant rain, extreme cold/hot weather, etc. The mission’s strategy is to complete all projects by March, 2022.                                           ****
