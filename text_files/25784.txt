                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, normal international travel services remain suspended.  International air travel to and from India is taking place through special arrangements, including air bubbles and the Vande Bharat Mission. The protocol for international travel varies from country to country and is based on their evolving pandemic situation.  India has also instituted, since March 2020, certain restrictions on travellers entering India.Some countries have placed a ban on the entry of Indian nationals. Even these countries have made provisions for exemption from the ban for certain categories. However, currently, most countries do not have restrictions imposed on travel of Indian nationals but require a negative COVID-19 report, along with compliance with other country-specific COVID protocols.***
