                                                                                         ANSWER                   MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT                               (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a): The salient features of watershed projects implemented by Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development inter-alia are as under:i.

(b)to(d): The Department of Land Resources (DoLR) was earlier implementing three area development programmes namely Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP) on watershed basis.These three programmes were integrated and consolidated into a single modified programme called the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) with effect from 26.02.2009 which was later amalgamated in PMKSY in 2015-16and named as the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY).Under IWMP, 8214 projects were sanctioned in the country upto 2014-15, of which 1186 were sanctioned in Maharashtra. The district wise details of projects sanctioned and completed under WDC-PMKSY in Maharashtra are given as Annexure.Keeping focus on the completion of the sanctioned projects, Government has not sanctioned any new watershed project under WDC-PMKSY from 2015-16 onwards in the country including Maharashtra. 	As per the decision at highest level, 1832 projects were transferred to States /UTs in 2018, for implementation with their own resources / budget, which included 162 projects in Maharashtra. Therefore, DoLR has been funding implementation of only 1024 projects in the State. WDC-PMKSY aims for developing rainfed and degraded land in the country.
