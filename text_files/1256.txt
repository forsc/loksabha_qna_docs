Ease of funding, speed of delivery, attractive fellowships, access to best research infrastructure and knowledge resource pool, recognition and mentoring in some schemes are some of the characteristics of the young scientist research programmes. The schemes are designed to identify promising young researchers and provide them with training and research opportunities in areas of science, engineering and mathematics. The schemes also provide them a platform to develop as independent researchers for taking up challenging research problems for the benefit of the country. The funds allocated exclusively for young scientist research programmes during 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and the current year by the Ministry of Science and Technology are Rs. 1163.6 crore, Rs. 1182.5 crore, Rs. 1283 crore and Rs. 839.4 crore respectively.(c)	The required age limit for availing the benefits from the following popular young scientist schemes are given below:Scheme / Programme	Age group: Upper age limit ofINSPIRE Faculty Fellow Scheme (DST)	32 years with relaxation of three years to applicants belonging to SC/ST categoriesNational Postdoctoral Fellowship (SERB)	35 years with relaxation of five years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesEarly Career Research Award (SERB)	37 years with relaxation of three years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesRamanujan Fellowship (SERB)	45 yearsTeacher Associateship for Research Excellence (SERB)	45 years with relaxation of five years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesCSIR Fellowship Schemes	35 yearsRamalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship (DBT)	45 yearsInnovative Young Biotechnologist Award(DBT)	35 years of age with relaxations of 5 years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesNational Women Bioscientist Award (DBT)	45 yearsA number of quality publications in high impact journals and patents have emanated from the Young Scientist’s projects.
