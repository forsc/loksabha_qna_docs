                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	to (b) Siltation in the rivers and water bodies may affect the percolation of water and recharge of ground water. However, ground water levels mainly decline because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility. However, the Central Government has taken up important long term policy initiatives for conservation of ground water and rain water harvesting to recharge ground water in order to control depletion of ground water level in the country which are available at http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdfCentral Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC) and PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop. Under these Schemes, 17,56,207 water conservation and recharging structures have been constructed at an expenditure of Rs. 23,435.67 crore in the last three years. The details of works taken up under MGNREGS in the district of Sitamarhi in the State of Bihar during 2018-19 are as under:Renovation of traditional water bodies	Water Conservation and Water HarvestingCompleted & Spillover works PHY.
