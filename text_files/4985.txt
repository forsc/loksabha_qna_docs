                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO THE PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 414 RAISED BY SHRI GAURAV GOGOI, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, TO BE ANSWERED ON 22.7.2019 REGARDING NORMS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF JNVs(a):	The objectives of the Navodaya Vidyalayas Scheme are:(i)	to provide good quality modern education - including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education - to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas, without regard to their family’s socio-economic condition.(ii)	 to ensure that all students of Navodaya Vidyalayas attain a reasonable level of competence in three languages as envisaged in three language formula; and to serve, in each district, as focal points for improvements in quality of school education in general through sharing of experiences and facilities.(b):	The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. At present, there is no proposal under consideration to open new JNVs in Assam to cater to the educational needs of Tea Garden workers.(c):	 Does not arise.(d):	 All the districts of the country including the districts of the state of Assam, which were in existence as on 31.5.2014, have been covered under the scheme (except districts in the state of Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the scheme).*****
