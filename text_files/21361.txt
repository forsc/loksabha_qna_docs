Year wise number of wireless subscribers are as under:<pre>Year (as on)	Number of Wireless subscribersDecember, 2016	9,67,87,880December, 2017	10,79,15,331December, 2018	11,43,72,457December, 2019	11,81,16,323December, 2020	11,87,09,591</pre>(c)	BSNL has reported that it is providing 4G services on a limited scale (at few locations) using its existing spectrum for 3G services. A total 8,637 Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) of 4G are working in the BSNL network.The Government has approved administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services to BSNL. BSNL has floated an Expression of Interest (EOI) on 01.01.2021 for prior registration/Proof of Concept (PoC) from Indian Companies interested in participating in BSNL’s upcoming 4G tender.(d)	The Government approved revival plan for BSNL on 23.10.2019. The revival plan inter-alia includes the measures to reduce the Staff cost through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), administrative allotment of Spectrum through budgetary allocation for providing 4G services, monetisation of assets to generate resources for retiring Debt, CAPEX and other requirements and debt restructuring by raising of Sovereign Guarantee Bonds.(e)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of telecom service providers including BSNL against the benchmark for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs).  Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in India are required to ensure that the call-drop rate in their mobile networks remains within the benchmarks laid down by TRAI.Wherever the benchmark is not met by TSPs, the explanation of the service provider is called for and after considering the explanation submitted by service providers in this regard, TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark.BSNL has informed that it is meeting majority of the QoS parameters fixed by TRAI for both Landline and Mobile subscribers in almost all the Circles.The steps taken by BSNL for improving its mobile services are as follows:i) 	It regularly conducts Drive tests/ Inter Circle Network audit/ surprise checks and optimizes its network for improving its Services.ii)	It is augmenting its Mobile Network progressively by carrying out expansion of Mobile Network in various phases to enhance coverage/ capacity of Mobile network depending on techno-commercial viability and availability of funds.iii)	It continuously monitors the Call drop related problem in its network for better performance.************
