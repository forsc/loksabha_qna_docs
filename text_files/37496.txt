                                                              MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND                 ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) and (b) Yes, Sir. Provision of stoppage of a train at a station is dependent on factors like operational feasibility, traffic pattern and commercial justification.

(c) to (e) At present, Jimidipeta, Bissamcuttack, Therubali and Rayagada stations are being served by 3 pairs, 3 pairs, 2 pairs and 23 pairs of train services, respectively.  Further, 2 pairs of train services have scheduled stoppage at Laxmipur Road, which are not in operation, at present.  Besides, provision of stoppages is an ongoing process subject to operational feasibility, commercial viability etc.*****
