ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (d):    PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing scheme, in which the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal.   The financial implication has been estimated on the basis of operational land holdings data as per Agri – Census Data 2015-16 extrapolated to 2018-19. The Census Data does not take care of joint land holdings. Therefore, there may be increase/decrease in number of beneficiaries from States as the onus lies with the State/UTs Governments to identify the beneficiaries and upload their details thereof on PM-KISAN portal.   Therefore, the actual utilization of the funds may vary depending upon the variation in the number of beneficiaries.  The actual fund position shall be ascertained by reconciliation after the end of the FY 2019-20.   So far, out of an allocated amount of Rs.75,000 crore for the FY 2019-20, an amount of Rs.27,937.26 crore has been spent upto 30-10-2019, which includes administrative expenses also.  ********
