ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  to (c)   Rivers in the country are polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution and other non-point sources of pollution.  Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs, Local Bodies and industrial units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents in sewage treatment plants (STPs)/effluent treatment plants (ETPs) to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation/rejuvenation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for Ganga and its tributaries and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Setting up of STPs is one of the important components of these programmes. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore.Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) programme of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 883 sewerage & septage management projects amounting to Rs.34,081 crore have been taken up, of which 370 projects costing Rs.8,258 crore have been completed so far. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) 2.0 launched in October, 2021, Rs.15883 crore has been allocated to States/UTs for wastewater/used water management, including setting up of STPs and FSTPs (fecal sludge treatment plants).As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans, including installation of wastewater treatment plants, for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.*****
