                                                        ?????? ?????? (??????? ?????? ?????? ?????)MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):	The number of jute mills closed as on 30th November, 2019 stands at 23, out of which there are 5 in Andhra Pradesh, 2 in Bihar, 1 in Chattisgarh, 1 in Odisha, 2 in Uttar Pradesh and 12 in West Bengal. Most of the Jute Mills are under Private Management. Closing and reopening of jute mills is a cyclical process which depends on various factors of production such as low productivity, labour dispute, raw material supply, fall in material demand etc. For strengthening the jute sector, the Centre Government has been taking a number of measures for supporting the jute manufacturing units which include:-(i)	Creation of consistent demand for jute mills under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) [JPM Act], 1987. At present, 100% of food grains and a minimum of 20% of sugar are to be compulsorily packed in jute sacking. (ii)	Implementation of Incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Plants and Machinery (ISAPM) for Jute Industry and Jute Diversified Products Manufacturing Units to facilitate modernization and up-gradation in existing and new jute mills/JDP units by way of capital subsidy. (iii)	Imposition of Anti-Dumping Duty on jute goods originating from Bangladesh and Nepal to protect domestic jute industry.*****
