ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  Irrigation projects are planned, implemented and managed by the concerned State Governments, as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support, and partial financial support in some cases, as per the norms of the existing schemes being implemented by Government of India.  However, for the Major and Medium Irrigation projects on inter-state river systems, techno-economic viability is to be appraised by Central Water Commission (CWC) under Ministry of Jal Shakti. Further, appraisal of minor irrigation schemes is being done by the State Government itself.            At present, four medium irrigation projects, including one from Chhattisgarh, are under appraisal in CWC. Details in this regard are as below:No.	Title of Project	State	Cultivable Command Area (Hectare) 	Estimated CostRs. in Crore1	Attapady Irrigation Project- Detailed Project Report	Kerala	6,500	497.00 (2018-19 Price Level [PL])2	Bordi Nalla Medium Irrigation Project- Pre-Feasibility Report	Maharashtra	4,649	515.96 (2016-17 PL)3	Katepurna Barrage Medium Irrigation Project  - Pre- Feasibility Report	Maharashtra	4,356	533.81 (2017-18 PL)4	Kolbirra Medium Tank Project- Pre-Feasibility Report	Chhattisgarh	3,500	164.25 (2018-19 PL) Contd…P/2//2// (c)  During current financial year, one medium irrigation project, namely Amreng Irrigation Project (Assam), having Cultivable Command Area of 6,800 hectares, has been accepted by the Advisory Committee for Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose projects of this Ministry, for estimated cost of Rs.540.46 crore, at 2019-2020 price level.(d) The States submit the proposal for appraisal through a portal created by CWC for this purpose, namely ePAMS, whereby the appraisal is taken up in a transparent and time-bound manner, duly monitored at various levels. However, technical approval of Pre-Feasibility Report, or techno-economic approval of Detailed Project Report of a project, is accorded by the concerned Committee of this Ministry, once the proposal satisfies the criteria laid down in the CWC Guidelines. *****
