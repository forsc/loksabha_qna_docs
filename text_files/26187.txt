ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR](a) There are 21 Community Radio Stations (CRSs) in the country, operated by Krishi Vigyan Kendras, serving agricultural sectors. However, other CRSs also broadcast programmes related to the agricultural sector, as per needs of the community. A State/UT-wise list of these CRSs is available at the Ministry’s website www.mib.gov.in.(b) In pursuance with the Policy Guidelines for setting up of Community Radio Stations in India, preference is accorded to Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to enable dissemination of information pertaining to agricultural methods, use of modern technology and practices for enhancement of output, consequently enhancing the income of farmers in line with the mandate of the Government. Further, the applications for setting up of Community Radio Stations by KVKs are given single window clearance. A financial assistance, upto 75% of the total cost or Rs. 7.5 lakhs, whichever is lower, is provided to these stations for setting up of CRSs.(c) The Government of India has approved a Central Sector Scheme namely “Supporting Community Radio Movement in India”. Under the scheme, funds are being allocated to conduct various activities for development of CRSs. These activities are of pan-India nature. There is no provision of funds allocation to a State/UT under the scheme. A financial assistance is provided directly to the CRSs for procurement of capital equipment for setting up of CRSs.(d) Various initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote the growth of Community Radio Stations in the country, particularly in the coastal regions. Letters have also been written to Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs, including Chief Secretaries of coastal states, to utilize the services of CRSs and identify organizations which are eligible to establish CRSs.****
