                                                        MINISTER FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)	to (c) A statement of reply is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 427 due for reply on 25.03.2021(a) to (c) 	In March, 2017, in the whole country, 27,544 habitations were identified with Arsenic and Fluoride contamination in drinking water sources and to make provision of potable piped water supply in these habitations on priority, National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched. As reported by States, except 1,369, in all of these habitations, potable drinking water has become available. To provide potable tap water supply to every rural household in the country by 2024, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water to rural households, priority is given to quality–affected  habitations. While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants, as on 31st March of the preceding financial year. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source is likely to take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet drinking and cooking requirements.In ground water, concentration of chemical contaminants like Arsenic, Fluoride, Iron, salinity, nitrate, heavy metals, etc. is dynamic and drinking water sources are tested from time to time. As reported by States/ UTs, as on date, 48,169 rural habitations are reported to have quality issues in drinking water sources. As an interim measure, in 2,637 of these rural habitations, community water purification plants (CWPP) have already been installed. In these quality-affected habitations, to provide potable tap water to every household, States/ UT are prioritising planning and implementation of piped water supply scheme sunder Jal Jeevan Mission.****
