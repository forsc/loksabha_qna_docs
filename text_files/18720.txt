ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):   No, Sir. There is no such report available in Department of Fertilizers and ICAR.(b):  Yes, Sir. Vide notification dated 25th May, 2015, Department of Fertilizers had made it mandatory for all the domestic producers of urea to produce 100% as Neem Coated Urea, with the objective of promoting the balanced use of fertilizers. Entire quantity of indigenously produced urea and imported urea is being neem coated w.e.f 1st September, 2015 and w.e.f 1st December, 2015 respectively. Further, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) was entrusted to conduct a study to determine the impact of Neem Coated Urea. As per the report of the study carried out by DAC&FW by engaging Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation Centre (ADRTC), Bengaluru, introduction of 100% Neem Coated Urea has resulted in the increase in yield levels of both main product and by-products in all reference crops. Farmers have reaped the positive externalities of Neem Coated Urea in terms of increased outputs in respect of all the reference crops, reduced costs (in terms of pest and disease control) and thereby increased returns. As per the report, further the diversion of urea has been reduced by the introduction of Neem Coated Urea.(c):   Yes Sir. All urea manufacturing units including NFL-Panipat in Haryana have started production of 100% Neem Coated Urea. Details of the production of Neem Coated Urea during the year 2019-20 of all the units are given in Annexure.                                    *********
