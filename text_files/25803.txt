                                                        (a)	and (b):  The Government is aware of some media reports about instances of unauthorized use of personal data and data breaches of personal information of users through social networking sites.

Section 43A of the Act provides for compensation to be paid to the affected users in case of unauthorized access of information and leakage of sensitive personal information respectively. It mandates ‘body corporate’ to implement ‘reasonable security practices’ for protecting ‘sensitive personal information’ of individuals. Section 72A of the Act provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment upto 3 years and fine for disclosure of information in breach of the lawful contract. Also, Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021notified under the IT Act, 2000 require that the intermediary shall publish the rules and regulations, privacy policy and user agreement for access or usage of its computer resource by any person.The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 11, 2019 by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
