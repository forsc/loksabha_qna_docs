ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 and Statutes framed under the Act, which inter alia provides autonomy in the functioning of the IITs, through Board of Governors constituted for the purpose.  At present, there is no proposal under consideration of the Government to grant further autonomy to IITs.(c) & (d): A proposal to allow those IIT students who are not able to keep pace with the required academic standards to opt for B.Sc. (Engineering) after the second semester (instead of being forced out of the course) came for discussion in the recent IIT Council meeting.  In case of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs) in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode, the Coordination Forum chaired by the Minister of Human Resource Development, in its meeting held on 16.10.2019 has approved a similar proposal authorizing the respective Boards of Governors (BoGs) to decide on the modalities for its implementation. There is no such proposal in respect of other premier engineering institutions.(e)	: A total of 7248 students have dropped out from IITs during the last five years.  Some of the reasons for postgraduate students leaving the courses midway are the offers for placement and better opportunities.(f)	: Government is providing fellowship/Scholarship/Assistantship and tuition fee waiver, as applicable to the students pursuing different courses in IITs.  IITs have also initiated various steps to reduce the dropout rate of students in the Institutes, which includes, regular counselling and monitoring of the academically weak students, providing facilities on campus for the students to de-stress, sports facilities, organization of workshops on stress management, problem-solving, etc.  Similarly counselling and career guidance services are also provided to the students throughout the year in all Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to address the issue of dropouts.*****
