ANSWER




                                                        THE HON’BLE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFAREDR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR(a) to (e):	As per the Indian Council of Medical Research''s Cancer Registry Data Report on "National Cancer Registry Programme, 2020", the estimated number of incidence of cancer cases was 1358415 in 2019 and 1392179 in 2020. Review of scientific literature reveals that : (i) Cancer is known to be a disease that increases in incidence with increasing age; (ii) Control of communicable diseases has increased life expectancy and therefore exposed more of the population towards the development of cancer; (iii) The increase in population due to growth also contributes to the increase in the number of cancer cases; (iv) Improved awareness, greater consciousness about health in general and cancer in particular makes more and more people seek medical advice at an earlier stage and (v) Availability of sophisticated and improved diagnostic techniques aid in detection of tumours that would have been missed at earlier times.As per the ICMR Report on "National Cancer Registry Programme, 2020", the estimated mortality of cancer cases reported in the country in 2019 and 2020 was 751517 and 770230 respectively.****
