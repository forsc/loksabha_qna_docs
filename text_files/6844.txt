                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI SHRIPAD NAIK)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   ????? ????? ??????					(???? ??????? ????)   (a) to (c):	The Government regularly reviews the security scenario and takes appropriate measures from time to time to maintain/ upgrade the country''s defence preparedness. The authorization and holding of ammunition is as per operational requirement of the Armed Forces and they are well equipped for meeting any emergent operational requirements. Procurement of weapons/ equipment and ammunition is carried out on a continuous basis as per the Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP) which in turn is part of the Service Capital Acquisition Plan (SCAP) of five years. The procurement process aims at keeping the Defence Forces in a state of readiness and remaining equipped with modern weapon systems. Mismatches between requirements and availability can sometimes occur which are continually addressed by the on-going procurement process.     Several measures have been taken to ensure adequate availability of ammunition. In addition, financial powers, to ensure the availability and maintenance of minimum levels of critical ammunition, have been delegated to Armed Forces to meet any emergent requirement and to enable them to maintain military preparedness at all times. *****
