ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU) (a) to (d):   Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Land Resources (DoLR), which is the nodal Ministry dealing with land acquisition matter, have informed that the land acquisition is undertaken by the Central and State Governments under various Central and State Acts, including the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, which is being administered by DoLR and the provisions of the RFCTLARR Act 2013 are implemented by appropriate Government as defined under Section 3 (e) of the said Act. There is no central database relating to land acquisition  for States or other Ministries / Departments concerned including details of Displacement of Tribals. Section 4 (5) of The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 states that save as otherwise provided, no member of a forest dwelling Scheduled Tribe or Other Traditional Forest Dwellers shall be evicted or removed from the Forest Land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, also provides that the Gram Sabha or the Panchayats at the appropriate level shall be consulted before making the acquisition of land in the Scheduled Areas or development projects and before resettling or rehabilitating persons affected by such projects in the Scheduled Areas; the actual planning and implementation of the projects in the Scheduled Areas shall be coordinated at the State Level.  Constitutional provisions under Schedule -V also provide safeguards against displacement of tribal population because of land acquisitions etc.*****
