                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b)  Erosion, movement and deposition of sediment in a river are natural regulating functions of a river. Rivers tend to maintain a balance between the silt load carried &silt load deposited, maintaining a river regime. Soil erosion caused by heavy floods is a matter of concern as it leads to several associated problems like changes in river course, causing loss of land, etc. Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. The Government of India has been making continuous efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management and erosion control.Morphological Studies by various IITs and NIITs have been carried out for major rivers like Ganga, Sharda, Rapti, Kosi, Bagmati, Subansari, Krishna, Mahanadi Mahanada, etc. These Studies aid in finding the vulnerable spots for bank erosion/deposition, aggradations/ degradation etc. As per the morphological studies conducted by Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, the details of total area of land eroded and deposited by river Brahmaputra between the period 2003-05 to 2008-11  is as under-Period	Erosion (in sq. Km) 	Depostion (in sq, Km)Between 2003-05 to 2008-11	252.6	118.6Contd…P/2//2//(c) During XI Plan Government of India had launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) for providing Central Assistance to States for works related to flood management and erosion control which continued during XII Plan and thereafter, as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21. Central Assistance to the tune of Rs.1286.39 crores has been provided to State of Assam up to March 2021 under FMP component of this Programme. Government of India released an amount of Rs.142.12 Crores during 2018-19 and Rs.85.03 Crores during 2019-20 to Assam for the projects taken up by the Water Resources Department under Flood Management Programme. Brahmaputra Board in Assam has taken up several anti-erosion measures in River Brahmaputra like protection of Majuli Island from flood and erosion, avulsion of river at Dhola Hatighuli in Tinsukia District, protection of Mankachar Kalair-Alga at India-Bangladesh Border area from erosion, protection of Masalabari area from erosion in Dhubri District of Assam.
