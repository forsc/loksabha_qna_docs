                                                        THE MINISTER OF  STATE (FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b):	The Government has launched various policy and programmatic interventions in the field of Agriculture, including irrigation. A statement indicating details of such schemes/programmes is at Annexure-I.(c)&(d): The government has taken various steps to promote foreign and domestic investments in the country which, inter-alia, include measures to improve ease of doing business, comprehensive reforms in the Foreign Direct Investment policy, introduction of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, launch of GST and reduction of Corporate tax. The Government has put in place an investor-friendly policy framework which is transparent, predictable and easily comprehensible. The foreign investment regulatory regime has been liberalized significantly and currently, except for a small negative list, most sectors/activities are allowed to avail 100% foreign investment through the automatic route. As a result of the measures taken to improve the countries investment climate, India jumped to 63rd place in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Ranking as per World Bank’s Doing Business Report, 2020. A table indicating the foreign and domestic investments in the country during the last three years is at Annexure-II.
