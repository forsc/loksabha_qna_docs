                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) & (b) The State/UT-wise number of Gram Panchayats (GP) computerized and yet to be computerized are given at Annexure.(c)        Panchayat being a State subject, providing basic infrastructure including computers etc. is primarily the responsibility of concerned State Government/ UT administration. The level of computerization of GPs varies among States, depending upon the availability of electric power supply, internet connectivity, adequate computer- trained manpower, financial resources at the GP level etc.(d)       Under the erstwhile scheme of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA), Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) had provided financial assistance to States/ UTs for e-enablement including computers and peripherals upto 2014-15. Under the newly launched scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), funds have also been provided to States/UTs for provision of computer for their e-enablement.                  Upto 10% of the Grants under Fourteenth Finance Commission can be used by GPs for technical and administrative support towards Operation & Maintenance and Capital expenditure.  Expenditure towards (i) purchase of computer and accessories as well as cost of Annual Maintenance Cost in GPs, which do not have any computer at present and (ii) one-time cost for providing internet connectivity and recurring charges can also be incurred from the 10 % Operation & Maintenance expenditure.          MoPR is also implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) under which a suite of core common applications has been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats’unctioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licenses etc.        For attaining the vision of Digital India, BharatNet project is being implemented by Department of Telecommunications in a phased manner to create network to connect all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2.53 lakh) by broadband in the country. As on 22nd January 2020, a total of 1,25,886 Gram Panchayats have been made Service Ready. *****
