ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a)&(b): No, Sir. As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty.(c): The quantity of coal imported during the last three years is given below:-Import of Coal  (MT)Year	Coking	Non Coking	Total2016-17 	41.64	149.31	190.952017-18 	47.00	161.27	208.272018-19 (P)	51.84	183.40	235.24(d): The entire demand of coal is not met from domestic production as the supply of high quality coal/ coking coal (low-ash-coal) in the country is limited and thus no option is left but to resort to import of coking coal. Further, coal imported by power plants designed on imported coal and high grade coal required for blending purposes cannot be substituted by domestic coal.Domestic supply as a percentage of Total Demand/Supply (2018-19)Quantity in Million Tonnes 	Total Coal	Domestic Supply Coking	% Share	Domestic Supply Non-Coking	% ShareTotal actual Demand/Supply	969.14	17.50	1.81	716.40	73.92****
