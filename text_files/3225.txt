                                                        MINISTER FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)	to (c) A Statement of reply is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 278 due for reply on 11.07.2019(a)and (b)Drinking water supply is a state subject. Under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation supplements the efforts of states for improving the coverage of drinking water in rural areas of the country. As reported by States on Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), out of total rural population of 9182.58 lakhs, 7001.50 lakhs population (76.25%) are fully covered (i.e. getting more than 40 litres per capita per day safe drinking water) and 1815.66 lakhs population (19.77%) are partially covered (i.e. getting less than 40 litres per capita per day safe drinking water) as on 07.07.2019. Hence, 96.02% rural population have access to drinking water in the villages.The availability of drinking water in rural areas is affected by many factors which include, inter alia, depletion of ground water level, contamination of surface water sources, drying up of ponds & wells, increase in population, deficient rainfall leading to insufficient recharge of water bodies etc.(c) Under NRDWP, the Ministry provides technical and financial assistance to the states to improve the availability of drinking water in rural areas. During 2018-19, Rs. 5466.24 crore has been released to states for improving the coverage of drinking water in rural areas which resulted in coverage of more number of rural populations with drinking water. Details of physical coverage during 2018-19 are as under:Financial Year	Fully covered habitations (in Nos.)	Partially covered habitations (in Nos.)	Quality affected habitations (in Nos.)2018-19	32460	30964	4378 (Source: IMIS)
