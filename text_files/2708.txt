The discoveries have been offered under Revenue Sharing Contracts where the operator will be sharing biddable percentage share of revenue to the Government, besides paying royalty. Actual revenue realization from the fields may vary based on development strategy adopted, actual production realized, techno-economics of the individual field and price of oil and gas, etc.
