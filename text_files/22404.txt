ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (f)	 India’s engagement with China is complex. The two sides agree that the future direction of India China relations should be built upon respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations. The two sides have also agreed to manage their differences and not allow differences on any issue to become disputes.As regards the boundary question, the two sides agree that pending final settlement of the boundary question, maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas is an essential basis for the overall development of the bilateral relationship.Since April/May 2020 the Chinese side undertook several attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Western Sector. These attempts have been responded to appropriately by our armed forces. It has been made clear to the Chinese side that such unilateral attempts are unacceptable. These actions have seriously disturbed the peace and tranquility along the LAC in the Western Sector.The two sides have maintained communication through both diplomatic and military channels to ensure complete disengagement from all friction points and full restoration of peace and tranquility in the India-China Border Areas. The two sides were able to reach an agreement on disengagement in the North and South Bank of the Pangong Lake, which has been completed. There are however still some outstanding issues with regard to deployment and patrolling at some other points along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh.Government will continue discussions with the Chinese side to resolve the remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh and achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China Border Areas at an early date.***
