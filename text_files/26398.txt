ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) and (b): Institute of Banking Personnel Selection, which is the agency engaged by banks for conducting recruitment examinations for nationalised banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), has informed that it has been conducting examinations for RRBs with an option to choose 13 regional languages for the post of Officers Scale I and Office Assistants (Multipurpose) in addition to Hindi and English from the year 2019 onwards. (c) to (e): Recruitment by IBPS for nationalised banks and RRBs, for vacant positions of clerks in nationalised banks and Office Assistant (Multi-purpose) and Officers Scale-I in RRBs, is  based on the vacancies reported for a particular State/Union Territory by nationalised banks and RRBs respectively. IBPS has provided details of State-wise provisional allotment made during the last five years in nationalised banks for clerks and in RRBs for Officer Scale I and Office Assistants (Multipurpose) based on vacancies reported by participating banks. The same is annexed as Annexure I, II and III respectively. Since banks are filling these vacant positions as per the vacancies arising in particular State/Union Territory, the question of regional imbalance does not arise. In case of vacant positions of Probationary Officers (JMGS-I) in nationalised banks, these are filled-up based on vacancies reported by the nationalised banks on all India basis.   *****
