ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):     The State Govt. of Kerala had submitted proposal vide letter dated 31st August, 2018 to the Ministry regarding damage cases to houses during floods in year 2018 with the request to provide 100% of the unit cost @ Rs.4 lakh per house as a special case for 12477 houses exempting guidelines parameters and category ratio of PMAY-G.  Further, Govt. of Kerala had also proposed to provide assistance to those households also who are not part of the Permanent Wait List of PMAY-G.  The Cabinet decisions and the Framework for Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G allows PMAY-G assistance of Rs.1.20 lakh on sharing basis in the ratio of 60:40 only to those households whose name feature in SECC list and consequently in Permanent Wait List (PWL) of that Gram Panchayat.  Since these households were not part of PWL, thus the request of the State could not be agreed to.	In respect of PMAY-U, in September 2018, the State Government of Kerala informed that a total of 17,810 houses had been destroyed / damaged in urban areas in the devastating flood occurred in August 2018 and requested for special sanction to provide financial assistance to renovate houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY (U)] damaged in the flood. In response, Rs. 492.95 crore of central assistance was released to the State of Kerala by relaxing the conditions, as a special case, for releasing 2nd installment, for construction of houses including those damaged due to floods which were approved under PMAY(U). The State Government of Kerala was also advised to submit project proposals, as soon as possible, with due approval of the State Government for construction of houses of the flood affected persons/households who are eligible under PMAY (U) for consideration of grant of central assistance as admissible under PMAY (U).	Under PMAY-G, targets have not been allocated to the State of Kerala during the financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20 owing to exhaustion of the PWL of the State.  On the request of Govt. of Kerala for surrendering targets of 17651 houses owing to exhaustion of PWL, the Empowered Committee in its meeting held on 16th June, 2020   had approved surrendering of targets with the advice to remove the name of ineligible beneficiaries from PWL using remand module.  	PMAY (U) being implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, aims at providing houses to all eligible urban beneficiaries including those affected by flood. Under PMAY (U), 1,21,768 houses involving central assistance of Rs. 1,953.84 crore have been sanctioned so far in the State of Kerala. Central assistance of Rs. 1,311.74 crore [including Rs. 341.68 crore as interest subsidy under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme vertical of PMAY (U)] has been released. Of the sanctioned houses, 97,914 houses have been grounded for construction of which 71,702 have been completed.  Details of District-wise and year-wise Physical and Financial Progress in the State of Kerala under PMAY-(U) during 2018-19 & 2019-2020 are given at Annexure.*******                                                                               ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.302 to be answered on 15.09.2020 District wise and year wise Physical and Financial Progress in the State of Kerala under PMAY-U during 2018-19 and 2019-2020.Note: Houses completed and Central Assistance released are inclusive of completed houses and released Central Assistance for which sanctions were accorded during preceding years (source: information received from Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs)
