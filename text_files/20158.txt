ANSWER




                                                        (a): Cyber space is a complex environment of people, software, hardware and services on the Internet. With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue. Any Apps created from anywhere in the world and made available through Internet/AppsStores from can be accessed anywhere.   Most of such Apps tend to collect large amount of personal data.  Such data can be further transferred to any other entity.  Though all such collection,  processing and transfer should happen with the prior consent of the user, there is always a danger regarding possible misuse and privacy risk for users.(b): Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) does not monitor content/App available on Internet. However, law enforcement agencies monitor such content on  a case-to-case basis.  (c): Social networking companies, for the third party information hosted on their platforms, are intermediaries in the context of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. They are required to follow certain due diligence as specified in the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 notified under section 79 of the IT Act. This includes publishing of terms and conditions of their platform and privacy policy.
