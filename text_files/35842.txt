(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)  to (c):  The primary responsibility of management of crop failures rests with the State Government.  As per report from the State Government of Kerala, there has been crop loss on account of natural calamities.  For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with the State Government in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government, in accordance with established procedures.             The details of funds allocated and released to Kerala during the last two years and the current year under SDRF and NDRF are as follows:(Rs. in crore)Year	   Allocation under SDRF	Release of Central Share under SDRF	Released from NDRF	Central Share	State Share		2019-20	168.75	56.25	136.65	0.002020-21	314.00	105.00	314.00	0.002021-22	251.20	84.00	251.20	0.00(d):	The Central Government implements Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)/ Central Sector (CS) Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), the Rainfed Area Development Programme (RAD) etc. which contribute towards drought proofing. Central and State Governments have committed considerable resources in strengthening resilience to droughts through the creation of irrigation potential, promotion of conservation and efficient harvesting of water, adoption of watershed management approach, development of abiotic stress tolerant varieties of crops, improved agronomic practices etc. Besides, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare through ICAR – Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) has formulated District Agricultural Contingency Plans for 650 districts in the country including all 14 districts of Kerala for implementing location specific interventions to sustain agriculture production in the eventuality of any extreme climatic events.   Government of India has constituted the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for the purpose of mitigation projects in respect of   disasters including drought covered under the State Disaster Response Fund/National Disaster Response Fund and the State specific local disasters notified by the State Governments.  Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, comprehensive risk insurance against crop damage from pre sowing to post harvest for food crops, oilseeds and annual commercial crops notified by the concerned State Governments can be taken.  States may consider add on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial and is identifiable.
