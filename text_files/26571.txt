ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): Yes Sir. The Government proposes to set up five new National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPERs) in the states of Tamil Nadu (Madurai), Chhattisgarh (New Raipur), Maharashtra (Nagpur), Rajasthan (Jhalawar) and Karnataka (Bangalore). A consolidated EFC proposal with an outlay of Rs.4,300 crore for the period 2020-21 to 2024-25 has been sent to the Ministry of Finance for strengthening the existing seven NIPERs and setting up of five new NIPERs. The proposal also includes construction of campuses, up-gradation of laboratories, setting up centres of excellences, salary of faculty & staff, fellowship to students and other administrative and academic expenses.  These institutes will fulfill the objectives, as laid in the NIPER Act, 1998, as amended from time to time, mainly relating to imparting postgraduate and doctorate education and conducting high end research in various specializations of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The estimated cost of setting up of a new NIPER, including recurring expenses for a period of five years is about Rs. 310 cr. (c): At present, seven NIPERs are functional across the country at SAS Nagar (Mohali, Punjab), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Guwahati (Assam), Hajipur (Bihar), Hyderabad (Telangana), Kolkata (West Bengal) and Raebareli (Uttar Pradesh). (d) & (e):  Yes Sir. The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research Act, 1998 (13 of 1998) was enacted to declare NIPER at SAS Nagar (Mohali, Punjab) to be an institute of national importance. The Act was subsequently amended in the year 2007 to empower the Central Government to establish similar institutes in different parts of the country. Thereafter, six new institutes at Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Raebareli were established during 2007-08. 			NIPER (Amendment) Bill, 2021, presently under consideration of the Parliament, has a provision that the existing six NIPERs as well as any other similar institute established under the NIPER Act shall be institutes of national importance.
