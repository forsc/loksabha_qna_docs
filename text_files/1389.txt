                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) 	to (c):  As per Section 2 (14) (ii) and (ix) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is found working in contravention of labour laws for the time being in force or is found begging, or living on the street and who is found vulnerable and is likely to be inducted into drug abuse or trafficking is included as a “child in need of care and protection”, among others. Section 41 of the Act also requires that all CCIs meant for covering children in need of care and protection (CNCP) or conflict with law (CCL) and shall be registered under this Act by the State Govt. Section 54 of the JJ Act requires all State Govt./UTs to appoint Inspection Committee for the State and district. Further, as per Section 54 (2) such inspection committees shall mandatorily conduct visits to all facilities housing children in the area allocated, at least once in three months in a team of not less than three members, of whom at least one shall be a woman and one shall be a medical officer, and submit reports of the findings of such visits within a week of their visit, to the District Child Protection Units or State Government, as the case may be, for further action. And as per Section 54 (3), on the submission of the report by the inspection committee, appropriate action shall be taken within a month by the District Child Protection Unit or the State Government and a compliance report shall be submitted to the State Government. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act, as such, lies with the State/UTs. However, Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing “Child Protection Services” (CPS) (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) under umbrella Integrated Child Development Services, and providing financial assistance, as Grant-in-Aid, to the States/UTs for, inter-alia, undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances, for setting up and maintenance of various types of CCIs. Further, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), a statutory organization under this Ministry, has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for care and protection of Children in Street situations. Under the scheme “Child Protection Services” (CPS), institutional care is provided through CCIs, as a rehabilitative measure. In these CCIs, children are provided appropriate education either within the institution or outside in a formal education system through convergence with other schemes and programs of the Government or civil society. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship.

As per Rule 239 of General Financial Rules, 2017, the State/UTs are required to provide Utilisation Certificate for Grants-in-aid provided to them for implementation of the scheme. “Ujjawala”, a comprehensive scheme to combat trafficking, was launched by the Ministry in 2007 and is being implemented mainly through NGOs. The Scheme has five components-Prevention, Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-Integration and Repatriation of trafficked victims for commercial sexual exploitation.
