ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):  Yes, sir. Owing to Covid-19 pandemic, the subdued demand in power and non-power sectors had adversely affected coal dispatch from the coal companies. The pithead coal stock at Coal India Limited was 99.13 MT as on 1st April, 2021 and 28.66 MT at the Thermal Power Plants. The coal production of the country got regulated due to high levels of coal inventory and less demand from the consumers. (b): LNG can be used in Mining Dump Truck as an alternate fuel by converting existing diesel dump trucks to Dual Fuel (Diesel – LNG) system by retrofitting LNG kits. CIL has  initiated  feasibility study for use of LNG in Dump trucks under CIL mining condition by retrofitting LNG kits in 02 nos. 100T dumpers at Lakhanpur Open Cast Project of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, on Pilot Project basis with the association of GAIL (India) Limited and BEML Limited (both PSUs). (c): The dual fuel system has potential to replace 30 - 50% of diesel with LNG which may go up to 70% depending on the engine characteristics. The actual figures may be worked out after the outcome of the Pilot Project.(d): The proposal for signing of tripartite MOU between CIL, GAIL and BEML has been approved by the CIL Board in its 426th meeting held on 12th July, 2021. (e): CIL and its Subsidiaries have taken up a series of measures to offset carbon emission in mining operations, which are mentioned as under:1.	Massive plantation & bio-reclamation : CIL  & its subsidiaries have already planted approximately 94.19 Lakh saplings over about 3,873 Ha. inside mine lease area. The CO2 offset value is about 1.55 lakh Tonnes per year.2.	Other measures are:i.	Replacing conventional lights by LED lights;ii.	Replacing conventional ACs and other appliances by Super-efficient ACs.iii.	Energy efficient pumpsiv.	Super-efficient fanv.	Auto-timer in street lights,3.	CIL & its subsidiaries have installed 5.3 MW of solar energy. (f) : CIL and its subsidiaries have planned following measures for carbon offset as under.1.	CIL & its Subsidiaries have planned to carry out plantation over about 6,800 Ha. in next 5 years (i.e. 2021-2026) which will offset  CO2  about   2.72 lakh Tonnes per year.2.	CIL and its Subsidiaries have planned to install 3000 MW of solar energy in next 5 years (i.e. 2021-2026) which will also offset CO2. 3.	CIL and its Subsidiaries  have planned for other  energy efficient measures in next 5 years (i.e. 2021-2026) which  includes  replacing conventional light by  LED lights, installing energy efficient ACs, Super fan, Efficient water heaters, Energy efficient motors for pumps, Auto-timer in street lights and to add  E-Vehicles  also.(g): CIL have planned to replace 2,044 No. motors with energy efficient motors in next five years.(h) : CIL and its subsidiaries have planned to procure about 1,072 No. of E-Vehicles in next five years.****
