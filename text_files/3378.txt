ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  The Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) estimated the total area liable to floods in the country as 40 Million Hectare (mha). The extent of maximum area affected by floods in any year during 1953-2010 as per the Working Group Report on Flood Management and Region Specific Issues for XII Plan is 49.815 mha, the State-wise break up of which is given at Annexure-I.             In 2006, a Committee, headed by Chairman, Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC), Patna, identified 39 districts in India as flood prone, out of which 9 districts were identified as flood prone in Assam. The name of the districts identified as flood-prone in the country by the said Committee is at Annexure-II.             For scientific assessment of flood prone areas in India, Ministry has constituted an Expert Committee under Chairman, Central Water Commission (CWC). The Expert Committee has constituted Regional Committees for each States/UTs with Principal Secretaries of Water Resources Department as its Chairman and Regional Chief Engineer/Director of CWC as its Member-Secretary. The mandate of the Regional Committees is to identify, demarcate and classify the flood prone areas in their respective State/UT based on the methodology, classification and criteria finalized by the Expert Committee. Contd…P/2//2//(c)  The subject of flood management including erosion control being within the purview of the States. The flood management & anti-erosion schemes are planned, investigated and implemented by the State Governments with their own resources as per priority within the State. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by way of technical guidance and promotional financial assistance to the States for flood management in critical areas.           Government of India launched a Flood Management Programme (FMP) during XI Plan for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued.             A total of 522 projects costing Rs.13238.36 crore were approved and included under FMP. Since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance to States under FMP up till March, 2019 is Rs. 5863.95 crore.              Flood Management Programme (FMP) and River Management Activities & Works related to Border Areas (RMBA) schemes continuing during XII Five Year Plan, have been merged into single scheme "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the three year period from 2017-18 to 2019-20.               Flood forecasting and warning system has been planned as a non–structural measure, as advance knowledge of incoming floods plays an important role in reducing flood damage as also better planning of rescue/ relief operations. The inflow forecast helps in optimum regulation of reservoirs. Central Water Commission at present has a network comprising of 325 flood forecast stations, of which 197 are level forecast and 128 are inflow forecast stations, of which 197 are level forecast and 128 are inflow forecast stations on major dams/barrages. It covers all major basins in the country covering 23 States and one Union Territory-Daman & Diu and National Capital Territory of Delhi.*****Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2955 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING “SURVEY UNDER FLOOD PRONE AREA  PROGRAMME”.State -wise Maximum Area Affected by Floods in any year during 1953-2010S.
