ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) No, Sir.(b), (c) and (e) As per information received from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, a recent article published in journal PeerJ in February 2020 talks about leopard population decline (between 75-90%) across different habitats in the Indian subcontinent over the last 120-200 years and not the current declines. However, this study also mentions that the magnitude of decline for leopards found in this study is in contrast to some earlier leopard studies in the subcontinent (for example ecological work by Harihar, Pandav & Goyal, 2011, and genetic work by Dutta et al., 2013) which suggest stable or increasing local leopard population trends. This study further mentions that they were unable to corroborate and support population decline patterns with leopard census data. (d) and (f) The important steps taken by the Government to protect leopards in the country are as given below:i.	Leopard is listed in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, thereby, according it highest degree of legal protection from hunting.ii.	Important habitats of wildlife which includes leopards are designated as national parks/ sanctuaries for their better protection.iii.	Financial and technical assistance is provided to the States/ Union Territories under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of ‘Development of Wildlife Habitat’ for providing better protection and conservation of wildlife including leopards and its habitat.iv.	Leopards are co-predators in its habitat and most of the leopard habitats in India are also part of tiger reserves. Financial assistance is provided to the tiger reserves under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme, ‘Project Tiger’, for protection and conservation of tigers and other animals including leopards. ***
