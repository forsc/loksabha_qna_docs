In order to encourage employment of women, a number of protective provisions have been incorporated in various labour laws for creating congenial work environment for women workers. These includes child care centers, enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provisions for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc. Government has taken a decision to allow the employment of women in the aboveground mines including opencast workings between 7 PM and 6 AM to all categories of employees and in below ground working between 6 AM and 7 PM in technical, supervisory and managerial work where continuous presence may not be required. The Code on Wages, 2019 provides that there shall be no discrimination in an establishment or any unit thereof among employees on the ground of gender in matters relating to wages by the same employer, in respect of the same work or work of similar nature done by any employee. Further, no employer shall make any discrimination on the ground of sex while recruiting any employee for the same work or work of similar nature in the conditions of employment, except where the employment of women in such work is prohibited or restricted by or under any law for the time being in force. Further, in order to enhance the employability of female workers, the Government is providing training to them through a network of Women Industrial Training institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes. Government is implementing National Career Service (NCS) Projects as a Mission Mode Project for transformation of the National Employment Service where a variety of employment related services like job search, job matching, career counselling, vocational guidance, information on skill development courses etc. are being provided under the NCS Project on a common platform with efficient use of information technology.
