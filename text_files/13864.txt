SLAs are legally empowered to take stringent action against violation of provisions of the Act and Rules. As per information received from State/UT Drugs Controllers including Chhattisgarh as on November, 2019, no complaint has been registered regarding death of any person due to use of spurious/counterfeit medicine during the last three years and the current year.(d):	The Government is committed to ensuring that the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs are not compromised.
