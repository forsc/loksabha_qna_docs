ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a) With an objective of making quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all the citizens, especially to the poor and the deprived ones, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals. Under the scheme, dedicated outlets known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJK) are opened all over the country to provide generic medicines to the masses. A medicine under the Scheme is priced on the principle of a maximum of 50% of the average price of top three branded medicines. Therefore, the price of Jan Aushadhi Medicines is cheaper at least by 50% and in some cases, by 80% to 90% of the market price of the branded medicines. The medicines listed in the product list of PMBJP are procured only from World Health Organization – Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP) certified suppliers for ensuring the quality of the products. Apart from this, each batch of drug is tested at laboratories accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). Only after passing the quality tests, the medicines are dispatched to PMBJP Kendras. In order to ensure easy availability of the menstrual health services to all women across India, “Janaushadhi Suvidha” sanitary pads are made available at PMBJP Kendras for sale @ Rs 1.00 per pad across the country. Under the Scheme, the Government is providing financial assistance to the operating agencies/ private entrepreneurs in the following manner:i.	Rs. 5.00 lakh is given to the PMBJK owner @ 15% of monthly purchases made, subject to a ceiling of Rs. 15,000/- per month.ii.	One-time incentives of Rs. 2.00 lakh for furniture & fixtures is provided to the PMBJP Kendras opened in North-Eastern States, Himalayan areas, Island territories and backward areas mentioned as aspirational district by NITI Aayog or opened by women entrepreneur, Divyang, SC & ST.(b) As on 22.01.2021, 7161 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) are functional across the country including Assam, Bihar and Gujarat. The State/UT-wise list of PMBJKs is enclosed as Annexure.(c)  Department of Pharmaceuticals has requested State/UT Governments to facilitate opening of Janaushadhi Kendras in the premises of Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs)/Community Health Centers (CHCs)/Hospitals, including super specialty hospitals, by providing rent-free space within their premises. The inclusion of provision of one-time additional incentive of Rs. 2.00 lakh for Kendras opened in North-Eastern States, Himalayan areas, Island territories and backward areas is also a step for enhancing the penetration of Kendras. The Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), the implementing agency of the Scheme, also organizes various workshops and seminars on regular basis to encourage private entrepreneurs/NGOs/Civil Societies and unemployed pharmacists for opening PMBJP Kendras.(d) The details of the funds sanctioned, allocated and utilized under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana since its launch is as under:(Rs. in Crore)Sl. No.	Financial Year	Funds Allocated 	Funds Utilized 1	2008-09	1.73	0.622	2009-10	2.00	1.083	2010-11	3.00	1.204	2011-12	0	1.085	2012-13	1.66	2.286	2013-14	15.20	1.517	2014-15	0	13.638	2015-16	16.91	26.289	2016-17	49.75	49.7510	2017-18	47.64	47.6411	2018-19	42.51	42.5012	2019-20	35.51	35.51(e) In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) Kendras have rendered essential services to the nation. The stores remained functional during lockdown and maintained operations as part of their commitment to ensure uninterrupted availability of essential medicines. Adequate stock of the medicines and surgicals which was under demand, viz., Face Mask, Hydroxychloroquine, Paracetamol and Azithromycin was maintained. Around 25 lakh Face Masks, 1.25 lakh units of sanitizers, 137 lakh tablets of Hydroxychloroquine and 323 lakh Paracetamol Tablets was sold from the month of March, 2020 to 22nd January, 2021 through more than 7100 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) functioning across the country, at affordable prices. In financial year 2020-21, sale of Rs. 506.16 Cr. is made till 22nd January, 2021, which has led to savings of about Rs. 3,000 Crores (approx.) to the citizens as compared to the branded medicines.(f) & (g). At present, product basket of PMBJP comprises of 1449 drugs and 204 surgical instruments. Regular efforts are made for augmenting the product basket of PMBJP so that essential medicines and surgicals are readily available. It has been decided to increase the product basket to 2000 medicines and 300 surgicals by March, 2024 under various therapeutic segments. In order to improve the functioning of the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), Information Technology (IT) enabled End-to-End supply chain system with Point-of-Sale (POS) application for value added services has been implemented in PMBJP. Further, the logistics system is being strengthened. At present three warehouses are functional at Gurugram, Chennai and Guwahati and fourth one is under construction at Surat. Further, 37 distributors have been appointed across the country to support the supply of medicines to remote and rural areas.A mobile application “Janaushadhi Sugam” has also been launched for facilitating the general public by providing a digital platform at the tip of their fingers, by the virtue of which they can avail a host of user-friendly options like - locate nearby PMBJK (direction guided through Google Maps), search Janaushadhi medicines, analyse product comparison of Generic Vs Branded medicines in the form of MRP & overall savings, etc. The awareness on Jan Aushadhi generic medicines is spread through advertisements on TV, FM Radio and Cinema, extensive use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc., display through Auto wrappings, Bus Brandings, State Transport Bus Stands, Audio and Digital Screen Advertisements at Railway Stations and by organizing workshops in various parts of the country.
