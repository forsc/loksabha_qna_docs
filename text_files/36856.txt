ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance (a) to (c)  In terms of the revised guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide circular No DBR.BAPD.BC.69/22.01.001/2016-17 dated May 18, 2017 on ‘Rationalization of Branch Authorization Policy’ the term “ Branch” has been substituted by “Banking Outlet (BO)” which includes both physical brick and mortar branches and Business Correspondent (BC) outlets, to enable banks in expanding their network even in remote rural areas in a cost-effective manner for hassle free services to customers. As informed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), State-wise/ UT wise roadmap (targets) and achievements for providing banking facilities to the villages with population more than 5000, more than 2000 and less than 2000 is at Annexure I, II and III.  Further to the above, in order to ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch/ Business Correspondent/India Post Payments Bank) within 5 kilometres of all inhabited villages in country, the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based App., namely, Jan Dhan Darshak App. Based on the data uploaded by the Banks on this App, as on 28.02.2022, there are 5,53,804 mapped inhabited villages in the country, out of which 5,53,571 (99.96%) are covered with a banking outlet. For the state of Maharashtra, out of the 37,842 inhabited villages mapped on this App,37,812 villages (99.92 %) are covered with a banking outlet.  District -wise number of Public Sector Bank branches in Maharashtra is at Annexure - IV.(d) to (f) In pursuance of extant RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process looked after by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required. Accordingly, as and when any request for opening of branch is received, the same is forwarded to concerned SLBCs / UTLBCs for appropriate action in consultation with the State Governments, Member banks & other stakeholders. *****
