ANSWER




                                                        (a): Yes Sir. The generic medicines, along with branded ones, are available in the country, subject to compliance to provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules made thereunder. Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the State Drug Controllers grants necessary permissions in this regard. (b) & (c): Both generic and branded drugs are treated alike for fixation of ceiling price under provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO). As per provisions of DPCO, all manufacturers of scheduled medicines (branded or generic) have to sell their products within the ceiling price fixed by the Government. As regards non-scheduled formulations, whether branded or generic, manufacturers are free to fix their Maximum Retail Price (MRP), but are not allowed to increase the price by more than 10 % per annum during what was prevailing in the preceding 12 months. While the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals fixes and monitor the prices of scheduled medicines, it monitors the same in case of non-scheduled medicines. (d) and (e): No such proposal is under consideration of the Government.
