ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b)	The Department of School Education and Literacy, Government of India is implementing several schemes such as Samagra Siksha, Mid Day Meal, Padhna Likhna Abhiyan, National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS), Scheme for Providing Education to Madarsas/Minorities (SPEMM) and Appointment of language teachers in collaboration with State Government of Karnataka to ensure educational development in the education sector. The new integrated scheme Samagra Shiksha envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a school meal programme in India designed to better the nutritional standing of school-age children nationwide. New literacy scheme ‘Padhna Likhna Abhiyan’ is going to be a leap forward to achieve the goal of Total Literacy by 2030.  The Central Sector Scheme ‘National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme’ was launched in May, 2008 with the objective to award scholarships to meritorious students of economically weaker sections to arrest their drop out at class VIII and encourage them to continue the study at secondary stage.The details of  fund allocation/spent, released and yet to be released during last 3 years under  Samagra Shiksha, Mid Day Meal, Padhna Likhna Abhiyan & National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme are as under:-(Rs in lakh)S.

Under SPEMM scheme, no fund has been released to State Government of Karnataka during last three years. However, under IDMI scheme, an amount of Rs.264.79 lakh has been approved in Project Approval Board Meeting. Due to non-submission of requisite documents, the said amount is yet to be released.  The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Financial Assistance for Appointment of Language Teachers was launched by this Department in 2019-20 and is currently under operation till 31.3.2021. This Department has given in-principle approval for providing Honorarium to 170 Urdu language teachers to the State Government of Karnataka under the ALT scheme. However, as the State Government has not made any actual recruitment against this Department’s approval, no funds have been released till now.(c)	Funds to be released during the financial year under the above mentioned schemes depend upon physical and financial progress, receipt of the audited accounts and fulfillment of other conditions as per the norms of the scheme. Under NMMSS, Scholarship is disbursed to the students directly by direct benefit transfer in to their account. (d)	Education is a subject in the concurrent list and majority of the schools in the country are under the administrative control of the States/UTs Governments. However, Ministry receives sporadic suggestions/complaint regarding irregularities in construction of schools, which are forwarded to the concerned State for the taking appropriate action as per their existing rules.************
