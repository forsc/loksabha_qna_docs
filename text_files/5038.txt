ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): As per latest R&D Statistics released by the National Science andTechnology Management Information System (NSTMIS) of the Department ofScience and Technology (DST), Research & Development (R&D) expenditure inIndia tripled during the period from 2004-05 to 2014-15. However, its size as apercentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remained at 0.7 per cent ascompared to 4.3% in Israel, 2 per cent in China and 1.2 per cent in Brazil. Oneof the reasons is less investment by the private sector on R & D, which accountsfor 65% to 75% of the total R&D investment in most technologically advancedcountries of the world as compared to only about 30 per cent in India.Government of India has taken a number of initiatives to enhance investment inR&D as well as to promote and improve the overall research eco-system in thecountry. These include Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY), which promotesindustry sponsored, outcome-oriented research with an outlay of Rs.475.00crore. 25% of the funds under UAY are contributed by the Industry. ImpactingResearch Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) focuses on socially relevantresearch in higher educational institutions with a budget provision of Rs.487crore. Establishment of 9 research parks at a total cost of Rs.775 crore, 8 ofthem being in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and one in IndianInstitute of Science (IISc). These research parks will propel innovation throughincubation and joint research between academia and industry. Prime Minister’sResearch Fellows (PMRF) Scheme launched with an outlay of Rs.1650 croreincentivises the most meritorious students to pursue research in the frontierareas of science & technology by offering attractive rates of fellowship fromRs.70,000/- to Rs.80,000/- per month in addition to research grant of Rs.2.00lakh per year for five years.*****
