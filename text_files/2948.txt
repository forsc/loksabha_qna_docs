                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING                                                   (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN) There are institutional mechanisms at the National and State level for effective management of natural disasters. As reported by Disaster Management Division, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), though the primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments, Central Government extends all possible logistics and financial supports to the States to supplement their efforts to meet the situation effectively. The concerned State Governments undertake assessment of damage and provide financial relief in the wake of natural disasters including cyclone, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) by following the laid down procedure by MHA. Financial assistance under SDRF/ NDRF in the wake of natural disasters is by way of relief and not for compensation of loss suffered/ claimed. Items and Norms of financial assistance under SDRF/NDRF inter alia includes assistance to fisherman. With regard to damages to Fisheries Sector by Cyclone ‘Gaja’, the Central Government inter alia had approved the assistance of Rs.3.88 crore to the State of Tamil Nadu. The medium and long term reconstruction and rehabilitation measures falls outside the purview of the norms/guidelines of SDRF/NDRF. Accordingly, State Governments are required to suitably address/undertake all necessary measures for rehabilitation, reconstruction and mitigation of medium/long terms works activities and allocate sufficient funds under ongoing regular scheme/plan etc.***
