These Guidelines are available at the portal nrega.nic.in. The Main Guidelines among them are Mahatma Gandhi NREGA Operational Guidelines and Annual Master Circulars, issued from year 2017-18 till 2020-21. It is the resposnibility of the State/UT Governments to ensure complaince with these Guidelines and to the Provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act and the relevant Rules. The Ministry has a comprehensive system of monitoring and review mechanism for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. The important elements of the above framework are listed below:i.	The Ministry regularly reviews the performance of the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in States/UTs through various fora viz., Mid-Term Review, Labour Budget Determination and Revision meetings, Programme Review meetings. Central Employment Guarantee Council and State Employment Guarantee Councils also periodically monitor implementation of the programme.ii.	National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions and Officers of the Ministry visit States/UTs at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States/UTs for appropriate action at their end.iii.	Auditing Standards for Social Audit have been issued and States/UTs have been advised to establish independent Social Audit Units, conduct Social Audit as per Audit of Scheme Rules, 2011 and training of village resource persons for conducting Social Audit etc. As per the Audit of the Scheme Rules, the audit of the works in a Gram Panchayat has been made mandatory.  Internal Audit Teams of the Department also conduct regular audit.iv.	Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and appointment of Ombudsperson in every district of States/UTs.v.	Steps have been taken for establishment of State Technical Cell at various level for qualitative monitoring and supervision of works under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.vi.	In order to ensure higher level of monitoring and oversight, National Mobile Monitoring System and Area Officer App have been introduced. In the former, attendance of workers on a particular work, where more than 20 workers are employed is taken daily along with a geo-tagged & time stamped photograph of theirs. The latter has been designed to ensure that field officials conduct inspections in the requisite numbers and look into all the relevant aspects of the scheme.vii.
