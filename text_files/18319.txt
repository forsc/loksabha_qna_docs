                                                        (a)&(b):	No, Sir.	The NCRPB was set up under the provisions of the National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985, for the preparation of a plan for the development of the National Capital Region (NCR) and for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of such plan. The above Act is available at ncrpb.nic.in/acts/html.         The NCR includes National Capital Territory of Delhi and parts of the States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.          The implementation of the Regional Plan is done by the respective NCR participating States including National Capital Territory of Delhi and the concerned Central Ministries/ Departments.           NCRPB, however, provides financial assistance to participating State Governments and their implementing agencies for infrastructure projects which are in line with the policies of its Regional Plan.           The projects are prepared and implemented by the constituent State Governments and their implementing agencies and other agencies as per NCRPB Rules.  (c):	NCRPB prepared the Regional Plan 2021 which was duly approved in its 28th Board meeting held on 09.07.2005 and was notified on 17.09.2005.         The Regional Plan 2021 for NCR, provides for broad inter-related policy framework for harmonious and balanced development of the region. It lays down policies and proposals for various sectors such as Settlement Pattern, Economic Activity & Fiscal Policy, Transport, Power, Water, Sewerage, Solid Waste Management, Drainage, Irrigation, Shelter, Social Infrastructure, Heritage and Tourism, Environment, Disaster Management, Regional Land Use, etc.           The policies and proposals of Regional Plan are implemented by the respective NCR participating States including National Capital Territory of Delhi. (d):	Yes, Sir. The preparation of Regional Plan, 2041 is in progress. Various steps like review of Regional Plan 2021, Stakeholder consultations, Workshops with experts and meeting of the Core Advisory Committee (CAC) have been conducted. (e):	National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) does not undertake/implement any project/scheme but only provides loan based financial support for the projects of the NCR Participating States and their implementing agencies.The details of the major transport projects financed during the last five years is enclosed at Annexure-I.(f):	NCRPB provides financial assistance to Participating States and their Implementing Agencies for various infrastructure development projects like Water Supply, Sewerage, Sanitation, Drainage, Solid Waste Management and Roads, ROB’s Flyovers, and Power Sector etc. The pattern of loan assistance provided by the NCR Planning Board is 25:75; 25% being the borrowing agency’s contribution and a maximum 75% of the project cost being the loan from the NCR Planning Board. The guidelines and terms & conditions for financial assistance from NCRPB are available at http://ncrpb.nic.in/pdf_files/Financial%20Guidelines.pdf.          The NCR Planning Board is providing financial assistance to State Govts/implementing agencies, out of NCRPB fund, set up under the section 22 (1) of the NCRPB Act, 1985. This fund is sourced from following:•	Annual Budgetary Contribution from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Govt. Of India;•	Repayment of earlier loans;•	Market borrowings;•	Loan from multilateral / bilateral agencies; and•	Interest income on loans and other internal accruals;         During the last three years, NCRPB has extended financial assistance on various infrastructure development project. Details of projects other than those under Transport Sector (Annexure-I) are at Annexure-II.                                    *****
