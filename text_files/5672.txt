                                                        (a)and (b) : Cyber space is a complex environment of people, software, hardware and services on the Internet. With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for abuse of cyberspace and social media platforms is a global issue. Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 empowers Government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above. Year-wise detail of no. of URLs blocked on social media platforms are as follows :Year	No. of URLs ordered for blocking2016	6332017	13852018	27992019  (till June 2019)	2163 (c):	''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects as per the Constitution of India and States are primarily responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of cybercrimes through their law enforcement machinery. The Law Enforcement Agencies take legal action against the cyber-crime offenders as per the provisions of applicable laws. The data related to penalization of social media platform operator is not maintained by MeitY.(d): 	Government regularly interacts with social media platforms regarding the steps to be taken to make social media safer. Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) as well as Police are in regular touch with various social media platforms to effectively address the issue of removal of objectionable content*******
