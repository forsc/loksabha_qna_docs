                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	The dispute regarding what constitutes the definition of ‘Gross Revenue’ as provided in the license agreement was subjudice before the Ld. Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal and Hon’ble Supreme Court since 2003. The TDSAT in a number of cases had stayed the recovery of demands by DoT. The Hon’ble Supreme Court also vide its interim order dated 29-02-2016 had allowed the Department of Telecom to raise the demands as per its understanding without enforcing them. The licensees of the Department of Telecom were making payments based on their own understanding.(b)	The Cellular Operators Association of India vide their letter dated 29.10.2019 has sought urgent intervention of the Government to avert such an unprecedented impact on the financial health of their member companies. However, one of the members of the Cellular Operators Association of India i.e. Reliance  Jio Infocom Ltd has submitted a divergent opinion on the said matter.(c)	The Hon’ble Supreme Court in their judgment dated 24-10-2019 have observed that the revenue sharing package turned out to be very very beneficial to the Telecom Service Providers, which is evident from the continuing rise in the Gross Revenue which is as follows:<pre>Financial Year (ending in March)	Gross Revenue (in Crore)2004	4,8552006	2,6662007	89,1082008	1,05,0612009	1,43,0442010	1,44,2322011	1,60,2512012	1,82,6372013	2,04,2212014	2,24,4302015	2,37,676</pre>(d)	The Cellular Operators Association of India vide their letter dated 29.10.2019 has sought urgent intervention of the Government to avert such an unprecedented impact on the financial health of their member companies. However, one of the members of the Cellular Operators Association of India i.e. Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd has submitted a divergent opinion on the said matter.************
