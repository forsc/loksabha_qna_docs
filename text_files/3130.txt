ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	 A contract for the supply of the Russian S-400 Long Range Surface to Air Missile System to India was concluded in October 2018. The U.S. “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” (CAATSA) requires the imposition of certain sanctions on persons/entities that have knowingly engaged in a “significant transaction” with the defence or intelligence sectors of Russia. The U.S. Department of State will determine whether a transaction is “significant” for purposes of section 231 of CAATSA on a case-by-case basis. The U.S. National Defence Authorization Act of FY 2019 contains a provision for Presidential waiver for CAATSA sanctions subject to reporting and certification requirements by the Administration. Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all necessary measures to safeguard it. Our requirement for the S-400 system has been clearly conveyed to the U.S. side, including during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State to India on 26 June 2019. ***
