                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (e):  Modernisation of police forces is a continuous and ongoing process. Although ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, to supplement the efforts of the States, assistance is provided to the State Governments for equipping and modernizing of their police forces under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’ [erstwhile scheme of Modernisation of State Police Forces]. The State Governments have been provided central assistance for acquisition of latest weaponry, training gadgets, advanced communication and    forensic    equipment    etc.    Further,   Jharkhand   is   also   permitted --2—LS.US.Q.NO. 243 FOR 04.02.2020‘construction’ and ‘purchase of operational vehicles’ as well for Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts. Under this centrally sponsored scheme, the State Governments formulate their State Action Plans(SAPs) based on their strategic priorities and requirements and the Ministry of Home Affairs approves the same with or without modifications. As per General Financial Rules and the guidelines of the scheme, for getting eligible for receiving allocated amount during any given year, State Governments need to furnish Utilization Certificates (UCs) in respect of funds released to it till the year previous to the last financial year.  However, the Government of Jharkhand had not been able to get the full benefit of the scheme during the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 due to pendency of UCs. The details of funds allocated and released to the Government of Jharkhand as well pendency of UCs under the scheme during the last three years and the current year are as below:                   (in Rs. crore)Year	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20*Allocation  	to State Government 	7.39	9.98	8.73	9.21	For release in kind	1.15	1.26	1.24	Nil 	TOTAL	8.54	11.24	9.97	9.21Release 	against allocation	Nil	Nil 	7.74	6.91	for supply in kind	1.15	1.26	1.24	Nil 	other releases	0.49	0.65	0.9342	Nil 	TOTAL	1.64	1.91	9.9142	6.91Amount of pending UCs as on cutoff date	17.89	10.56	2.23	2.13*release position as on 01.02.2020****
