                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.**** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO THE PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 137 RAISED BY SHRI RAVINDRA SHYAM NARAYAN SHUKLA ALIAS RAVI KISHAN AND SHRI RODMAL NAGAR, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 1.7.2019 REGARDING JAWAHAR NAVODAYA VIDYALAYA(a) to (d): 	Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are set up with the object of providing good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. At least 75% seats of the districts are filled by the candidate selected from rural areas. Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each district of the country. 	All the districts of the country (as on 31.5.2014) including all the districts of Madhya Pradesh have been covered under the Navodaya Vidyalaya scheme (except districts in the state of Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the scheme).	Consequent upon carving out of new districts (created upto 31.3.2018), there are 45 districts which are yet to be covered under the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme. The details of these districts are annexed. Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. As such it is not possible to identify the areas where JNVs are likely to be set up in next three years.                                                  *****
