ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)a): Yes, Sir. The Union Government has received a letter dated 19.08.2020 from the Government of Kerala to declare Kannur as an ''interim point of call'' for foreign carriers for a period of six months.(b): Indian carriers are free to mount international flights to/from any point in India including Kannur. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government had also allowed all foreign carriers to bring back Indians from foreign countries to any international airport in India (including Kannur) irrespective of the points of call available to the designated carriers of the country of origin. However, as the Government has established a number of Air Bubble agreements with various countries, the designated carriers are being restricted to the points of call available in the bilateral agreements. However, carriers of countries with whom Air Bubble agreements are not yet established, are still allowed to operate charter flights to any international airport in India (including Kannur).(c) & (d): Airlines are free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate within the ambit of bilateral agreements. It is, therefore, upon the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability.
