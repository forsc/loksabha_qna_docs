ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (f): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country to provide good quality modern education including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family''s socio-economic condition. All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered under this scheme. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. The State-wise/ District-wise details where JNVs have not been sanctioned so far, as on date, are Annexed. The details of the fund allocated to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti during the last year and the current year for operating  existing JNVs and ongoing construction works are as under:-	 	  (Rs. in crore)<pre>Year	Budget Allocated to NVS2020-21 	3480.002021-22 	3800.00 </pre>All the 33 districts of Gujarat have been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme and 34 JNVs have been sanctioned and functional including an additional second JNV in Dahod district        (ST concentrated). All the 38 districts of Bihar have been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme and 39 JNVs have been sanctioned and functional including an additional second JNV in Gaya district (SC concentrated).  *****
