ANSWER




                                                        (a), (d) & (e)	Under the Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) with an objective to train one crore youth in various sectors across the country including State of West Bengal in the four years period i.e. 2016-20. This Scheme enables the youth for taking Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centres (TCs) throughout the country. As on 17.01.2020, 13,209 TCs are empanelled under STT of the scheme across the country including 415 TCs in State of West Bengal.Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-20) has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, Ministry has received proposals from 36 States/UTs and after evaluation of proposals, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 20.18 lakh candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 3,050 Cr. for FY 2016-20. However, due to slow performance of States/UTs and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalised to Rs. 2,419 crore (approx.) with the corresponding physical target of 12.45 lakh. As on 17.01.2020, Rs. 869.06 Cr. (approx) has been disbursed to 36 States/UTs including State of West Bengal.Additionally, the Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training throughout the country. The Ministry through NSDC provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. As on 17.01.2020, 812 PMKKs have been allocated in 707 districts across the country; out of allocated PMKKs, 723 PMKKs have been established including 43 PMKKs in State of West Bengal.(b) and (c)	A skill gap study has been conducted by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), over 2010-2014, with an objective to understand the sectoral and geographical spread of incremental skill requirements across 24 high priority sectors between 2013-17 and 2017-22, which indicates that there is an additional net incremental requirement of 109.73 million skilled manpower by 2022 in twenty four key sectors.
