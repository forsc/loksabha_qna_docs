ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a):	The Government through the Tea Board is implementing Tea Development and Promotion Scheme (TPDS) which provides financial assistance to the tea industry in the country including the tea gardens of West Bengal covering Jalpaiguri District for increasing production and productivity of tea, and welfare measures for tea garden workers and their wards.  Tea Board has disbursed Rs.218.28 Crores in last three financial years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 of which the share of West Bengal was Rs.44.50 crores.  (b):	As per TPDS, there is no provision of extending loans to tea industry or tea growers.(c):	The tea is mostly blended before it is exported, as such the origin (State/UT-wise) is lost in the process. Hence the data pertaining to the export share of the States and UTs are not maintained by the Tea Board.  However, region wise exports (based on the ports in the region) of tea during 2018-19 is given in the following table: Region	Quantity in M.Kgs	Value in Rs Crs	Unit Price in Rs/KgNorth India	152.83	3748.40	245.27South India	101.67	1758.44	172.96All India	254.50	5506.84	216.38Source: Tea Board(d):	At present, there is no such proposal under consideration. ******
