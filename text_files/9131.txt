ANSWER




                                                           THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) Brazil hosted the 11th BRICS Summit in Brasilia on 13-14 November, 2019 under the theme “BRICS: economic growth for an innovative future”. In the 11th BRICS Summit, Indian delegation was led by Prime Minister.(b) At the Summit, the Leaders discussed global financial and security situation, countering terrorism, climate change, sustainable development, reform of the multilateral system, reform of WTO and institutions of international governance, ways to promote Intra-BRICS cooperation including in science & technology, trade, health, information and communication technology, people-to-people exchanges. BRICS Business Council and the New Development Bank also presented their reports to the Leaders at the Summit. Leaders issued a Joint Declaration at the Summit.The broad outcomes of Brazil’s BRICS Chairship in 2019 have been the establishment of innovation BRICS Network (iBRICS) and BRICS Women Business Alliance (WBA), the adoption of the New Architecture on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI), finalisation of Terms of Reference of the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform. In addition, a seminar on BRICS Strategies for Countering Terrorism, a Workshop on Human Milk Banks, and BRICS Meeting on Asset Recovery was also organised. Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among BRICS Trade and Investment Promotion Agencies (TIPAs) was also signed in 2019.(c)	The issues taken up at BRICS Summit are of importance to not only the BRICS countries but also to developing countries in general. The BRICS countries have been the engine of global growth during last few years. At the same time, BRICS has emerged as a major factor for a peaceful, prosperous and multi polar world. Leaders stressed on further promoting Intra BRICS trade, reducing cost of trade between BRICS countries, trade facilitation and cooperation in customs and banking processes.  From inception, finance and trade is a major area of Intra-BRICS Cooperation. The New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) are the major outcomes in this area. NDB has funded/decided to fund 44 projects worth more than USD 12 billion, within BRICS countries including 8 projects worth USD 3246 million in India. (d) 	BRICS has become a platform for discussing and deliberating on the issues of common concern for all developing countries. BRICS countries have regularly called for reform of the multilateral system including United Nations, World Trade Organisation, International Monetary Fund, in order to make them more representative and inclusive. All members of BRICS grouping benefit from its collective strength by way of consultation and cooperation on economic issues of mutual interests, as well as topical global issues, such as, international terrorism, climate change, food and energy security, reforms of global governance institutions, etc.  (e) 	BRICS Chairship rotates among its members annually. Each year, issues of common interest to developing countries are discussed under BRICS such as global financial situation, countering terrorism, anti-corruption reform of the multilateral system, including United Nations, World Trade Organisation, International Monetary Fund. Each Chair introduces its own priorities also during its Chairship. Throughout the year meetings of relevant experts, senior officials, working groups etc. take place to develop a common understanding among BRICS countries. Such meetings are then followed, in some cases, by Ministers’ meeting. BRICS NSAs and Foreign Ministers also meet at regular intervals to discuss issues of mutual interest. The preparations culminate in BRICS Leaders’ Summit wherein Leaders issue a Joint Declaration.  India has ensured that the issue of countering terrorism remains in the BRICS discussions. In past BRICS Leaders have listed the terrorist entities like LeT, JeM, TTP etc. as perpetrators of violence.  In 2019, five subgroups have been set up under Counter Terrorism Working Group and will cover different aspects of countering terrorism.***
