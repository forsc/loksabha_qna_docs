                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	Yes sir. Some of the farmers’ unions have been agitating against newly enacted Farm Acts viz. “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” & “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020”. 	The demands of agitating farmer unions were:-i.	To repeal all three new Farm Acts viz. “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” & “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020”.  ii.	Keeping farmers outside the penalty provision on straw burning under Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 and;iii.	To withdraw the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. iv.	Issue related to procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP)(c) & (d):	 Yes, Sir. Government engaged itself actively and constantly with the agitating farmers unions to end the protests and 11 rounds of negotiating talks were held between the Government & agitating farmer unions to resolve the issues. Details of the meetings are at Annexure-I. Various efforts have been made by Government to end the protests.	Giving top priority to the interest of farmers, Government vide letter dated 09th December, 2020 addressed to Farmer Unions, explained point  by  point,  how  the concerns expressed by the farmers were being taken care of in the proposal of the Government of India.  Government also proposed to constitute a small group consisting of representative of farmers’ unions, who can deliberate on Farm Laws clause-wise in a time bound manner and can also consider other issues related to farmers, which representatives of farmers’ unions have not agreed.	However, Farmer Unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws excepting for demanding their repeal.	Government is always open to discussion with farmers Union and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue. 	Draft of the Ordinances had been circulated to various Ministries/ Departments; NITI Aayog etc. for their comments. State Governments were also consulted through Video Conferencing (VC) on 21st May, 2020, which was attended by the officials of 13 States/ UTs, to obtain feedback on new legal framework facilitating barrier free inter-State and intra-State trade in agriculture produce to provide choice to farmers. Government of India has proactively undertaken efforts on series of extension activities through webinars, online conferences, workshops, teleconferencing, social media, print media, electronic media with the stakeholders on the aforesaid three Ordinances and thereafter on respective Acts. (e) & (f):	 The Government of India has no such record. However, Government of India during discussion with farmers’ Union appealed to them that children and elders especially women should be allowed to go home in view of the cold and COVID situation. Regarding compensation, No Sir, in view of the above.
