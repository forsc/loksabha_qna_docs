ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): Improving the quality of education across all levels from primary to university level isa continuous and ongoing process. Several initiatives are currently being undertaken in thisdirection. The Samagra Shiksha, an integral scheme for School Education as a Centrally SponsoredScheme is being implemented throughout the country with effect from the year 2018-19. Thisprogramme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan(SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha (RSMA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarchingprogramme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims toensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondarylevels.In higher education also, various schemes, namely, Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan(RUSA), Scheme for promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), GlobalInitiative for Academics Network (GIAN), Impacting Research, Innovation & Technology(IMPRINT), Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), Pandit MadanMohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT), Study Webs ofActive-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), National Digital Library, campusconnect programme, Uchhatar Avishkar Abhiyan, Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, Impactful Research inSocial Sciences (IMPRESS), Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA),National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) are being implemented to improve the qualityof higher education. A number of initiatives are also undertaken by UGC and AICTE for qualityimprovement in higher and technical education.(c) to (h): Currently, The Government is in the process of formulating a new National EducationPolicy for meeting the changing dynamics of the population’s requirement with regard to qualityeducation, innovation and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower by equippingits students with the necessary skills and knowledge and to eliminate the shortage of manpower inscience, technology, arts and industry. For this purpose, it carried out a highly participative,inclusive and multi-pronged consultation process, through online, grassroots and thematic expertconsultations. The Committee for the Draft National Education Policy under the Chairmanship ofDr. K. Kasturirangan submitted its report to the Ministry on 31st May 2019. There has been widepublicity and positive feedback from all stakeholders. More than 2 lakhs suggestions and inputshave been received on the Draft National Education Policy, 2019. Accordingly, Ministry is in theprocess of finalizing the National Education Policy, 2020. At this stage, it is premature to highlightthe salient features of the proposed National Education Policy.The requirement of funds would be estimated after finalisation of the Policy. Government iscommitted to implement the Policy by making suitable budgetary allocations.*****
