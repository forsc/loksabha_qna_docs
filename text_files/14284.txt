ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Yes, Sir. Digi Yatra policy has been launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for providing seamless and hassle-free passenger experience at Indian airports, without the need for verification of ticket and ID at multiple touch points. Passengers are to enroll themselves in this programme for a seamless travel experience. Identification & validation of his/her ticket is to be done by a biometric system. Option of manual procedure is also envisaged in this programme. Digi Yatra aims to simplify the passenger processes at various check points in the airport right from the terminal entry gate, check-in/bag drop, security check upto boarding gates. ;(b):  Digi Yatra initiative is at initial stage. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has awarded work for implementation of Biometric Boarding System (BBS) at 4 airports viz, Kolkata, Pune, Vijayawada & Varanasi airports. Also, the scheme is at trial stage at Bengaluru and Hyderabad airports. (c): Does not arise as the Digi Yatra registration is yet to commence.
