The procurement policy is open ended. Under this policy, wheat and paddy offered by farmers, within the stipulated period & conforming to the specifications prescribed by Government of India, are purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by the State Government agencies including Food Corporation of India (FCI) for Central Pool. However, if producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market i.e. to private trader/ anyone. The objective of foodgrains procurement by Government agencies is to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce and do not have to resort to distress sale. It aims to service the NFSA and other welfare schemes of the Government so that subsidised foodgrains are supplied to the poor and needy, and to build up buffer stocks of foodgrains to ensure foodgrain security. There is sufficient stock of Central Pool to meet the requirement of PDS.            .............2/--2-          State-wise, estimate and procurement of Rice and Wheat during each of the last three years and the current year is enclosed as Annexure-I & II respectively.(b): 	No.(c): 	Does not arise in view of (b) above.(d): 	No.(e): 	The following steps are taken to ensure that farmers  get remunerative price for wheat and paddy:i) 	Before the onset of each marketing season, Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India (GOI) holds a consultative meeting with the officials of Food Corporation of India (FCI), State Governments and others to make an assessment of availability of wheat and paddy/rice for procurement at MSP based on the prospects of production and market situation. ii) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. iii) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate the farmers to bring their produce conforming to the specifications. iv) 	Payment for the wheat and paddy procured from farmers is either made directly to the farmers or through arthias/co-operative societies as per prevailing system of the State. Payment to farmers are also made through A/c payee cheque/electronic mode.v) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India (FCI), taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of the farmers. vi) 	FCI and many of the States have developed online procurement systems.  Through online systems, farmers get latest/updated information regarding MSP declared, nearest purchase centre, date on which the farmer has to bring his produce to the purchase centre etc.**** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.574 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 25th JUNE, 2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.Estimate and Procurement of Rice 								Figures in LMT	 (As on 19.06.2019)S.
