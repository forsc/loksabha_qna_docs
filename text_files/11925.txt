Contd…P/2//2//During WATEC 2019, extensive discussions were held on wide range of issues in the water sector covering both agriculture and drinking water, Israel’s unique water management system involving desalination and reuse of waste water.  A Memorandum of Understanding between India and Israel on Water Resources Management and Development Cooperation was signed on 11.11.2016 to enhance cooperation at the national, regional and international levels by collaborating in the areas mutually agreed upon, including techniques in the efficient use of water resources, recycling/re-use of waste water, desalination, aquifer recharge and in-situ water conservation techniques, and water resource management.Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources. Aquifer maps and management plans have been shared with the respective State Government agencies for taking suitable interventions.
