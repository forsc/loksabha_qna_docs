                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a): Between March 2020 and June 2021, the District Courts heard a total of 74,15,989 cases using the digital system. The case disposal status by digital and physical hearing is however not separately maintained. During the same period, a total of 97,21,491 cases were disposed of in all States/UTs by digital and physical hearing. The State/UT wise position is placed at Annexure I.(b) to (d): Disposal of cases is within the domain of the judiciary. However, the Union Government is committed to speedy disposal of cases and reduction in pendency of cases to improve access to justice in line with the mandate under Article 39A of the Constitution. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms, established by the Union Government, has adopted many strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court, reduction in pendency through follow up by Arrears Committees at District, High Court and Supreme Court level, emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) and initiatives to fast track special type of cases.---- Annexure IStatement referred to in reply of part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1446 for 28/07/2021 regarding cases disposed of in all States/UTs.
