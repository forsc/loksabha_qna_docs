The details of the loans approved on the portal are as under:Financial Year (FY)	No of Accounts	Amount (Rs. Crore)2018-19	1,40,518	43,1092019-20	1,04,761	32,8822020-21 (till 31.08.2020)	9,686	3,651(b) to (d) :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permitted a one-time restructuring of loans to MSMEs with an aggregate exposure of up to Rs. 25 crore, that were in default but standard as on January 1, 2019, and continue to be standard as on the date of implementation of restructuring, without an asset classification downgrade, subject to certain conditions. The scheme was extended vide RBI’s circular dated February 11, 2020 for MSME accounts that were in default but standard as on January 1, 2020. In view of the continued need to support viable MSME entities on account of the fallout of Covid-19 pandemic, the scheme has been further extended by RBI to cover loans to MSMEs that were ‘standard’ as on March 1, 2020 vide its circular dated    August 6, 2020. The restructuring window under the revised guidelines has been extended till March 31, 2021 for implementation of the restructuring plan. In addition, on 6th August, 2020, RBI has also provided a window under the “Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019” to enable lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures exceeding Rs. 25 crore,  which were not more than 30 days past due as on 01.03.2020 and where the stress is on account of Covid-19 pandemic, to be invoked not later than 31st December, 2020 and implemented within 180 days thereafter. All Public Sector Banks have so far restructured loans of eligible MSMEs under RBI’s aforesaid one-time restructuring scheme, amounting to Rs. 31,132 crore. State Bank of India has restructured the highest quantum amounting to Rs. 6284 crore. ‘*****’
