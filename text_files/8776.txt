Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), on the receipt of Memorandum from State Governments and in accordance with extant norms and procedures. SDRF/NDRF norms, inter-alia, provide assistance for emergency supply of drinking water in rural and urban areas and also repairs /restoration of drinking water supply damaged infrastructure. During 2019-20 (so far), the State Government of Maharashtra has not submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance in the wake of drought.

Findings of NICRA have led to release of a few drought-tolerant crop varieties.Cont.2/-2-	Government of India has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a water conservation campaign, which is being implemented in two phases in 256 water-stressed districts of the country.

During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India have worked with State and District officials in these districts to promote water conservation and water resource management by focusing on accelerated implementation of five target interventions, viz. water conservation & rainwater harvesting, renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks, reuse and recharge of bore wells, watershed development and intensive afforestation. With this campaign, huge awareness has been generated and various stakeholders have started taking steps for water conservation.	Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, releases funds to States/ UTs under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) approved criteria. During 2019-20, an amount of Rs.690.55 Crore was allocated to the State of Maharashtra and out of this, an amount of Rs.345.28 Crore has been released as first instalment.
