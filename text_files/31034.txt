ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) The Government has received references from Hon’ble Members of Parliament from across the country including North Eastern Region  requesting for release of pending instalments due to them to resume the ongoing works and clear the committed liabilities under MPLADS after the decision of the Government not to operate MPLADS during Financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22. However, the Government has not conducted any survey to assess the impact on local development works in the backward States like North Eastern Region including Assam after the decision of the Government not to operate MPLADS during FY 2020-21 and 2021-22. Further, the Government has approved the restoration of MPLADS during the remaining part of the Financial Year 2021-22 with release of MPLADS fund at the rate of ? 2 crore per Member of Parliament in one instalment; and continuation of MPLADS up to 2025-26 with the annual entitlement per Member of Parliament (MP) at ? 5 crores. (b) and (c) At present, there is no proposal under consideration of the Government to increase the MPLADS funds.                                                   *****
