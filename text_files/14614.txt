ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) & (b): Modernization and improvement of infrastructure of Prasar Bharati (Doordarshan & All India Radio) is a continuous process. These include adoption of modern High Definition (HD) technology, Digitisation of Studios and Transmission Operations, replacement/upgradation of old/outlived equipments, digitised content dissemination and expansion of DTH and TV Channels.    (c) to (e): As a Public Service Broadcaster, Prasar Bharati primarily focusses on AIR & Doordarshan’s programming on issues of public interest viz. health, education, empowerment, social justice, etc. However, it is the constant endeavor of Prasar Bharati to provide impactful and entertaining programmes on AIR & DD to become the preferred channel of choice of people. With the launch of DD Arun Prabha and placing of 11 state specific channels of Doordarshan on DTH platform, footprint of Doordarshan Network has been expanded. Video walls for studio have been introduced for quality content generation from studios. In addition, more than 70 “YouTube” channels have been created by Prasar Bharati to disseminate the audio/video content. Further, more than 200 AIR channels have made available on “NewsOnAir” app on Android and iOS mobile platform.*****
