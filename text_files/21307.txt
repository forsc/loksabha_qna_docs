The works are identified, approved & prioritized by the Gram Sabha at the Gram Panchayat level in each States/UTs including Odisha as per the provision of the Act. Accordingly, the action plan (shelf of work) of the permissible works is prepared & approved by the Gram Sabha and can be taken up as per the demand. The planning of works is done as per the estimated person days to be generated for the work in a financial year at the time of assessment of labour budget. There is no target fixed for any specific work from the Ministry, but are taken up as per the demand and priority of the Gram Panchayat. Hence, no work-wise allocation of funds is made. During current financial year 2020-21, as on 03.03.2021, the Ministry has released Rs. 443697.98 lakh till now to Odisha for implementation of Scheme.
