ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY) (a)  to (f):	    A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. --2--STATEMENT IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (f) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. 292 FOR 16.03.2021(a): A total of 22 languages of India are specified under the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. The details of date on which recognition has been granted to each of the languages included in the Eighth Schedule are as under:-(i) 	14 languages viz. Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu were initially included in the Constitution i.e. on 26 January, 1950.(ii) 	Sindhi language was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution on 10.04.1967. (iii)   Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali languages were included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution on 31.08.1992.(iv)   Bodo, Dogri, Maithili & Santhali languages was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution on 07.01.2004.(b):  Several of these languages are spoken in several States, and their use is not restricted by State boundaries. As per the information received from the Registrar General of India, details of speakers of Scheduled languages as per Census 2011 is available in the public domain on the following link: https://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-4.pdf. A copy of the same is also placed at Annexure.--3--L.S.S.Q.NO. 292 FOR 16.03.2021(c):  As per 2011 Census, Bhojpuri is spoken by 5,05,79,447 numbers of people in India.(d) to (f): There have been demands from time to time for inclusion of Rajasthani and Bhojpuri in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.  As the evolution of dialects and languages is a dynamic process, influenced by socio-cultural, economic and political developments, it is difficult to fix any criterion for languages, whether to distinguish them from dialects, or for inclusion in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The earlier attempts, through the Pahwa (1996) and Sitakant Mohapatra (2003) Committees, to evolve such fixed criteria have been inconclusive. Government of India is conscious of the sentiments and requirements for inclusion of other languages in the Eighth Schedule. Such requests have to be considered keeping in mind these sentiments, and the other relevant considerations. Since at present there are no fixed criteria for any language to be considered for inclusion in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution, no time-frame can be fixed for consideration of the demands for inclusion of more languages in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.*********
