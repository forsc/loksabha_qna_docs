                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)and (b)The Ministry has already initiated preventive measures to address the issues relating to safety of wild animals from various infrastructural development including railway tracks passing through forests. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in consultation with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, National Tiger Conservation Authority, National Highway Authority and World Bank has published a document namely ‘Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of Linear Infrastructure’ which included procedural guidance for  erecting  fences and  walls  to exclude wild animals, constructing  structures such  as overpasses  and underpasses to allow  animals to  cross a road or  railway  corridors safely, and erecting  signage and warning systems to reduce death of wild animals  due to  transportation infrastructure. The Standing Committee of NBWL in its 47th Meeting held on 25th January, 2018  recommended that in future user agencies involved in linear infrastructure  development  should  take into  consideration the advisory made in the guidelines of  the Wildlife Institute of India  while  designing the  linear infrastructures  inside the Protected Areas, notified Eco Sensitive Zone area around PAs.  Further a Permanent Coordination Committee has been constituted between Ministry of Railway (Railway Board) and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for preventing elephant death in train accident.  Also a project namely ‘Application for Advanced Intelligent Seismic Technology for Mitigation Threats to Wild Elephant Population from Railway Tracks’ was sanctioned to Uttarakhand Forest Department and Wildlife Institute of India for mitigation of elephant deaths due to train hits.(c) Reserve Forests are declared by the respective State Governments under the provisions of Indian Forest Act 1927 and State Forest Act. Total number of Reserve Forests in the country is not collated in the Ministry. However, as per the information received from the State Government of Assam, the total number of Reserve Forest in Assam is 312.***
