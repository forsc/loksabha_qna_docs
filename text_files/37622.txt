ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) As per the information available with the Ministry, the number of Indian prisoners, including under-trials, in foreign jails at present is 8278, out of which 156 are serving life sentence. Country-wise list is given at Annexure - I. However, due to strong privacy laws prevailing in many countries, the local authorities do not share information on prisoners unless the person concerned consents to the disclosure of such information. Even countries which share information do not generally provide detailed information about the foreigners imprisoned.(c) & (d) The Government attaches the highest priority to the                  safety, security and well-being of Indians in foreign countries,including those in the foreign jails. Indian Missions / Posts abroadremain vigilant and closely monitor the incidents of Indian nationalsbeing put in jail in foreign countries for violation/ alleged violation of local laws.As soon as the information about the detention/arrest of an Indian national is received by an Indian Mission/Post, it immediately gets in touch with the local Foreign Office and other concerned local authorities to get consular access to the detained/arrested Indian national to ascertain the facts of the case, confirm his Indian nationality and ensure his welfare. Apart from extending them all possible consular assistance, Indian Missions and Posts also assist in providing legal aid wherever needed. Missions and Posts also maintain a local panel of lawyers where Indian community is in sizeable numbers.         The issue of repatriation of Indian nationals in foreign prisons is regularly pursued by Indian Missions and Posts abroad with the local authorities concerned. The Government also follows up this issue during consular and other consultations with other countries, including in the context of bilateral agreements for Transfer of Sentenced Persons [TSP], wherever applicable.          In addition, the Government, through its Missions/Posts abroad and during high level visits, also takes up and pursues grant of amnesty/commutation of sentences of Indian prisoners in foreign countries.(e)	From January, 2020 till February, 2022, 2 Indian nationals have been transferred from Sri Lanka to India, 1 German national has been transferred from India to Germany and 2 Bangladeshi nationals have been transferred from India to Bangladesh under the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003 to serve the remainder of their sentence.***
