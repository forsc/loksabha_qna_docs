ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)  Biodiversity rich forests are considered to be less vulnerable to climate change impacts since different species have different temperature tolerance. Older forests are characterised by high biodiversity, multi-tier vegetation and native vegetation.  (b) & (c) Government of India has published a report titled “Climate Change and India: A 4 x 4 Assessment - A Sectoral and Regional Analysis for the 2030”. This report provides for projections on impacts of climate change on four key sectors of Indian economy namely, Agriculture, Water, Natural Ecosystems and Biodiversity, and Health in four climate sensitive regions of India namely, the Himalayan region, the Western Ghats, the Coastal Areas and the North-East Region. The report projects variable impacts in terms of composition of forests and net primary productivity. (d)  Government of India is implementing afforestation programmes under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as Green India Mission (GIM) under National Action Plan on Climate Change and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) to increase the forest/green cover in the country. Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) and Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) as per the schemes/plans of States/Union Territories.*****
