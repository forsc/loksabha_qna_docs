ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and  (b):No, Sir.Aadhaar is the most important identity authentication platform used in India. The Aadhaar authenticates every resident of India who has voluntary enrolled into Aadhaar.  It identity is not restricted to the citizens of the country.  Any resident of India or a non resident Indian (NRI, holding a valid Indian Passport), can enroll to obtain Aadhaar Card. “Resident” means an individual who has resided in India for a period or periods amounting in all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment. Currently UIDAI has enrolled over or more than 93% of the overall population (projected population 2021). The saturation report as on 31st December 2021 attached as Annexure-I. The enrolment for Aadhaar is an ongoing process.  Considering the new birth of children every year and left out population of other age group, the requirement for new enrolment for Aadhaar is a continuous process.(c):No, Sir. The Aadhaar saturation has reached 93% of the overall population (projected population 2021) as on today. The Aadhaar saturation amongst adult (> 18 years of age) has reached 99.82%. Accordingly, the requirement of Aadhaar related services has shifted to various updations (viz. name, address, date of birth, mobile number etc.) in existing Aadhaar and new enrolment of left out population, especially of children.  (d) to (e):The Government has taken the following initiatives to deal with the enrollment as well as updation in Aadhaar:  i.	At present, more than 52,000 Aadhaar centres run by various Banks, Post Offices, State Governments, CSC e-Gov etc. are functional across the country. There has been a substantial increase in the number of functional Aadhaar centres from 41,000 during the pre-COVID level of February 2020 to the present level. ii.	Residents who have linked their mobile number with Aadhaar can update their demographic details (i.e. name, address, gender and date of birth) online through myAadhaar portal from the convenience of their homes.iii.	In order to maximize the facility for updating mobile number in Aadhaar, UIDAI has onboarded India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) as Registrar, with target to onboard more than 1 Lakh postmen equipped with tablet/ mobile based devices to facilitate mobile and email update facility in Aadhaar. Once the mobile number is updated, residents can update their demographic details in Aadhaar online through myAadhaar portal. These IPPB operators will also do Aadhaar enrolment of children in the age group of 0-5 years.******* Annexure-IState/UT wise Aadhaar Saturation                                                                                                                                      31-Dec-21S.No	State Name	Total Population(Projected 2021)*	Numbers of  Aadhaar  assigned (LIVE)	Saturation %(LIVE)1	A & N Islands	                           4,00,000 	3,90,034	97.51%2	Andhra Pradesh	                     5,27,87,000 	5,14,48,812	97.46%3	Arunachal Pradesh	                        15,33,000 	12,51,110	81.61%4	Assam	                     3,50,43,000 	2,80,96,218	80.18%5	Bihar	                  12,30,83,000 	10,60,35,286	86.15%6	Chandigarh	                        12,08,000 	11,49,013	95.12%7	Chhattisgarh	                     2,94,93,000 	2,77,56,729	94.11%8	Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu**	                           6,38,399 	5,98,182	93.70%9	Delhi	                     2,05,71,000 	2,22,73,828	108.28%10	Goa	                        15,59,000 	15,97,064	102.44%11	Gujarat	                     6,97,88,000 	6,41,29,370	91.89%12	Haryana	                     2,94,83,000 	2,97,14,800	100.79%13	Himachal Pradesh	                        73,94,000 	76,65,329	103.67%14	Jammu Kashmir	                     1,34,08,000 	1,14,16,877	85.15%15	Jharkhand	                     3,84,71,000 	3,51,80,942	91.45%16	Karnataka	                     6,68,45,000 	6,35,56,616	95.08%17	Kerala	                     3,54,89,000 	3,68,26,246	103.77%18	Ladakh	                           2,97,000 	2,32,993	78.45%19	Lakshadweep	                              68,000 	72,973	107.31%20	Madhya Pradesh	                     8,45,16,000 	7,61,00,387	90.04%21	Maharashtra	                  12,44,37,000 	11,61,30,271	93.32%22	Manipur	                        31,65,000 	25,60,932	80.91%23	Meghalaya	                        32,88,000 	18,49,789	56.26%24	Mizoram	                        12,16,000 	11,51,302	94.68%25	Nagaland	                        21,92,000 	13,27,729	60.57%26	Odisha	                     4,40,33,000 	4,30,91,402	97.86%27	Puducherry	                        15,72,000 	12,89,942	82.06%28	Punjab	                     3,03,39,000 	3,07,55,530	101.37%29	Rajasthan	                     7,92,81,000 	7,31,09,422	92.22%30	Sikkim	                           6,77,000 	5,77,717	85.33%31	Tamil Nadu	                     7,64,02,000 	7,32,21,267	95.84%32	Telangana	                     3,77,25,000 	3,80,38,128	100.83%33	Tripura	                        40,71,000 	37,35,127	91.75%34	Uttar Pradesh	                  23,09,07,000 	21,04,73,772	91.15%35	Uttarakhand	                     1,13,99,000 	1,12,89,680	99.04%36	West Bengal	                     9,81,25,000 	9,32,70,039	95.05%TOTAL	1,36,09,03,399	1,26,73,64,857	93.13% 	*As per RGI data**The revised population updated as received from UT administration office of DD and DNH vide letter COL/Aadhaar-Awareness/2021-22/3060 dated 02 Nov 21 	   	 	 ********
