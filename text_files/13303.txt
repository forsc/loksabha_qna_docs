                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a):	Geographical Indications are registered as per the time frame stipulated by Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999 & Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Rules, 2002.An applicant has to comply with the necessary legal requirements mentioned in the GI Act & Rules. When, the applicant complies with the requirements as stipulated in the GI Act and Rules, GI Registrations are granted within the time frame of 12 to 18 months on an average. Since GI applications are related to traditional handicrafts/agricultural products, the applicant has to collect necessary documents and technical reports in order to establish historical reputation and geographical uniqueness. This takes time for compliance on the part of applicant, thereby delaying the overall registration process. (b):	As on 24.02.2020, a total of 362 GI Applications have been registered, out of which 347 are Indian GI Applications (318 – Indian GI Products & 29 GI Logo Applications) and remaining 15 GIs have been registered for Foreign GI Applications. Breakup of State wise GI Applications Registered as on 02.03.2020 is enclosed as Annexure.*******
