                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) and (b): With regard to identification of wilful corporate defaulters of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and the details of names of individual corporate and companies with their pending dues, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has apprised that under the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) database, banks report certain credit information of all borrowers who are having aggregate fund-based and non-fund based exposure of Rs. 5 crore and above. RBI has further apprised that as a part of CRILC, from February 2019, banks have an option to flag whether a borrower is wilful defaulter or not. Information on the list of borrowers flagged as wilful defaulter by the reporting entities with their funded advances outstanding and amount prudentially / technically written-off in CRILC as on 30.9.2019, as reported by PSBs, furnished by RBI, is at Annex.(c): A number of initiatives have been taken by the Government to recover dues from the defaulters include, inter-alia, the following:(1)	PSBs have been asked to examine all accounts exceeding Rs. 50 crore, if classified as Non-Performing Asset (NPA), from the angle of possible fraud and to immediately initiate examination of the issue of wilful default once a fraud is reported.(2)	Wilful defaulters have been acted against comprehensively. As per data reported by PSBs, till 30.9.2019, suits for recovery have been filed in 9,675 cases. In cases involving secured assets, action under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 has been initiated in 7,698 cases. Further, in accordance with Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s instructions of initiation of criminal proceedings wherever necessary, FIRs have been registered in 3,281 cases.(3)	To deter wilful defaulters, as per RBI instructions, wilful defaulters are not sanctioned any additional facilities by banks or financial institutions, and their unit is debarred from floating new ventures for five years. Further, vide Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2016, wilful defaulters and companies with wilful defaulters as promoters/directors have been debarred from accessing capital markets to raise funds. In addition, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has debarred wilful defaulters from participating in the insolvency resolution process.(4)	For effective action against wilful defaulters fleeing Indian jurisdiction, the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has been enacted to provide for attachment and confiscation of property of fugitive offenders and has disentitled them from defending any civil claim.(5)	Government has advised PSBs to decide on publishing photographs of wilful defaulters, in terms of RBI’s instructions and as per their Board-approved policy.(6)	Government has advised PSBs to obtain certified copy of the passport of the promoters/directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing loan facilities of more than Rs. 50 crore.(7)	Heads of PSBs have been empowered to request for issue of Look Out Circulars.*****
