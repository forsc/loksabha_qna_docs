A committee headed by CEO, NITI Aayog comprising of members from Department of Commerce and Ministry of Finance had reviewed the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) in 2019. The main recommendation of the Committee was that a scheme to refund currently un-rebated Central, State and Local Taxes on inputs consumed in manufacturing exported products should be launched, consistent with the globally acceptable and World Trade Organization (WTO) compatible principle that exports should be zero rated. (b)	 to (d): The value of scrips issued under MEIS during last three years and current year is as under:-Financial Year	Value of MEIS Scrips issued(in Rs Crores)2017-18	26837.972018-19	39724.372019-20	39530.452020-21*	15452.83 (*as on 26.02.2021)The outgo under MEIS has increased over these years largely due to: i.	Increase in coverage of HS lines under the Scheme from about 5000 lines in 2015-16 to about 7500 lines from FY 2017-18 onwards.ii.	For more than 2250 HS lines, rates under MEIS were increased during FY 2017-18.iii.	Introduction of online processing from 2018-19 in place of manual procedure earlier. MEIS has been discontinued with effect from 01.01.2021.                                                                      ****
