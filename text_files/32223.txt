ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The State-wise and District-wise number of India International skill Centres (IISCs) established is given in the Annexure.(b)	Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) like Empower Pragati Vocational and Staffing Private Ltd., Funfirst Global Skillers Private Limited, Justrojgar India Private Limited, Overseas Manpower Company Andhra Pradesh Limited, Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation, Telangana Overseas Manpower Company and Orion Secure have been empaneled as IISCs by NSDC to facilitate international workforce mobility.(c)	Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)  has signed  MoUs/agreements with Germany, Japan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, China, Qatar, Belarus, Switzerland, France, Denmark and  Australia  for  skill development and overseas employment.(d)	The IISCs are private entities which provide various IT enabled services including technical training and Pre- Departure Orientation Training (PDOT). Enrolment in IISCs is market driven and is determined by global workforce supply and demand dynamics.(e)	To provide training and certification benchmarked to international standards to Indians aspiring to work overseas, a pilot project was conducted wherein 14 IISCs were launched, 583 candidates trained, 286 candidates certified, 63 placed overseas. Under the pilot phase, 160 Hour PDOT was provided under Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PKVY) guidelines through partnership between MSDE and Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Based on the learnings of the pilot program, NSDC has initiated a fee based model called the IISC Network for re-skilling and up skilling of workers seeking employment abroad. It comprises of Member Organizations operating through several fixed centers to be referred as IISCs. As of date, 100 organizations are part of the network operating through 557 IISCs across more than 300 trades. The top 5 sectors (based on the number of training centres) are Construction, Electronics, Retail, Tourism and Hospitality and Healthcare. The IISCs cover 68 % of top 50 migrating districts. IISCs are private entities that conduct their own enrolment process. In respect of UAE, 133 candidates were assessed on mutually recognised qualifications. 63 candidates were interviewed and selected by the UAE employer out of which 18 candidates were deployed in UAE. 16 certified candidates deployment is currently on hold due to COVID related travel ban since mid March 2020. In respect of KSA, pilot program for 100 workers was conducted and RPL assessment has been undertaken out of which 81 candidates have successfully cleared the assessment and were issued joint certification in February 2020. Enrolment in these IISC centres is market driven.(f)	The Union Budget 2021 in its para 124 states: “The Government proposes to amend the Apprenticeship Act with a view to further enhancing apprenticeship opportunities for our youth” Accordingly, the ministry presently is in consultation with various stakeholders following which the draft amendments would be finalized.
