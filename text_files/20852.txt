ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): The National Education Policy 2020 envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high-quality education to all, innovation and research and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge. The Policy envisages that the curriculum and pedagogy of our institutions must develop among the students a deep sense of respect towards the Fundamental Duties and Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and a conscious awareness of one’s roles and responsibilities in a changing world. The vision of the Policy is to instill among the learners a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen. (c): National Education Policy 2020 envisions a comprehensive approach to transforming the quality and quantity of research in India. This includes inter-alia promoting research in universities, the inclusion of research and internships in the undergraduate curriculum, faculty career management systems that give due weightage to research, and the governance and regulatory changes that encourage an environment of research and innovation. All of these aspects are extremely critical for developing a research mindset in the country. To build on these various elements in a synergistic manner, and to thereby truly grow and catalyze quality research in the nation, this policy envisions the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF). The overarching goal of the NRF is to enable a culture of research to permeate through our universities. In particular, the NRF may provide a reliable base of merit-based but equitable peer-reviewed research funding, helping to develop a culture of research in the country through suitable incentives for and recognition of outstanding research, and by undertaking major initiatives to seed and grow research at State Universities and other public institutions where research capability is currently limited. Accordingly, Budget 2021-22 proposes NRF outlay to be Rs. 50,000 Crore, over 5 years to ensure the overall research ecosystem of the country is strengthened with focus on identified national priority thrust areas.(d): Central Universities and Colleges are adopting various measures to address faculty shortages in order to ensure that studies of students are not affected which inter-alia, includes engaging research scholars, contract, re-employed, adjunct and visiting faculty. Further the SWAYAM and SWAYAM PRABHA platform are available which help students get world class experience from faculties of IITs and CUs. The institutions publish a year round rolling advertisement to attract faculty. Intensive efforts are being made to attract talented, bright and qualified young men and women to college and University jobs. The entry point incentives have been substantially increased. The UGC Regulations, 2018 has prescribed norms for improvement in service conditions for the new entrant, in terms of better working and leave conditions, career advancement prospects, retirement benefits etc. University Grants Commission (UGC) vide its letters dated 04.06.2019, 31.07.2019, 07.08.2019, 05.09.2019 and 22.10.2019 has already issued directions to higher education institutes to fill up the vacant posts.*******
