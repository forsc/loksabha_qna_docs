                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a)  As per the information received from the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), instances of sale of formalin laced fish have come to notice of FSSAI. Some of the State Governments /UTs including Goa, had issued prohibition orders banning sale and import of formalin laced fish.  (b) There is no report on use of other chemicals/preservative for preserving fish.(c) As per the report of WHO (WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2001), the range of formaldehyde occurs in fish is about 6-20 mg/kg. Besides, the Scientific Panel for Fish and Fisheries Products of FSSAI has fixed an Adhoc limit of naturally occurring formaldehyde in fresh and brackish/marine water fishes as 4.0 PPM and 100 PPM respectively.(d) 	The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, do not permit the use of formaldehyde or formalin in any form including as preservative and/or additive in fish. The enforcement of this Act and its Rules and Regulations primarily lies with State Governments and UTs. To ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food to the consumers, regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products including fish and fishery products are being carried out by the Officers of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to ensure compliance of the standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. In cases where the food samples including fish and fishery products are found to be non-conforming to the notified standards, penal action has been initiated against the defaulting Food Business Operators under the provisions of specified under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.  *****
