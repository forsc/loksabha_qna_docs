Under National Health Mission, financial support is provided to the States and UTs for effective implementation of interventions under AMB strategy based on proposals submitted through their respective annual Programme Implementation Plan (PIP). Sufficient funds are made available to the States/UTs for carrying out activities pertaining to reduction of anaemia.(f)   Lymphatic Filariasis is a vector borne disease endemic in 328 districts of 20 States /Union Territories. The control of Lymphatic Filariasis is implemented through the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. •	The Government of India has taken various initiatives to ensure empowerment of women and girls through their social, educational, economic and political upliftment. Various schemes and programmes are implemented by the Government to make them self-reliant and minimize their dependency on others, such as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY),Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme,One Stop Centre (OSC) and Universalisation of Women Helpline, Swadhar Greh Scheme,Ujjawala Scheme,Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK).•	The Government of India has also decided to implement the Umbrella Scheme for Safety, Security and Empowerment of Women as an integrated women empowerment program under the name ‘Mission Shakti’, for addressing the issues of women on a life-cycle continuum basis and for making them equal partners in nation-building through convergence at different levels of governance and a participative approach.
