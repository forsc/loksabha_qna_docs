ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d) 50 new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) were sanctioned by the Govt. of India inMarch, 2019. Opening of KVs is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of newKVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of theGovernment of India / State Governments / Union Territories Administrations therebycommitting resources for setting up a new KV as well as the availability of necessarysanction of the Government. The proposals received from various sponsoringauthorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposalsunder the “Challenge Method”. One KV in Bhavnagar is already functioning since1997.Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that it has not received anyproposal, in the prescribed performae from the State Government of Gujarat foropening of another KV at Bhavnagar in Gujarat.******
