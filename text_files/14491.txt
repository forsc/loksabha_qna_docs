Since 2014-15 till date, a total amount of Rs.4224.98 crore has been released by the Government of India to Rajasthan under SBM(G), and the State has utilized Rs.3997.24 crore as per the Utilisation Certificates received.  (c) 	SBM(G) is a demand driven scheme, hence fixed State/district-wise targets are not set under this scheme.  However, as per the data reported by the State on the online Integrated Management Information System maintained by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, 83,83,714 individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed in Rajasthan under SBM(G) from 2.10.2014 to 06.03.2020, and all the 42,860 villages of the State have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF).

Of this Rs.52,497 crore will be allocated from the budgetary provision of Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the State Governments and the remaining amount will be dovetailed from different sources such as from the 15th Finance Commission tied grants to rural local bodies for sanitation and water, convergence with MGNREGS and other schemes of Central/State Governments, and revenue generation models particularly for solid and liquid waste management.(f) 	Phase II of SBM(G) will also be implemented in all the villages of the country including all the districts of Rajasthan.
