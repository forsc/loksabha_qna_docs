ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) No specific evidences of constant decline in production of phytoplankton biomass  along the east cost of India has been reported. It fluctuates depending upon the concentrations of nutrients, turbidity, and other physico-chemical constitutions in the coastal waters. Physico- chemical and biological parameters are monitored under “Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System” programme of Ministry of Earth Sciences for the past 25 years and periodically data of phytoplankton diversity is collected.  Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has initiated to reduce the use of land-based nitrogen and their transport to coastal waters by adopting a resolution in the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-4) on sustainable Nitrogen Management in March 2019. Further, MoEF&CC is implementing the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2019 that prohibit the discharge of untreated waste water and effluents into the coast. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has prescribed Primary Water Quality Criteria (dissolved oxygen, bacteria and heavy metals) for the safe discharge of treated wastes into the coastal waters, to ensure that the plankton productivity and thereby the fishery resources in the coastal and marine areas remain unaffected.******
