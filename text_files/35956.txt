ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS (SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a):	 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics reported to it by the States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its annual publication “Prison Statistics India”. The latest published report is of the year 2020. State/UT-wise number of undertrial prisoners in the jails of the country and the number of prisoners to whom legal aid was provided during the year 2020 are given in Annexure.(b) to (d):	‘Prisons’/‘persons detained therein’ is a ‘State’ subject under Entry 4 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Administration and management of prisoners is the responsibility of State Governments, who are competent to take appropriate steps for providing legal assistance to undertrial prisoners. State Legal Services Authorities have established Legal Service Clinics in jails for providing free legal assistance to persons in need. There are about 1091 Legal Service Clinics in jails which are operated by Empanelled Legal Services Advocates and trained Para-Legal Volunteers. Such clinics have been opened in jails to ensure that no prisoner remains unrepresented and legal aid and advice is provided to the prisoners. For easing and expediting the justice process, Video Conferencing facility has also been enabled between 3240 court complexes and 1272 corresponding jails. National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), along with other Legal Services Institutions, undertakes various awareness activities in order to make people aware of their rights and about the role, activities and functioning of the legal services institutions. This includes, conducting seminars, lectures; distribution of pamphlets, broadcasting jingles, etc. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also issued several advisories       to  States  and  UTs  for  adopting  appropriate  measures  to  provide legal assistance to undertrial prisoners. The Model Prison Manual 2016 circulated to all States and UTs has a Chapter on ‘Legal Aid’ which provides the details of facilities which may be provided to undertrial inmates, viz. legal defence, interview with lawyer, application to Courts for legal aid at Government cost etc.*****
