ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Price of agricultural produce tends to fall after the harvesting season due to increase in market arrival of new crop in a lumpy manner. The Government has fixed the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for copra (milling) and copra (ball) at Rs. 9521/quintal and Rs. 9920/quintal respectively for the calendar year 2019.  The wholesale prices of copra are more or less close to the level of MSPs. A statement showing market-wise wholesale prices of copra in Kerala is given at Annexure.(c) & (d):	The Government launched Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA) which provides for a holistic arrangement for assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers /farmers to increase agriculture production and productivity. This umbrella Scheme comprises Price Support Scheme (PSS) for pulses & oilseeds, Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) for oilseeds to ensure MSP to the farmers.The oilseeds producing states have the option to roll out PPSS on pilot basis in district / selected Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) of district involving the participation of private stockist. The pilot district / selected APMC(s) of district will cover one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is notified. This is akin to PSS and it involves physical procurement of the notified oilseeds. The Government of Kerala has submitted proposal for procurement of copra at MSP under Price Support Scheme (PSS) during 2019 season. The said proposal received from Government of Kerala is not in pursuance with the extant PSS guidelines, 2018. Therefore, Government of Kerala have been requested to provide the requisite information for further processing of the proposal, which is still awaited from them.
