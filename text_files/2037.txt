ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): The details of quantity of coal allocated to the State Nominated Agencies (SNAs), notified by the concerned States, by Coal India Limited (CIL) for the current year 2019-20 (up to 27.06.2019) and the quantity of coal supplied against this allocation is as under: (Fig in Lakh Tonnes (Provisional))State	State Nominated Agencies (SNAs)	Earmarked Quantity	StateRecommendation	AllocatedQuantity	LiftingChattisgarh	Chattisgarh State Industrial Development CorporationLimited	3.46	1.00	1.00	0.17Gujarat	Gujarat Coal Coke Traders & Consumers Association	2.16	2.16	1.16	0.00	Kathiyawad Coal & CokeConsumers & TradersAssociation			1.00	0.00Jharkhand	Jharkhand State MineralDevelopment CorporationLimited	8.25	6.00	6.00	0.60Maharashtra	Maharastra State MiningCorporation	7.26	7.26	7.26	0.31MadhyaPradesh	Madhya Pradesh LaghuUdyog Nigam Ltd.	6.67	4.33	4.33	0.00Manipur	Consumers Affair,Food and Public DistributionDepartment	7.00	7.00	7.00	0.00Punjab	Punjab Small Industries &Export Corp.

Co-operative Federation Limited	11.39	6.83	6.83	0.00West Bengal	West Bengal MineralDevelopment TradingCorporation Ltd.	3.14	1.20	1.20	0.16 (b)to(f): The New Coal Distribution Policy, 2007 (NCDP, 2007), provided for distribution of coal to those units/consumers in small and medium sector across the country whose requirement was less than 4,200 tonnes per annum and were otherwise not having any access to purchase coal or concluded Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) for coal supply with coal companies. The earmarked coal quantity would be distributed through State Nominated Agencies (SNAs) notified by the State Governments. This provision of the NCDP, 2007 has been amended on 27.09.2016 by which the annual cap of 4,200 tonnes per annum for sale through SNAs has been increased to 10,000 tonnes per annum and the phrase of small and medium sector as mentioned in NCDP, 2007 has been amended as small, medium and others. Accordingly, Coal India Limited (CIL) allocates coal to SNAs for distribution to small, medium and other consumers, whose annual requirement is less than 10,000 tonnes, based on the recommendation received from the concerned department of State Governments/Utilities. The quantity earmarked for distribution to SNAs is 8 Million Tonnes (MT) annually. The SNA so notified by the State Government is required to enter into FSA with the coal company. The SNAs would be free to devise their own distribution mechanism which inspires public confidence and results in coal distribution in a transparent manner.Further, the request of the State Governments for any additional allocation in favour of the SNA is also taken into consideration by CIL based on the availability of coal. However, the overall allocation to the SNAs is within the 8 MT basket earmarked under NCDP.***
