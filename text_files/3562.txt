                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) As per National Health Profile 2018, total 23582 Government Hospitals are in the country out of which 4635 hospitals are in Uttar Pradesh. State/UT wise details of Government hospitals providing In Patient Care (IPD) services is given at Annexure – I. The data in respect of number of doctors appointed in each hospital is not maintained centrally. However, as per National Health Profile 2018, there are a total 10,41,395 allopathic doctors registered with Medical Council of India/State Medical Council up to 2017 out of which 71,480 doctors are registered with State Medical Council of Uttar Pradesh. Details of State/UT wise number of doctors is given at Annexure – II. (b) to (e) Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide healthcare facilities to its citizens lies with the State Governments.  Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for insourcing or engagement of doctors, specialist doctors and other staff on contractual basis and to improve other facilities in Government hospitals as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS),  based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. However, Government has taken various remedial steps to increase number of doctors and Specialists in the country. These steps include:(i) The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anaesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry in all medical colleges across the country. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor in MD/MS courses has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Associate Prof. from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Associate Prof. is a unit head. (ii) Strengthening/upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats.(iii) Establishment of New Medical Colleges by upgrading district/referral hospitals preferably in underserved districts of the country.(iv) Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats etc.(v) Also, in order to encourage doctors to work in remote and difficult areas, the Medical Council of India, with the previous approval of Central Government, has amended the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 to provide:•	50% reservation in Post Graduate Diploma Courses for Medical Officers in the Government service, who have served for at least three years in remote and difficult areas; and•	Incentive at the rate of 10% the marks obtained for each year in service in remote or difficult areas as upto the maximum of 30% of the marks obtained in the entrance test for admissions in Post Graduate Medical Courses. Further, Under NHM, States are also encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialists for public health facilities. These include various mechanisms for ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services, methods of engaging specialists outside the government system for service delivery at public facilities. States have also been allowed to offer negotiable salaries to attract Specialists including flexibility in strategies such as ''You quote, we pay".  Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc to engaged human resources to address the issue of shortage of doctors and specialists in the public health facilities. Support is also provided to States/UTs in term of hard area allowance for specialist doctors who serve in rural and remote areas as well as for residential quarters for them.Also, States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting and transfer, and ensure rational deployment of doctors. As the posts required for health facilities are filled up by respective State/UT Governments, they are impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts.The information in respect of number of patients/children died due to lack of doctors and other health facilities in Government hospitals in the country is not maintained centrally.
