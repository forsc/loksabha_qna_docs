(e) & (f):     Assistance/subsidy under the scheme are reviewed/revised while seeking extension for implementation of the scheme from the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) under Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India. MIDH in its current form, wherein all the different   horticultural   missions/schemes were subsumed under it, was launched in April, 2014 till the expiry of 12th Five year plan period i.e. upto 31.03.2017. The scheme was further approved for continuation till 31.3.2022, without any change in the cost norms.         MIDH scheme as part of Krishonnati Yojna has now been extended for implementation till September 2022 with existing cost norms.(g):     The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources such as creating Corpus Funds like Micro Irrigation Fund etc. There have been several reforms to unleash the potential, e.g. Formation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs along with necessary financial support under Atma Nirbhar Package (Agriculture). Under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), a component called “Innovation and Agri-Entrepreneurship Development” was launched in 2018-19 with an objective to promote innovation and agri-entrepreneurship by providing financial support and nurturing the incubation ecosystem for encouraging start-ups. Under Atma Nirbhar Bharat special attention is being paid for creation of infrastructure for which “Agri Infrastructure Fund (AIF) has been created with a size of Rs. 100,000 crore. Other special initiatives include Supplementary Income transfers under PM-KISAN; Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY); Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY); Increase in Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif & Rabi Crops ensuring a minimum of 50 percent of profit margin on the cost of production, Bee-Keeping; Rashtriya Gokul Mission; Blue Revolution; Interest Subvention Scheme; Kisan Credit Card (KCC) that now offers production loan to even dairy  & fishery farmers besides agricultural crops etc. The adoption of Drone technologies in agriculture has a potential to revolutionize the Indian agriculture and ensure country’s food security. In order to make Drone technology affordable to the farmers and other stakeholders of this sector, financial assistance @ 100 % cost of drone together with the contingent expenditure is extended to ICAR/SAU/ State governments/ State government Institutions under Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) for its demonstration on the farmer’s fields.******
