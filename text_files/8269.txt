                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)		(a) and (d):There are a number of schemes being implemented by various Ministries of the Government of India for providing assistance to widows, deserted and abandoned women. This Ministry implements 2 schemes for widow, deserted and abandoned women in the country which are centrally sponsored schemes. Details of the schemes are as under: i.	Swadhar Greh Scheme: The Ministry of Women and Child Development implements Swadhar Greh Scheme which envisions a supportive institutional framework for women victims of difficult circumstances so that they could lead their life with dignity and conviction.  It envisages that shelter, food, clothing and health as well as economic and social security are assured for such women. It also envisions that the special needs of these women are properly taken care of and under no circumstances they should be left unattended or abandoned which could lead to their exploitation and desolation.   ii.	Ujjawala: It is a comprehensive scheme implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development which includes five components viz., prevention of trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation to facilitate rescue, rehabilitate and re-integrate victims in family and society as well as repatriate them across border, if needed. In the protective and rehabilitative homes under the scheme  basic amenities such food, clothing and other items of personal use, medical care, legal aid etc. are provided to the victims.      Along with the above the Ministry, as a special case, has set up a Home for Widows at Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh with a capacity of 1,000 widows to provide a safe and secure place of stay, health services, nutritious food, legal and counseling services.  The schemes of other Ministries include:iii.	Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS): Widow pension is provided under this scheme to the widows belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) only and is the component of National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP).  A monthly central assistance of Rs. 300 is provided to the BPL widows of age-group 40-79 years and Rs. 500 is provided to the widows of age of 80 or higher. iv.	Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY-G)aims to provide  ‘’Housing for All” through provision of pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2022. This will also benefit women.v.	Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY-U) addresses the housing requirement of the urban poor through four programme verticals viz. “In-situ’’ Slum Redevelopment, Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme, Affordable Housing in Partnership with public or private sector and Beneficiary-led individual house construction/enhancements. This will also benefit women.vi.	Atal Pension Yojana (APY) has an objective of creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especiallythe poor, the under privileged and workers in the unorganised sector. The scheme is open to all citizens of India between 18-40 years of age having a saving bank account in a bank or post office.(c) and (d): As per the information provided by the Ministry of Rural Development, the guidelines of NSAP state that cap/ceiling of the beneficiaries communicated to the States/UTs are on the basis of BPL ratios of respective States/UTs and identification of beneficiaries, sanction and disbursement of benefit under the schemes is entrusted to States/UTs.  No instance, where eligible widows are not covered under ICNWPS, after fulfilling the criteria of the scheme, as prescribed in the guidelines of NSAP, has come to the notice.  ********
