                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? (???? ??? ??????)  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a):	No Sir. The VIII edition of the International Intellectual Property Index (IIPI) was released by U.S Chamber of Commerce Global innovation Policy Centre (GIPC), on February 5, 2020 subsequent to which no further edition has been released. (b):	As per the VIII Edition, the International Intellectual Property Index (IIPI) has mapped the Intellectual Property Ecosystem in 53 Global economies. The index evaluates the Intellectual Property framework in each economy across 50 indicators spread across 9 categories.(c):  	As per the VIII edition India was ranked 40th out of a total of 53 countries, as against 36th in 50 countries assessed in 2019. While India ranked the very last out of all the countries initially in 2012, it has improved its rank gradually, indicating a consistent improvement in India’s IPR regime according to the report. Other rankings like global innovation index also showcase India’s prowess in innovation and IP where India’s rank improved to 48 in 2020 as against 81 in 2015.India’s ranking of IIPI for the last few years is as under:<pre>Edition	Year	India’s Rank	No. of CountriesVIII	2020	40	53VII	2019	36	50VI	2018	44	50V	2017	43	45IV	2016	37	38III	2015	29	30II	2014	25	25I	2012	11	11</pre>India’s overall score has increased from 36.04 (16.22 out of 45) in the VII edition, to 38.46 (19.23 out of 50) in the VIII edition. India’s score on IP indicators improved from 16.22 (36.04%) to 19.23 in existing indicators which indicates improvement in India’s IP ecosystem. Three out of five indicators added recently are international treaties to which India has not become member; hence it has not been scored against them. (d): 	Government of India has undertaken various steps to support investments in innovation and creativity through robust the IPR regime and enforcement in the country. Some of recent steps taken are:-	The facility of Expedited Examination has been provided for patent applications filed by Start-ups and for applications where the Applicant has selected Indian Patent office as ISA/IPEA for his PCT application. In the year 2019, Expedited Examination system has been extended for patent applications filed by small entities and other seven more categories of applicants.-	Design Amendment Rules, 2021 was notified in the Gazette of India on 25.01.2021 wherein provision has been made for 80% reduction in fee for  startups and small entities/MSMEs to bring them at par with natural persons.  This would incentivize MSMEs and startups to file for industrial designs.-	The scheme for facilitating Start-ups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP) launched for encouraging innovation and creativity of start-ups wherein start-up entities can avail reimbursement for fee to be paid to facilitators while filing their patent applications, has been extended up to 31st March, 2023. -	Further, to simplify the patent prosecution process for the foreign and domestic companies who have filed their inventions in India, statement of working submitted in the Form 27 has been simplified whereby a single form can be filled for related patent applications.-	On enforcement front several initiatives have been taken to further strengthen the IPR regime in India.  Apart from creating awareness among general public, more than hundred sensitization programs have been carried out with Police, Customs and Judiciary.  DPIIT has developed various resources such as IPR Enforcement Toolkit for Police and a booklet on Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - “A-Z of Intellectual Property Rights”. Further to counter online piracy, CIPAM collaborated with National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) and Maharashtra Cyber and Digital Crime Unit (MCDCU), to suspend over 380 infringing websites on the basis of incomplete KYC (or WHOIS norms).(e): 	Awareness in IPR: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) through Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) and in collaboration with the office of CGPDTM is regularly engaged in dissemination of information and knowledge to IP stakeholders by way of participation in awareness activities in IPR, conducted for schools, universities, industries, legal and enforcement agencies and other stakeholders in collaboration with industry Associations in the country. IPO officials regularly participate as resource persons in these programmes. The details of IPR Awareness workshops/ seminars conducted are as under:-<pre>S. No.	Target Group	2017-2018	2018-2019	2019-2020	2020-2021  (till date)1.	CIPAM - Academic Institutions (Schools, Colleges, Universities)	78	653	300	952.	IP training and sensitization programs for enforcement agencies and judiciary	13	19	42	293.	Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME)	30	56	113	138</pre>(f): 	In order to continuously improve & strengthen the IPR Regime in the country, Government of India has taken multiple initiatives in the last few years.  India has acceded to WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty and Nice, Vienna and Locarno Agreements. To clear the backlog created due to paper filing of the application and slow, tedious examination procedure in the past, government has taken several initiatives to modernize the IP offices as well as augmenting the manpower at the office of Controller General of patent designs and trademarks.As a result of the steps taken by India to improve its IP regime:•	Period of examination of new Trademarks applications is reduced from 13 months in 2015-16 to less than 30 days presently. India now has among the fastest trademark examination globally.•	Trademark is registered in less than 7 months, if there are no office objections or opposition filed, as compared to 3-5 years required earlier.•	11.25 lakh Trademark  Registrations in just four and half years       (2015 to 2019) as compared to 11 lakh Registrations during 75 Years        (1940-2015).•	Patent Examination increased from 22631 in 2014-15 to 80088 by end of F.Y. 2019-20.•	Time taken in examination of patents from an average of 72 months in 2014-15 to 12 to 26 months at present.•	Grant of patents has increased from 5978 in 2014-15 to 24936 in  2019-20.However, owing to several TRIPS plus provisions and the methodology followed by IIPI, Government of India does not consider these rankings as a true indicator of its performance and does not take any specific steps to improve its ranking therein.*********
