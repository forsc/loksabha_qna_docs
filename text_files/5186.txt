ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20, as on 12.06.2019, 57.75 lakh candidates have been enrolled, out of which 52.12 lakh candidates have been trained. Dropouts have been observed at various stages in the sequential training life cycle of candidates (enrolment – training – assessment - certification – placements). These drop outs are predominantly due to various factors such as lack of interest from candidates, expectation / aspiration mismatch, lack of proper mobilization, non-appearance or failure during assessments, lack of awareness, etc. Ministry have taken various initiatives at different levels to reduce drop outs and facilitate better streamlining of system and processes such as emphasis on continuous counselling of candidates, proper mobilization through various channels including Kauhsal Melas/ Skill Saathi, connecting youth with market aligned opportunities, etc.PMKVY 2016-20 is endowed with various provisions to make the scheme more effective and ensure better training and assure employability. For ensuring quality of training under the scheme, all accreditation and affiliation of training providers (TPs) / training centres (TCs) are done through an online portal, SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres) with inspections done by independent third party assessment agencies. Adding to the improved accreditation process, MSDE has initiated a process of continuous monitoring through various channels and mandatory re-accreditation every year. Under this, self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skills Development Management System (SDMS) have been adopted. Various IT interventions such as Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar linkage of trainers and trainees, Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance of candidate and trainers, maintaining of all MIS through SDMS portal to check duplication of candidates, etc., have been ensured. Additionally, Guidelines for Training of Trainers (ToT) was launched for ensuring quality of trainers. All trainers under PMKVY 2016-20 have to be mandatorily ToT certified.Ministry has undertaken various measures to encourage greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem to improve employment outcomes. Employer led skill development is also being promoted to further improve placements rates under PMKVY 2016-20.Under PMKVY 2016-20, there are provisions for increasing the placement of the trained candidates. TCs / TPs are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. Scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. Further, the reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate.
