SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): No, Sir. 359 regional routes have been operationalized by the Selected Airline Operators(SAOs) involving 59 UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) airports including 5 heliports and 2 water aerodromes. 780 valid routes have been awarded across length and breadth of the country under the Scheme so far.  26 routes connecting Hyderabad and 4 seaplane routes connecting Nagarjuna Sagar in Telangana have been awarded to SAOs. Out of these routes,  24 routes connecting airports in Telangana have been operationalized. (c): Some of the airports under UDAN which, so far, have not been operationalised due to various reasons including the requirement of additional land for development / upgradation are attached  as Annexure.(d): UDAN is a demand driven Scheme. UDAN scheme is reviewed in consultation with stakeholders periodically and also before each bidding round. Routes which have not been operationalized due to the non compliance of SAOs are cancelled and efforts are made to operationalize by offering these routes in special rounds of bidding under UDAN.
