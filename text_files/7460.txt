                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT      (SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (d): The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme i.e. “Child Protection Services” (CPS) (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations, with the primary objective of care and protection of children in distress conditions through institutional and non-institutional care. The primary responsibility of implementation of the Scheme lies with the State/UTs. As per Section 2 (14) (iv) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is mentally ill or mentally or physically challenged or suffering from terminal or incurable disease, having no one to support or look after or having parents or guardians unfit to take care, if found so by the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee is also included as a “child in need of care and protection” (CNCP), among others and Section 2(14) (vi) of the JJ Act, defines CNCP as ones who does not have parents and no one is willing to take care of, or whose parents have abandoned or surrendered him. The scheme provides for purchase of specialised equipments and materials like Psychological test materials, training materials for speech and language, teaching materials wheel chairs, crutches, etc. Under the CPS scheme, the Ministry provides financial support for a special unit of 10 children for children with Special Needs @ Rs.10.48 lakhs (per annum). As per the information provided by the State/UT Governments including Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, the number of Child Care Institutions (CCIs)  including children with special needs registered under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 in the country is at Annexure-IHome for Widows:- A Home for Widows, namely ‘Krishna Kutir’ fully funded by the Government of India, Ministry of Women and Child Development with a capacity of 1000 inmates has been constructed at Vrindavan, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh to provide widows a safe and secure place of stay, health services, nutritious food, legal and counselling services. SwadharGreh Scheme:- The Ministry has introduced the SwadharGreh Scheme w.e.f 01.01.2016 by merging two earlier schemes viz. ‘Swadhar’ and ‘Short Stay Homes’ which cover  the entire country. Though not exclusively for widows, the SwadharGreh Scheme targets women living in difficult circumstances without social and economic support like deserted women and women survivors of natural disasters who have been rendered homeless, trafficked women/girls, women victims of terrorist violence, mentally challenged women who are without support and women with HIV/AIDS deserted by family. These women are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing, health services as well as economic and social security for them along with facilitating their emotional and economic rehabilitation into the society. The details of funds sanctioned and utilized during the last three years and the current year, State/UT-wise including Gujarat and Chhattisgarh which are being supported under the CPS is at Annexure-II.The details of funds sanctioned and utilized by the Government under SwadharGreh Scheme during each of the last three years and the current year so far, States/UT-wise including Gujarat and Chhattisgarh are at Annexure –III.(e) & (f):   Some disturbing incidents of abuse of children in the shelter homes for children have come into the notice of Ministry. The Ministry issued an advisory to the States and UTs regarding the action to be taken in case of disruption to the life of children in case of any untoward incidence of abuse in any CCI. The Minister, WCD has recently drawn attention of the Chief Ministers of all the States/UTs towards the necessity of constant monitoring and evaluation of services and facilities in CCIs in their respective States and to advise District Magistrates/District Collectors and the Superintendent of Police in each district to regularly review the action being taken to prevent child abuse.The details of complaints received in National Commission for Protection of Child Rights regarding torture including abuse and sexual exploitation of children in the CCIs/ Shelter Homes during the last three years State/UT wise is at Annexure-IV.***Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (d) of LokSabhaUnstarred Question No.1014 for answer on 22.11.2019 regarding ‘Shelter Homes.The State/UT-wise number of CCIs including children with special need under CPS Scheme as on 15.11.2019.
