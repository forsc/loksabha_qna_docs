ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b) Indian Railways receive a large number of requests inter-alia for introduction of new trains, provision of stoppages,  extension of rail routes etc. at various levels of Railway administration, a centralized compendium of which is not maintained.  Further, administratively, Indian Railways do not operate trains on state-wise basis and accordingly, the railway projects are also sanctioned Zonal Railway wise and not State- wise. However, these requests, to the extent possible, are examined and action as found feasible and justified is taken from time to time. During the year 2018-19 and 2019-20, 87 projects in the country (20 New Line, 1 Gauge conversion, 66 Doubling Works) of a total length of 8,132 km costing ` 95,548 Crore were included in the Budget subject to requisite approvals. As on 01.04.2020, 04 Railway projects falling fully/partly in the State of Uttarakhand (03 New Line and 01 Doubling works) of 243 km length, costing approx. ` 18,904 Crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which 23 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ` 2519 Crore has been incurred upto March, 2020.  Average  Annual Budget allocation for infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Uttarkhand during 2014-19, has increased to ` 672 crore per year from ` 187 crore per  year (during 2009-14), i.e  259%  more.  For financial year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of ` 4432 crore has been proposed for these works, which is 2270% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. No project was included in the budget falling fully/partly in the State of Uttarakhand during the last two years. Besides, during the said period in all 304 trains (in single), including 12091/12092 Kathgodam – Dehradhun Jan Shatabdi Express (5 days a week), serving the stations located in the State of Uttarakhand have been introduced in the country by Indian Railways. (c) and (d): Introduction of trains and provision of stoppages is an ongoing process on Indian Railways subject to availability of resources, operational feasibility and commercial justification. Besides, extension of rail routes are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes,  augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon liability of ongoing projects and overall availability of funds.*****
