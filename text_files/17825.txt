Till 09.09.2020, a total of 40.63 crore accounts have been opened under PMJDY across the country with aggregate deposit of Rs.1,29,811 crore. Out of total 40.63 crore accounts, 26.66 crore (65.61%) are in rural / semi-urban centres.  Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) with one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households.

Moreover, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted general permission to domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks  (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject to at least  25 percent  of the total number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres).
