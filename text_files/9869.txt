ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of Assam (as on 31st May, 2014)have already been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme. A JNV was set up in SonitpurDistrict of Assam in 1992-93 which now falls under the jurisdiction of the newly carved outdistrict Bishwanath Charali following reorganisation of districts of Assam. Opening of newJNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned StateGovernment/UT Administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost and makingavailable required temporary building, free of rent to run the Vidyalaya till the permanentbuilding is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends onavailability of funds and approval by the competent authority.(b) No such proposal is under consideration at present.*****
