ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (e): Sir, Chapter 9 of the Manual of the Parliamentary Procedures in the Government of India provides procedures for legislation and the Legislative Department follows the procedure stated in that Manual while drafting laws. The Ministry/ Department to whom a subject matter is allocated under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 formulates the legislative proposals in consultation with experts and stake holders as well as all interested persons and authorities concerned. The Legislative Department prepares draft laws in consultation with the administrative Ministry concerned in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Manual of Parliamentary Procedures, ordinarily within thirty days from the date of receipt of the proposal and after clearance from the Department of Legal Affairs. During a meeting of Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee the then Secretary, Legislative Department pointed out that many a times proposals are sent by the administrative Ministry very  late, giving little or no room to examine them from legal and drafting angle. On every such occasion the administrative Departments are suitably advised verbally by the Legislative Department not to submit the proposal at the last moment, since such action compromises the quality of legislative drafting.
