                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): The Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, has prepared a Uniform Code of Pharmaceuticals Marketing Practices (UCPMP) for voluntary adoption by pharmaceutical companies with effect from 01.01.2015 as guidance to the industry for promotion and marketing of drugs and medical devices.  No instance of unsuccessful implementation of UCPMP by pharma Associations/companies has been brought to notice by Department of Pharmaceuticals.        Further, Clause 6.8 (Code of Conduct for doctors in their relationship with pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry) of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 prohibits doctors from taking gifts, travel facilities, hospitality and cash or monetary grants from pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry. The said regulation empowers the Medical Council of India and respective State Medical Council to award punishment to a doctor against any act in violation of code of Ethics for doctors. Such complaints are referred by MCI to the concerned State Medical Councils where the doctors/medical practitioners are registered. The MCI is an Appellate Authority.(d): The issue of adverse effects of the product requiring higher rate of revision surgeries in patients implanted with the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip implant imported by M/s DePuy Medical Private Limited (Now M/s Johnson & Johnson) was reported to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by the said firm.         The Government had constituted a committee to examine the issues relating to faulty ASR Hip Implants. The committee, after detailed examination of the issue, submitted its report to the Government, which accepted the recommendations with some modifications. Based on the accepted recommendations, the Government constituted a Central Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. R.K. Arya, Director, Sports Injury Centre, Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi inter-alia to determine the quantum of compensation.       A formula for determining compensation for the affected patients has also been formulated and placed in public domain. The affected patients can approach either the Central Expert Committee or State Level Committees constituted by the State Governments as per their convenience.      M/s Johnson & Johnson Pvt. Ltd. has been asked to comply with the recommendations of the Committee and to pay the compensation as per the formula approved by the Government in the interest of the patients. However, M/s Johnson & Johnson Pvt. Ltd. has challenged the expert committee report on payment of compensation before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi.      The High Court of Delhi has, on 30.05.2019, ordered that the petitioner pay the sum of ?25 lakhs to each verified claimant, without prejudice to the rights of the claimants. Based on Court order, the list of verified claimants along with supporting documents has been provided to M/s Johnson and Johnson for complying with the court’s order.(e): Medical Devices are already regulated under Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Medical Devices Rules, 2017 thereunder.--
