Setting up of sewage treatment plants (STPs) at cities/ towns along the identified rivers is a major component under the NRCP.   Proposals for pollution abatement works, received from the States/UTs from time to time, for consideration under the NRCP, are sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, independent appraisal, availability of plan funds, etc.  Details of STPs set up in the State of Karnataka under NRCP are as below: Sl No	River	Towns	Sanctioned Cost (Rs. in crore)	STP Capacity Created (mld)1.

Also, in compliance of the orders of Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines.
