                                                        (a):  The Government of India is implementing a scheme titled “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan” (PMGDISHA) since 2017 to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household). The Scheme is aimed at empowering the citizens in rural areas by training them to operate computer or digital access devices (like tablets, smart phones etc.), send and receive e-mails, browse Internet, access Government services, search for information, undertake digital payment, etc. and hence enable them to use the Information Technology and related applications to actively participate in the process of nation building. A special focus of the Scheme is on the marginalised sections of society like Scheduled Castes (SC) / Scheduled Tribes (ST), women, differently-abled persons, etc. Under the PMGDISHA Scheme, as on 12.03.2021, around 4.54 Crore candidates have been enrolled and around 3.69 Crore candidates have completed the training out of which more than 2.71 Crore candidates have been certified. Almost 54 percent of the certified candidates are women; almost 21 percent candidates are from the Scheduled Caste (SC) community and around 8.7 percent candidates are from the Scheduled Tribes (ST) community. A category wise status is given below:Category	Registered	Trained	CertifiedWomen	2,35,70,178	1,95,77,486	1,48,16,925Scheduled Caste	       88,27,406 	       73,66,482 	       55,63,351 Scheduled Tribes	       40,82,796 	       32,92,923 	       23,35,980 (b):  In the state of Gujarat, as on 12.03.2021, a total of 20,12,411 candidates have been enrolled and 16,94,065 candidates have been trained, out of which 12,25,654 candidates have been certified under the PMGDISHA Scheme. *******
