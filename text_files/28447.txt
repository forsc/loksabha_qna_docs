ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (c): There is no shortage of coal in the Country. Due to increased demand of power, less power generation by imported coal based power plants and some interruption in supply of coal due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 MT (sufficient for 4 days) as on 8th October, 2021.  Subsequently with increased coal supplies, the coal stock has started increasing and has now reached 16.74 MT (sufficient for 9 days) as on 25.11.2021.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has dispatched around 54 Million Tonnes (MT)  more coal during April - October’21 in comparison to the same period of last year. CIL has dispatched 291.72 MT coal during this period, against 237.75 MT during the same period of last fiscal.The coal stock at CIL pithead was 40.23 MT as on 08.10.2021 and 32.30 MT as on 25.11.2021. The coal availability is sufficient to meet the power requirement of the country. (d) & (e): Coal mining, like any other developmental activity, does have impacts on land and surrounding environment. However, such impacts in case of coal mining are generally contained within the project area itself. In order to minimize the adverse effect of coal mining on environment, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which deals with the process to grant Environmental Clearance. The projects of Coal Sector require prior environmental clearance (EC) from MoEF&CC. While according environmental clearance for a coal project, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC)/ State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) examine the EIA/EMP report for the project which is prepared by accredited consultants and which contains detailed provisions for protecting the environment. Further the EAC/SEAC stipulates all necessary conditions in the Environment Clearance for safe-guarding the environment and also provides mitigation measures to protect the environment. In addition, all mining projects have to obtain Consent to Establish (CTE) and Consent to Operate (CTO) from State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB). These Consents also stipulate various terms and conditions for protection of environment. The stipulated conditions of environmental clearance and Consents are necessarily complied by the mining projects to minimize the adverse impacts of mining and allied activities and maintain the appropriate environmental standards in mining regions. Measurements of various parameters of air, water and noise pollution levels are carried fortnightly/half yearly/yearly as prescribed in the Environment (Protection) Act & Rules and EC conditions. Appropriate correctives measures are taken immediately if the measurements exceed the prescribed standards. Thus, the present system of regulating the forest/environment matters through MoEF&CC and CPCB/SPCBs has adequate safeguards in place for protecting and safeguarding the native environment in and around coal mining areas.  ****
