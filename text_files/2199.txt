ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (g):  Yes. The Government is implementing the e-Courts Mission Mode Project for Information and Communication Technology enablement of district and subordinate courts across the country in association with the eCommittee of Supreme Court of India. The steps being taken by the Government to promote the use of technology in the working of the courts through computerisation of district and subordinate courts are as under:(i)	The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase-I was implemented during 2011 - 2015. At the end of Phase-I, out of the total target of computerisation of 14,249 district and subordinate courts, sites for all 14,249 courts (100%) were made ready for computerisation, out of which LAN was installed at 13,643 courts, hardware was provided in 13,436 courts and software was installed in 13,672 courts. Laptops were provided to 14,309 judicial officers and change management exercise was completed in all the High Courts. Over 14,000 Judicial Officers were trained in the use of UBUNTU-Linux Operating System and more than 4,000 court staff have been trained as System Administrators in Case Information System (CIS). (ii)	The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase-II is being implemented for a period of four years (2015-19) or until the project is completed, whichever is later. The target set out under the project is computerization of 16,845 courts, which has been completed. Against the financial outlay of Rs.1670 crores for this Phase, the Government has released a sum of Rs. 1248 crore as on date to various organizations involved in the implementation of the project.  This includes a sum of Rs. 955.86 crore released to all High Courts, out of which as sum of Rs.696.23 crore has been utilized.(iii)	As per information received from eCommittee of Supreme Court of India, 16845 courts have been computerized. The High Court wise details of such district and subordinate courts are as Annexure I.(iv)	National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) for District & Subordinate Courts is created as an online platform under the Project provides information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of 16,845 computerized district and subordinate courts of the country. Currently litigants can access case status information in respect of over 11.73 crore cases and more than 9.23 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts. The portal also provides online information to litigants such as details of case registration, cause list, case status, daily orders, and final judgments. Approximately 3000 Court Complexes replicate live data of filing, registration, scrutiny, objections, case status, cause list, judgment and orders.  Litigant centric information can be obtained through the website of the eCourts portal by accessing using the URL: https://ecourts.gov.in. Case information is thus available speedily to the petitioners and respondents.	NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases. The NJDG covers all categories of cases. It helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.	World Bank praised the National Judicial Data Grid in the Ease of Doing Business Report for 2018, that it made possible to generate case management reports, thereby making it easier to enforce contracts.  	High Court NJDG has also been made operational, wherein High Courts have also joined the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) through web services. (v)	ECourts mobile app with the facility of QR Code was launched on 22.07.2017 for use of litigants and lawyers. Services under different captions viz. Search by CNR, Case Status, Cause List and My Cases are available on this application, which is available on both Google Play and Apple Store. The number of downloads have crossed 20 lakhs.(vi)	Furthermore, the facility of providing case information services through SMS has also been implemented and the process of disseminating system-generated SMSs is operational. The case details can also be obtained by sending unique CNR number (Case Number Record) to a mobile number through SMS. Cause lists, judgements, case status etc. can be received in the litigants’ mailbox on registration of email address. Information Kiosks have been setup at all computerized court complexes for disseminating judicial information related to cause lists and other case related information to the lawyers and litigants.  (vii)	The eFiling application was launched on 14thAugust, 2018 and is made available at efiling.ecourts.gov.in where online registration of lawyers and litigants can be done. e-filing application has been developed and is integrated with Case Information Software (CIS 3.0), which is the standard application software across all district and subordinate courts of the country. Integration with CIS 1.0 software of High Courts is also complete.e-filing module with e-payment of court fees is ready for courts in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana. In other states, except for epayment, the efiling module is ready for launch in all the courts that have shifted to CIS 1.0 and CIS 3.0.(viii)	One of the important eCourts project components is establishment of Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting all  District and Subordinate court complexes, spread across the country. The eCommittee of Supreme Court of India gave approval to award the eCourts’ WAN project to BSNL. Work order to the tune of Rs. 169 crores has been awarded to BSNL for establishing Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting 2992 district and subordinate court complexes across the country, including 547 court complexes with no connectivity. National Informatics Centre has operationalised an online monitoring tool for tracking real-time progress and monitoring of pan - Indian WAN project against the set baselines. Out of 2992 court complexes, 2295 have been connected through eCourts WAN as on 28.6.2019. (ix)	During the Phase II, till date, 228.33 crore electronic transactions have been recorded for eCourts through eTaal portal. The eCourts transactions have thus emerged as one of the topmost accessed services of the Government of India.(x)	The eCourts Project equips the Judiciary to use ICT enabled tools to improve court and case management. The availability of online database enables judiciary to plan court administration. It leads to making the justice delivery system across the country more transparent, more accessible and affordable. Availability of case data online imparts transparency to the functioning of courts and facilitates easy access of such data to lawyers and litigants. Thus, ICT enablement of courts increases efficiency of justice delivery system through organised and easy access to case information, and transparency is the eventual outcome.   (xi)	Other steps taken by the Government towards full computerization of courts includes efforts of scanning and digitisation of court records. Central Government has accepted the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission which included scanning and digitisation of court records of all High Courts, district and subordinate courts. The 14th Finance Commission has urged the state governments to use the additional fiscal space provided by the 14th Finance Commission in the tax devolution from 32% to 42% to meet such requirements. -----ANNEXURE-ISl.
