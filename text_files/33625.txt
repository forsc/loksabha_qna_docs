                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a):	The details of allocation and utilization of funds under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna (PMKSY) is as under: 2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22 (as on 31.01.2022)Alloc ation	Expen diture	Alloc ation	Expen diture	Alloc ation	Expen diture	Alloc  ation	Expen diture	Alloc ation	Expen diture	Alloc ation	Expen diture729.00	716.98	715.18	685.83	1000	719.17	1042.79	845.54	847.42	755.61	798.66	579.78 (b) & (c): Ministry has been organizing/sponsoring seminars, workshops, exhibitions, etc. for spreading awareness amongst stakeholders about the benefits available under various schemes of the Ministry with the aim to encourage investment in the sector.  In 2021, food processing summits were organized in Assam (Guwahati), Madhya Pradesh (Gwalior) and Meghalaya (Shillong).  Hosting of such events has however been severely impacted due to the guidelines for strict adherence of COVID appropriate behaviour and the restrictions imposed by different States/UTs to curb spread of corona virus. Ministry has, however, been extensively utilizing social media and digital platforms for outreaching to the stakeholders.  (d):	The details of projects approved under PMKSY for Entities (other than Institutions/Universities) owned by the States including those sanctioned during the last year are given in Annexure.  No fresh EoI was issued for inviting applications after 31st March 2021.    *****
