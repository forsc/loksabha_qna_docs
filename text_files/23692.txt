                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	 India started external supplies of Made-in-India COVID19 vaccines on 20 January 2021. The first countries to receive such vaccines were from our neighbourhood. External supplies are being undertaken in the form of grant, commercial sales by the manufacturers and through GAVI’s COVAX facility. India, as most other countries, is implementing its COVID-19 vaccination programme in a phased manner. Taking into account domestic production, requirements of the phased roll out of national vaccination programme and the demand for Made-in-India vaccines, a decision was taken to supply the surplus to foreign countries on bilateral-grant or commercial basis. The supply to GAVI’s COVAX facility is an obligation since India is a member of this multilateral body and also a recipient of vaccines from this body.Country-wise details for supply of vaccines till 18 March 2021 are enclosed. <pre>Supplies till 21 March 2021 (In lakhs)Sl.
