The major programme under this Scheme is the National Green Corps (NGC) “Eco-club” programme under which Eco-clubs have been set up in schools and colleges to educate students and to spread awareness on environmental issues through various activities like plantation drives, cleanliness drives, celebration of important environmental days, awareness and capacity building on solid waste management through waste segregation, action plan for declaring schools as single-use plastic free, celebration of Harit Diwali, etc. Further, under this programme, a social movement named the Green Good Deeds (GGDs) movement was also launched in 2018 with the aim to bring about mass environmental awareness in the society at all levels. The green deeds are simple, practical steps that every individual may perform in day-to-day life in order to adopt an environment-friendly lifestyle. A compilation of such deeds has also been published  under the title ‘Green Deeds & Habits for Sustainable Environment’.*****
