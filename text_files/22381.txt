                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c)	 A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. 307 FOR 17th MARCH, 2021 REGARDING “TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS IN VILLAGES”(a) 	Sir, the total number of villages (inhabited villages as per census 2011) in the country where telecommunication towers have been set up during each of the last three years and the current year, State/UT-wise and telecom company-wise, is attached as Annexure-1.	The total number of villages in Deoria District of Uttar Pradesh where telecommunication towers have been set up during each of the last three years and current year, telecom company-wise, is attached as Annexure-2.(b) 	Out of 5,97,618 villages of the Country, 5,72,551 number of villages are already having mobile connectivity which is 95.8%. The Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), as per the requirement of DoT have provided these numbers. These numbers are furnished by various TSPs who provide mobile connectivity in the villages and they have authentic data about the villages wherein they provide service. Over the years, the Government and Department of Telecommunication have been insisting on the TSPs to upgrade the Telecom Infrastructure particularly the BTS and Towers. The consistent effort has shown significant result as is evident from the table given below<pre>Number of BTS	6,49,834(March-14)	22,30,192(March-21)Number of Tower	4,15,724(Dec-15)	6,40,613(March-21)</pre>However, while taking note of the efforts of TSPs there have been some factors which have created some road blocks in this context. These are inability to install additional BTSs on existing Towers due to loading issues, opposition from local residents due to the perceived fear of EMF (Electro-Magnetic Field) radiation, non-availability of suitable structure at various places, inaccessible terrain and transportation difficulties of equipment at various locations, and unwarranted delays in commissioning new sites due to various procedural formalities from local administration/ agencies  account for the 4.2% uncovered villages.(c) 	Government took a series of actions to improve the telecommunication network to cover all the villages of the country with network connectivity.  Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) was created to provide widespread and non-discriminatory access to quality information and communication technology (ICT) services at affordable prices for people living in rural and remote areas. Government under USOF prepares various schemes to provide mobile connectivity in uncovered remote and rural villages. The details of these schemes are provided at Annexure-3.		Further, in order to address the difficulties being faced by the Telecom Service Providers, Infrastructure Providers and Telecom Companies with various States/ Union Territories and Concerned Central Government Departments/ Agencies in setting up underground and over ground telecom infrastructure on account of multiple right of way related issues and exorbitant charges, the Government of India notified Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules – 2016 in November 2016. These rules govern the Right of Way procedures for setting up towers and laying fibers across the country.
