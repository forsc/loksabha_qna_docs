ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (d)  Rivers in the country are polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution and other non-point sources of pollution. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have compounded the problem. As per the last report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure-I.             As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.            According to CPCB, there are 2839 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) in the country which are discharging their effluents in various water bodies. Out of total 2839 industries, 2186 industries are operational and 653 industries are self-closed. The number of complying and non-complying units are 2055 and 131 respectively. Action taken against the non-complying units includes issue of show-cause notices to 55 units, issue of closure directions to 56 units and filing of legal cases against 2 units. State/Union Territory (UT) wise compliance status of GPI units in the country is attached as Annexure-II.             Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of industrial effluents into rivers, inter-alia, include issuance of notification of specific discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing directions to all  SPCBs/PCCs to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/consent to operate by the SPCBs/PCCs, regular and surprise inspections of GPIs for compliance verification against stipulated environmental norms, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status. In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their waste water generation by technological advancement, reuse/recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible.             Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans, including those for industrial pollution control, for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.*****ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d)
