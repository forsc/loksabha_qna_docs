Such permissions are accorded with the recommendation of the concerned State/UT and for inescapable projects/purposes. While according permission under the provisions of the Act, the Central Government allows removal of minimum number trees and the tress are removed only when it is necessary. Moreover, conditions regarding translocation of trees and phase wise removal of trees under the strict supervision of State/UT Forest Department are invariably stipulated to minimize the number of trees to be removed. As per the Government policy, more trees are planted than number of trees approved for removal under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Because of this policy, India’s forest cover is increasing.Government’s efforts to plant more trees than removed is reflected in the assessments in biennial India State of Forest Reports (ISFR) by Forest Survey of India. As per the biennial edition of ISFR of 2019, the forest and tree cover has increased by 13,209 square km as compared to that of ISFR 2015 assessment.***
