                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to part (a) to (d) Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 171 for answer on 29.11.2019 by SHRI DEEPAK BAIJ regarding Malnutrition(a)	to (d) As per National Family Health Surveys (NFHS-4) conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight, 38.4% are stunted and 58.5% children are anaemic indicating a reduction from the previous NFHS – 3 conducted in 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight, 48% stunted and 69.5% as anaemic. As per the report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) (2016-18), prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children is 34.7%, 17% and 33.4% respectively, which is a reduction from the levels reported by NFHS-4.Malnutrition is a complex and multi-dimensional issue, affected by a number of generic factors including poverty, inadequate food consumption due to access and availability, inequitable food distribution, improper maternal infant and child feeding and care practices, inequity and gender imbalances, poor sanitary and environmental conditions; and restricted access to quality health, education and social care services.The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is making serious efforts to eradicate malnutrition. Several schemes with direct as well as indirect interventions are being implemented across the country. Schemes like Anganwadi Services, Scheme for Adolescent Girls and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna (PMMVY) under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme as direct targeted interventions are being implemented to address the problem of malnutrition among women and children in the country. Anganwadi Services, aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group 0-6 years, pregnant women & lactating mothers and reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity and malnutrition. Under the Scheme, a package of six services is provided through a network of Anganwadi Centers, which include supplementary nutrition, pre-school non-formal education, nutrition & health education, immunization, health check-up and referral services. National Food Security Act, promulgated in 2013, has mandated the nutritional entitlement for the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services as legal entitlement. The scheme is universal and open to all the eligible beneficiaries. A total number of 1.60 crore women and 6.75 crore children are benefitted under the Anganwadi Services as on 30.06.2019 (Annexure-I)Scheme for Adolescent Girls is implemented for out-of-school adolescent girls in the age group of 11-14 years for self-development and empowerment of adolescent girls; improvement of nutritional and health status; to promote awareness about health, hygiene & nutrition; support to out of school Adolescent Girls for successful transition back to formal schooling or bridge learning/skill training; upgrade their home-based skills and life skills. A total number of 4.76 lakh Adolescent Girlsare benefitted under the SAG scheme as on 14.11.2019 (Annexure-II)The objective of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is to provide cash incentive to improve health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM) and to compensate partially the wage loss in terms of cash incentive so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first child. A total number of 1.11 crore beneficiaries have benefitted under PMMVY and Rs. 4,501.50 Crore have been dispersed to the beneficiaries as on 27.11.2019 (Annexure-III)Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan on 18.12.2017 for a three year time frame commencing from 2017-18 with an overall budget of Rs. 9046 Crore. To ensure a holistic approach, all 37 States/UTs and districts have been covered.
