ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE ( INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) and (b) The Ministry releases funds to State Governments under the MPLAD Scheme for execution of works recommended by the Hon’ble MPs and implemented by the respective authorities as per State Government administrative, technical and financial rules. During the Financial year 2017-18 works of Rs. 4057.65 Crores were sanctioned while in 2018-19 this figure was at Rs. 4965.73 Crores.  Several measures are taken by the Ministry from time to time to expedite use of MPLAD funds, some of which are as follows:- (i)   Regularly follow up with the District Authorities to submit the fund related documents online for timely release of fund. Training to the District Officials is also being imparted. (ii)  Officers are deputed to visit various States/ Districts to review the implementation of the Scheme. (iii) Annual Review Meeting are held with the Nodal Departments of all the State / UT Governments to discuss the implementation of the scheme.  Ministry also impresses upon the Nodal Departments of the State / UT Governments to convene Meetings under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary with the District Authorities and Members of Parliament at least once in a year.  In addition Quarterly review meetings are held by the District Authorities with the implementing agencies at district level to review the progress of implementation of MPLAD Scheme. (c) Non-submission of Monthly Progress Reports (MPRs) and Utilization Certificate (UC) in time is one of the primary reason for delay in releasing of MPLADS installments.                                             *****
