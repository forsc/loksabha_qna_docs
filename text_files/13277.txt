ANSWER




                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): 	Yes, Sir. In the latest Doing Business Report (DBR), 2020 released by the World Bank on 24th October, 2019, India stands at 63rd position out of 190 countries, registering a jump of 14 places from its last year’s rank. Since 2014, India’s rank has gone up from 142 to 63 in 2019. This improvement in regulatory environment in the country reflects a positive sentiment among businessmen/professionals and is also instrumental in promoting India as a favourable investment destination across the globe. As a reflection of improving business environment, FDI into India increased by 72% i.e. from US $36 Bn in 2013-14 to US $62 Bn in 2018-19. (c): 	India has been recognized in top ten countries with most reforms undertaken for 3 consecutive years under DBR, 2020.(d): 	A number of steps have been taken to sensitize the professionals about the reforms undertaken. An intensive outreach program has been carried out to generate awareness among general public. It includes release of advertisements in print media in the country as well as abroad. Short films on various reforms have also been produced and shared across various social media platforms.*******
