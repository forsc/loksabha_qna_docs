                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (c): The Government has enacted ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’ (SH Act) with the aim to provide safe and secure work environment to women irrespective of their work status.           The Act casts an obligation upon every employer of a workplace to provide a safe and secure working environment free from sexual harassment by constituting Internal Committee (IC) for receiving complaints of sexual harassment at workplace and by displaying at conspicuous places penal consequences of sexual harassment and order constituting IC. Similarly, the State Governments are authorised to constitute Local Committees (LCs) in every district to receive complaints from organizations having less than 10 workers or if the complaint is against employer himself.             The Act entrust the Appropriate Government (that is in relation to a workplace which is established, owned, controlled or wholly or substantially financed by funds provided directly or indirectly by Central Government or Union Territory Administration, the Central Government or by the State Government, the State Government) with the responsibility of monitoring implementation of the Act.            The responsibility to maintain data on the number of cases filed and disposed of in respect of all cases of sexual harassment at workplace, which are established, owned, controlled or wholly or substantially financed by funds provided directly or indirectly by the State at District and State levels rests with the concerned State Governments.                To ensure effective implementation of the Act, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a handbook and a training module around the provisions of the Act. In addition, Ministry of Women and Child Development has issued advisories, from time to time, to all State Governments/ UT Administrations, Ministries/ Departments of the Central Government and business associations/ chambers to ensure effective implementation of the Act.  In addition, Ministry has conducted a number of video conferences requesting State Governments to establish and build capacity of LCs in each district of the country.  *******
