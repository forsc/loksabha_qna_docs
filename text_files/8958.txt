ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)a) to (d):	Mission Antyodaya is not a scheme, rather a framework of convergence with Gram Panchayat (GP) as focal points. When launched in 2017, Mission Antyodaya was piloted in 50,000 GPs and later expanded to all other GPs in the country, including those in Uttar Pradesh. The framework seeks convergence of various Government schemes/ programmes with a saturation approach for better planning, optimal outcomes and more efficient use of available resources in order to address multi-dimensional poverty. Further, the development gaps, based on selected parameters at GP-level, are identified through Mission Antyodaya Survey so that the same can be bridged while preparing and implementing Gram Panchayat Development Plan. Using the Survey data, GPs in the country are also ranked and the details are available at; https://missionantyodaya.nic.in/ma2018/preloginRankingOfGp2018.html.*****
