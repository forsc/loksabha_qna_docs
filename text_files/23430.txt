Under the DBT system, sale of all subsidized fertilizers to farmers/buyers is made through Point of Sale (PoS) devices installed at each retailer shop and the beneficiaries are identified through Aadhaar Card, KCC, Voter Identity Card etc. and subsidy payment on various fertilizer grades is being released to the fertilizer companies on weekly basis, on the basis of actual sales made by the retailers to the beneficiaries through Point of Sale (PoS) devices installed at each retailer shop.(b)	: Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) of fertilizer subsidy to farmers has been under discussion at various forums. A Committee of Secretaries headed by Cabinet Secretary has been setup to develop the broad contours of the DCT framework under which DCT to farmers can be implemented.
