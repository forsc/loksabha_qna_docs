ANSWER




                                                                             MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE                               (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)                                             *****(a)	The number of Permanent Account Numbers (PANs) which are linked with Aadhaar  Number as on 27.01.2020 is  30,75,02,824.(b)	Yes Sir. (c)	The due date for linking of PAN with Aadhaar Number as specified under sub-section (2) of section 139AA of the Income-tax Act,1961(‘Act’) has been further extended from 31st December,2019 to 31st March, 2020 vide Notification bearing S.O number 4708(E) dated 30.12.2019. As on 27.01.2020, a total of 17,58,03,617 PANs are not linked with Aadhaar. The extension of due date for linking of PAN with Aadhaar will benefit these PAN card holders as they will get extra time to link their PANs with Aadhaar.  	Further, in order to ensure that sensitive data is not leaked by handling organisations, the guidelines laid down by Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in this regard are being followed. Appropriate measures have also been taken in terms of provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, Information Technology Act, 2000 and other applicable laws to ensure that the confidentiality of data is maintained.(d) & (e) As per sub-section (5) of section 139A of the Act read with Rule 114B of Income-Tax Rules, 1962,  a person is required to quote PAN in respect of any sale or purchase of immovable property for an amount exceeding ten lakh rupees or valued by stamp valuation authority referred to in section 50C of the Act at an amount exceeding ten lakh rupees. The due date for linking of PAN with Aadhaar as specified under sub-section (2) of section 139AA of the Act is 31.03.2020. This measure will help to curb benami property and bring in transparency.                                                 *****
