The NCS project aims to provide seamless access to Jobseekers and employers, decent employment opportunities to the aspiring youth of the country and to facilitate career development assistance. The NCS Portal brings together Jobseekers and employers on one platform to facilitate job opportunities and career related services to the Jobseekers of the country.  Since the confirmation of final hiring figure is not mandatory on NCS Portal, the job hiring data is available only to the extent as voluntarily reported by the employers. (e): 		  Ministry has partnered with various private Job portals for integration with NCS in order to provide increased access to the youth for the vast variety of employment opportunities across the country including the youth belonging to Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. The number of active Job seekers registered on NCS Portal as on 31st January 2022 from the state of Maharashtra is 13.92 lakhs and from the State of Tamil Nadu is 5.72 lakhs.The NCS Project inter-alia includes establishment of Model Career Centres (MCCs) in collaboration with States and other institutions to maximise the reach of employment related services. The MCC also aims to organise the job fairs, mobilise the employers, provide the career counselling at District level etc. In the State of Maharashtra,5 Model Career Centres and in the State of Tamil Nadu,10 Model Career Centres have been established. The other steps that have been taken by the Government under the NCS Project to increase the access to the youth for the vast variety of employment opportunities across the country are as under:I.	NCS portal launched an online Job Fair module where the complete cycle of job posting to selection of candidate can be completed on the portal.II.	A Special link for Work From Home Jobs has been created on NCS portal to give direct access to Jobseekers to these jobs.III.

DigiSaksham programme has been initiated on NCS Portal to enhance the employability of youth by imparting them the digital skills.VI.	NCS Portal is providing links to public disclosure of scores and ranking of candidates who have not qualified in the final merit list in government recruitment examinations so that these candidates may have other job options on the NCS Portal. The employers can access this publically available information through NCS Portal.VII.	A separate window on Human Resources for Health Sector on NCS Portal has been developed so that employers can find relevant jobseekers/professionals in the healthcare sector based on their key skills and education qualifications.*****
