ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (e): As per the information uploaded by the State of Bihar on PRoject Appraisal, Budgeting Achievements and Data Handling System (PRABANDH) Portal, the details of approvals and progress for carrying out various interventions under Samagra Shiksha Scheme from 2018-19 to 2021-22 are at Annexure.Under Centrally Sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha financial assistance is provided as per the fund sharing pattern as decided by the Ministry of Finance. Underthe scheme, the annual plans are prepared by the States and UTs based on their requirements and priority and this is reflected in their respective Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B) Proposals. These plans are then appraised and approved/estimated by the Project Approval Board (PAB) in the Department of School Education & Literacy in consultation with the States and UTs as per the programmatic and financial norms of the scheme, and physical and financial progress of the State for the interventions approved earlier. Further, the funds are released on the basis of submission of Audited Accounts, Utilization Certificate, physical and financial progress and other documents as prescribed under the Financial Management & Procurement (FMP) Manual of Samagra Shiksha.Education is in the Concurrent list of the Constitution. As per Section 23 (3) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 “the salary and allowances payable to, and the terms and conditions of services of teachers shall be such as may be prescribed.” Thus, terms and conditions of recruitment, salary and service of all teachers are governed and regulated by the concerned State and UT Government as stipulated in their Rules/ Regulations/ Notifications. As per framework of Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, there is no separate cadre of teachers sanctioned by the Centre. All teachers are ultimately the responsibility of the State Government. However, through Samagra Shiksha, Central Government provides financial assistance to States and UTs for teacher salary as per the prescribed norms of the scheme.*****
