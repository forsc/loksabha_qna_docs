ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a):   Coal companies dispatch coal as per Freight on Board (FoB) basis and consumers have the liberty to lift coal in various modes such as rail, road and captive modes (Merry Go Round (MGR), Belt, Rope etc.) The choice of mode of transportation is decided by the coal consumers.  In 2020-21, National Waterways (NWs) in India carried about 25.92 Million Tonnes (MT) of coal and coke out of total cargo movement of 83.61 MT through waterways.(b): Taking ahead the vision of the Government of India to promote inland waterways as a supplementary mode of transport, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) have considered waiver of waterway user charges initially for a period of three years from July 2020. Government is considering required policy support and also provide necessary incentives to logistics operators to shift from other modes of transport to Inland Water Transport. The efforts made for development of inland waterways for shipping inland cargo movement from road and rail to water transport are detailed:i. For improvement in cargo traffic on National Waterways, i.e. by diverting the cargo from rail/road to water transport, concept papers on potential of movement of fertilizers, coal, Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), iron & steel and textiles were prepared and shared with respective Ministries. The matter has been pursued with respective Ministries on regular basis and response has been received from Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Steel, and Ministry of Textiles and recently from Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited, (IFFCO) for movement of fertilizers on waterways.ii.Pilot/scheduled movements were also conducted for transportation of textiles and steel to various destinations in Bangladesh, using IBP routes. *****
