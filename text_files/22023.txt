ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): National Education Policy 2020 like National Education Policy 1968 and 1986 reiterates and endorses a substantial increase in public investment in education by both the Central government and all State Governments. It further states that Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP. Since Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution of India, hence, State/UT Government will play a vital role in the implementation of the National Education Policy. Also, timely infusion of requisite resources - human, infrastructural, and financial - at the Central and State levels will be crucial for the satisfactory execution of the Policy.(b): The NEP 2020 takes into account the local and global needs of the country, and with a respect for and deference to its rich diversity and culture. Instilling knowledge of India and its varied social, cultural, and technological needs, its inimitable artistic, language, and knowledge traditions, and its strong ethics in India’s young people is considered critical for purposes of national pride, self-confidence, self-knowledge, cooperation, and integration. One of the fundamental principles of the policy is ‘respect for diversity and respect for the local context in all curriculum, pedagogy, and policy, always keeping in mind that education is a concurrent subject’.(c) to (d): The National Education Policy 2020 has been finalised after detailed consultation process with all stakeholders including State/UT Governments, followed by the approval of Union Cabinet. A large number of consultations / deliberations at different level were held before finalising the policy. NEP 2020 is built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability. The National Education Policy 2020 envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high-quality education to all, innovation and research and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge. The Policy envisages that the curriculum and pedagogy of our institutions must develop among the students a deep sense of respect towards the Fundamental Duties and Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and a conscious awareness of one’s roles and responsibilities in a changing world. The vision of the Policy is to instill among the learners a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought, but also in spirit, intellect, and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen. The NEP 2020 has been finalised in alignment with constitutional provisions. *******
