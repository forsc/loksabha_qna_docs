The same cabin crew in a recent complaint made to AI had reported misbehaviour by the same pilot on a past occasion.; (c) Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) investigated the matter and issued show cause notice to pilot in Command and concerned cabin crew also. AI has kept the Pilot off flying for one month till 19.07.2019.
