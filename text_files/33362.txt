ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes Sir, Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) with an objective to impart short duration skill development training and certification to unemployed youth and to make them employable for better livelihood across the country.(b)       Under PMKVY, since inception, i.e., 2015 till 31.12.2021, around 1.34 crore candidates (0.69 crore trained in Short Term training (STT) and 0.65 crore oriented in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)) trained / oriented across the country. The State-wise details are given at Annexure I.(c)        The district-wise number of operational training centres (PMKVY-STT) including Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in the State of Maharashtra is given at Annexure II. (d)       PMKVY has two components, namely, Central component being implemented through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and State component being implemented through State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the State/UT. Under Central component of PMKVY, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs). The State-wise funds disbursed under State component and spent under Central component in last three years, i.e., FY 2018-21, under PMKVY is given at Annexure III. (e)       To ensure effective implementation of PMKVY, the life cycle of training process of candidates (enrolment – training – assessment – certification - placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill India Portal (SIP) which is linked with Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance. Training Centres (TCs) are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, etc. Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of TCs. (f)        Yes, Sir. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the disruptions in economy, livelihood and labour market. The skill ecosystem was also impacted due to COVID-19 induced lockdown. In order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and to restore the skilling activities, MSDE has taken various initiatives under the skill ecosystem such as Introduction of On-line skill training through eSkill India portal and Bharat Skill portal, Customized Crash Course Programme for COVID Warriors, Special programme for training of reverse migrants under PMKVY in 6 States, COVID Allowance to training centres, Operation and Maintenance of Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) Oxygen Plants, etc.  Annexure IState-wise number of candidates trained, certified, and placed under PMKVY-STT and candidates oriented and certified under PMKVY-RPL, since inception i.e. 2015 till 31.12.2021:S.
