ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a ) &  (b) Air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, however, there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of  death/ disease exclusively due to air  pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.	Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare along with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has conducted the study ‘India State-level Disease Burden Initiative’. The report, titled ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States - The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative’  was published in 2017. The study report provided the distribution of diseases and risk factors across all states of the country from 1990 to 2016. The five leading risk factors for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2016 includes child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. (c ) The Hon’ble National Green Tribunal vide order dated 8th April 2021 directed for constitution of an eight-member National Task Force (NTF) to be headed and coordinated by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change with nominees of Ministries from Housing and Urban  Development, Road Transport, Petroleum, Power, Agriculture, Health and Chairman, CPCB with a view to monitor remedial steps to improve the status of air quality in Non –attainment Cities . 	In compliance, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has reconstituted a Steering Committee vide Office Order dated 20.05.2021 under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Environment Forest and Climate Change  in agreement with the objectives of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) . The Committee inter alia provided overall guidance  and directions for effective implementation of NCAP, discharge functions assigned to NTF, evolve and oversee parameters for ranking of success of remedial action for 124 Non-Attainment Cities (NACs)  covered by NCAP, 42 million plus cities covered by 15th Finance Commission Grants and other air polluted areas, etc.  (d)  	A list of cities (State-wise) where air quality does not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards is at Annexure – I. (e) & (f)  The Government of India has been implementing  NCAP  since 2019 as a national-level strategy,  outlining the actions for reducing the levels of air pollution at city and regional scales in India. The NCAP targets to achieve 20 to 30 per cent reduction in Particulate Matter by 2024 across the country. The long term goal of NCAP is to meet the prescribed annual average ambient air quality standards at all locations in the country in a stipulated timeframe. The cities which have shown improvement in air quality under NCAP programme are at Annexure II.***
