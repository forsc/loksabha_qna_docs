ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. At present, 15 operational airports of Airports Authority of India (AAI) namely Akola, Behala, Bilaspur, Faizabad, Gondia, Hyderabad (Begumpet), Juhu (Mumbai), Kanpur (Civil), Keshod, Kota, Meerut, Moradabad, Safdarjung, Sholapur and Tezu do not have any scheduled flight operations.;(c) & (d): AAI has collaborated with State Government of Punjab for development of a new Civil Enclave at Halwara in Ludhiana district and has signed a Joint Venture Agreement in this regard with the State Government on 12.06.2019. ;(e): Improving airport infrastructure is a continuous process which is undertaken by AAI from time to time depending on the passenger traffic, operational requirements, land availability etc. AAI has undertaken works of construction of new Terminal Building at Adampur Airport and additional parking bays at Amritsar Airport. ;;As far as matter of improving air connectivity is concerned, flights operations in domestic sector have been deregulated and the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) issued by the Government. It is upto the airline operators to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. However, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity to currently underserved and unserved airports by making it affordable. Flight operations have commenced under the RCS from Adampur, Bhatinda, Ludhiana and Pathankot airports in Punjab.
