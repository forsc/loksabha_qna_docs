Synagogues are the places of worship of Jewish community. Therefore, issues relating to Jews community do not come under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Minority Affairs.  As per the information received from Archaeological Survey of India under the Ministry of Culture, no synagogues/aliyah come under the jurisdiction of Archaeological Survey of India. (b) 	There is no plan to preserve synagogues/aliyah in the Ministry of Minority Affairs. *****
