                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (c): Ayushman Bharat — Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched in September 2018 for providing accessible and affordable healthcare to the common man. As the world’s largest government-funded healthcare programme, it targeted more than 50 crore beneficiaries at the time of its launch. NITI Aayog’s “Strategy for New India @ 75”, published in November 2018, envisioned as part of the goal of universal health coverage, coverage of at least 75% of the population with publicly financed health insurance by March 2023. Against the above target of 50 crore persons, according to information provided by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, 14.09 crore families with an estimated 70 crore persons have been covered under AB-PMJAY. Further, another 14 crore persons have been covered under Employees’ State Insurance Scheme and Central Government Health Scheme.************
