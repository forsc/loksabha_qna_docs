ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	The details of seafood products exported from India during last 3 years are as follows:-Value (in million USD)	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20USA	2320.05	2344.43	2562.54JAPAN	445.27	423.27	422.24EUROPEAN UNION	1116.74	900.50	876.47CHINA	227.39	811.14	1374.63SOUTH EAST ASIA	2237.07	1531.53	705.99MIDDLE EAST	290.46	286.30	297.23OTHERS	444.57	431.33	439.60TOTAL	7081.55	6728.50	6678.69(b)	Yes Sir. (c)	There are two major conditions imposed by USA, on the import of seafood products from all exporting countries including India:-(i) 	The Section 609 of US Public Law 101-162 prohibits the importation of shrimp and products from shrimp harvested in ways that may adversely affect sea turtles unless the US Department of State certifies to the US Congress that the government of the harvesting nation has taken measures for reducing the incidental taking of sea turtles in its shrimp trawl fisheries, comparable to that of the USA, or that the fishing environment of the harvesting nation does not pose a threat to the sea turtles.    (ii) 	The National Marine Fisheries Services of NOAA, USA had introduced the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Import) Rule, which mandates that nations exporting fish and fishery products to the United States, have a regulatory program for reducing marine mammal bycatch that is comparable in effectiveness to measures taken by the United States. Accordingly, in order to evaluate an exporting nation’s regulatory programs to address incidental/intentional mortality or serious injury of marine mammals and ensure continuation of seafood exports to USA, all the seafood exporting countries including India are required to furnish the complete information about their commercial fishing operations identified under MMPA Import Rule by November, 2021.(d) & (e)   Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) had been providing financial assistance to the seafood processors/exporters for the development of infrastructure, value addition in exports and introduction of new technologies, aimed to bring in more investment in high end value addition, establishment of facilities to export chilled and dried marine products having high unit value. MPEDA has provided financial assistance of approx. Rs.14.42 Crore during FY 2019-20.Government of India is implementing Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with an envisaged investment of Rs. 20,050 Crore for development of fisheries in the country over 5 years, which would also enhance exports. PMMSY envisages a focus on species diversification, value addition, infrastructure creation, modernization, end to end traceability from ‘catch to consumer’, brand promotion, certification etc. in close collaboration with MPEDA. Further, promotion of good aquaculture practices, use of block chain technology, global standards and certification, accreditation of brood banks, hatcheries, farms etc. are incorporated as a part of the PMMSY scheme. These steps will ensure better quality, higher productivity, improve export competitiveness and fetch higher prices for fishers and farmers.                                             ******
