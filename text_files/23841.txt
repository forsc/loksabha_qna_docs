                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  & (b)   Rivers and water bodies in the country are  polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/ towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments. As per report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in March, 2015 sewage generation from urban areas in the country is estimated at 61, 948 million litres per day (mld), against which available sewage treatment capacity was 23,277 mld.Rivers also serve as a source for drinking water supply in many towns/cities. River cleaning is a continuous process and the Central Government assists the State Governments and Urban Local Bodies through schemes like ‘Namami Gange’ and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) of Ministry of Jal Shakti. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs.5965.90 crore & sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 335 projects has been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.29,578 crore so far, of which 142 projects have been completed and made operational. Out of 335 projects, 156 projects are in the sewerage sector for creation of total sewage treatment capacity of 4867 mld and sewerage network of 5066 kms.Water is a State subject and the Union Government supplements the efforts of State Governments and Union Territories(UTs) by providing financial and technical assistance for the projects of drinking water supply. The States/ UTs and their agencies plan and approve projects of water supply as well as implement, operate& maintain these schemes. 		Union Government in partnership with States and UTs is implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)-Har Ghar Jal to enable every rural household in the country to have potable water through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, with an estimated outlay of Rs.3.60 lakh Crore.In addition, sewerage & drinking water supply infrastructure is being created in urban areas under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.*****
