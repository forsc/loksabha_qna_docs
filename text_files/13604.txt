ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                               (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) PMAY(U) guidelines require States/UTs to conduct demand assessment for providing housing to all eligible families/ beneficiaries. So far, States/UTs have assessed a demand of around 1.12 Crore houses in urban areas and these houses are proposed to be constructed by March 2022.(b)	Under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) component of PMAY(U), there is an interest subsidy of 6.5 % for Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/ Low Income Group (LIG), 4% for Middle Income Group-I (MIG-I) and 3% for Middle Income Group-II (MIG-II), calculated on housing  loan up to Rs. 6 lakh, Rs. 9 lakh and Rs. 12 lakh, respectively, over a loan tenure of 20 years. For a loan tenure of 20 years, the CLSS beneficiaries of EWS/LIG, MIG-I and MIG-II  get upfront approximate subsidy amounts of Rs.2,67,280/- , Rs.2,35,068/- and Rs.2,30,156/- respectively. (c) As per the PMAY(U) Scheme Guidelines, the eligibility is based upon the annual income of the household and all individuals who have availed housing loans are eligible to apply for the CLSS subsidy, if otherwise eligible. Primary Lending Institutions (PLIs) follow guidelines and regulations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) / National Housing Bank (NHB) etc. while sanctioning the loans. PLIs also exercise their due diligence including assessment of the loan eligibility and the repayment capacity of the borrower while sanctioning the loans. (d) & (e)The home loan applications involving CLSS subsidyare scrutinized at PLIs level as per their due diligence process and the details about number of applications received and rejected by PLIs and the reasons for their rejection are not reported to Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs)/this Ministry. In Tiruvannamalai district in Tamil Nadu under CLSS 138 houses have been sanctioned during the financial years from 2015-16 to 2018-19. The farmers, people working in unorganised sectors and individuals under BPL and EWS category are eligible for availing CLSS subsidy subject to due diligence by PLIs.                                           ******
