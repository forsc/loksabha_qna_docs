ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments.  The State Governments undertake assessment of damages and provide   financial   relief   in   the   wake   of   12 notified natural disasters, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the established procedure in case of disaster of severe nature. On receipt of memorandum from the State for any notified natural disaster, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) is constituted and deputed for an on-the-spot assessment of damage and requirement of funds for relief operations, as per the extant items and norms.  The report of the IMCT is considered by the Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC). Thereafter, the High Level Committee (HLC) approves the final quantum of financial assistance. 	The State Government of Bihar has not sought any financial assistance under NDRF for drought during the current financial year. However, the State Government of Bihar sought financial assistance under NDRF for flood during 2020. The High Level Committee in its meeting held on 11.02.2021 approved the following assistance to Bihar for flood of 2020: •	Rs. 1255.27 crore from NDRF subject to the adjustment of 50% of balance available in the SDRF account for the flood 2020.•	Air Bills for utilizing the services of IAF helicopters for rescue and relief, as per actual, based on the bills raised by the IAF.	Distribution of relief at the ground rests with the State Government.	Crop loss due to wild animals, including Neel Gais, can be covered by the State Government under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). The State Government of Bihar is not implementing PMFBY since 2018-19. However, the State Government of Bihar is implementing its own scheme, namely, Bihar Rajya Fasal Sahayata Yojana from its own Budget.	The State Government of Bihar has reported that to repel Neel Gais and other crops damaging animals, Animal Deterrent Bio Acoustic Machines are being distributed through State Mechanization Programme under subsidy.*****
