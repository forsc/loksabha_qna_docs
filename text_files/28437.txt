Two central tribal universities namely Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Madhya Pradesh and Central Tribal University of Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh are already operational.In pursuance of Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act 2014, the process of establishment of Central Tribal University Telangana was started simultaneously with that of Central University and Tribal University in Andhra Pradesh. However, land was delayed by the State Govt. of Telangana, therefore the process of Tribal University in Telangana was delinked with that of Central University and Tribal University in Andhra Pradesh. Subsequently, the land has been offered by the state govt. and the Site Selection Committee of MHRD selected the site at Bhupalpally District. DPR has been prepared and the inter-ministerial consultations have also been completed. The proposal has been moved for the financial approval of Department of Expenditure.*****
