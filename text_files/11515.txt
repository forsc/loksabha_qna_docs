                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) & (b): Government has introduced several new schemes with the purpose of improving livelihood, health and other dimensions of poverty . Some of the important schemes are as follows:(1) Ayushman Bharat: Finance Minister in his budget speech in 2018-19 announced two major initiatives as part of ‘‘Ayushman Bharat’’ programme aimed at making path breaking interventions to address health  sector  holistically, at primary, secondary and tertiary care systems  covering both prevention and health promotion. The scheme has two components.  Health and Wellness Centre (HWC)- by converting 1,50,000 Sub Centres to well equipped HWCs which will provide holistic primary care system covering both prevention and health promotion, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) which provides health protection cover to poor and vulnerable families. The scheme will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) with a benefit cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year. It would provide a cashless coverage for most of the secondary and tertiary services without any co-payment in public and private empaneled hospitals. All States except Delhi, WB, Odisha and Telangana have implemented the scheme. As on 31.01.2020 12.01 crore e-cards have been issues, 79.95 lakh hospital admission have been made and 21,662 (46% private) hospitals have been empanelled.(2) PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana: PM-KISAN Scheme was inaugurated on 24th February, 2019. It provides for transfer of an amount of Rs.6000/- per year in three equal installments each of Rs. 2000/- directly into the bank account of beneficiary farmer families. The Scheme initially covered only small and marginal farmer families with land holding upto 2 hectares as beneficiaries, subject to certain exclusion criteria for higher income status. The Government later extended the scheme with effect from 1st June 2019 to all farmer families irrespective of land holding size, subject to applicable exclusions. Since the launch of PM Kisan till now about 8.12 crore farmer families have been benefitted and more than Rs.48,937 crores has been released under the scheme.  (3) Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana : PM-KMY inaugurated by the Hon’ble  Prime Minister on 12th September, 2019 provides for payment of minimum pension of Rs.3000/- per month to the eligible small and marginal farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The monthly contribution by farmer ranges between Rs.55 to 200. Central Government will contribute an equal amount in the pension scheme. Till now 19, 19, 802 beneficiaries have been registered. (4) Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM): Government of India has introduced a pension scheme for unorganised workers namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) to ensure old age protection for Unorganised Workers. The unorganised workers whose monthly income is Rs 15,000/ per month or less,  belong to the entry age group of 18-40 years,  not  covered under New Pension Scheme (NPS), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) scheme or Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and not  an income tax payer are included. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, under which the subscriber would receive:(i) The Minimum Assured Pension of Rs.3000/- per month after attaining the age of 60 years, (ii) Family Pension - During the receipt of pension, if the subscriber dies, the spouse of the beneficiary shall be entitled to receive 50% of the pension. It is applicable only to spouse. (iii) If a beneficiary dies due to any cause (before age of 60 years), his/her spouse will be entitled to join and continue the scheme. As on 03.02.2020 40,67,788 enrollments have been made in the scheme (source: labour.gov.in/pm-sym)(5) Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana –“Saubhagya” to ensure electrification of all willing households in the country in rural as well as urban areas. The beneficiaries for free electricity connections would be identified using Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data.(6) There are many other steps taken by the Government in number of other sectors during last three years directly or indirectly having an impact on poverty. These steps deal with different dimensions of poverty, viz, employment opportunities, self-employment, making essential commodity and services available at cheaper cost and providing health, water and sanitation facilities. (c) & (d): The official poverty estimates are based on Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the M/o Statistics and Program Implementation. The poverty estimates for 2011-12 following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology was computed and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. According to this Press Note, the number of persons living below poverty line in India was estimated as 27 crore (21.9%) in 2011-12.*****
