ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :	Yes, Sir.  Government of India launched Pradhan  Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana– Saubhagya in October, 2017 to achieve universal household electrification by providing  last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all households in rural and all poor households in urban areas across the country.  As informed by the States, 2.628 crore households were electrified up to 31.03.2019 across the country, since launch of the scheme on 11.10.2017. State-wise detail is given at Annexure.(c) & (d) :	The subsidies to specified category of consumers are provided by the State Governments.  The Electricity Act, 2003 provides in Section 65 that if the State Government proposes to grant subsidy to any class of consumers it shall make available funds for this in advance to the concerned distribution company.   The State Governments have been advised that it they propose to give subsidies they should give it through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).  The tariff policy also mandates that direct subsidy is a better way to subsidize poorer consumer rather than cross subsidy (Clause 8.3 Tariff Policy 2016). ********
