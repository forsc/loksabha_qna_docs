ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during the year 2015-16, with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. It is an umbrella scheme, consisting of two major components being implemented by the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), and Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP).  HKKP, in turn, consists of four sub-components, being Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI), Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, and Ground Water (GW) Development.  In addition, PMKSY also consists of two components being implemented by other Departments/Ministries. Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component is being implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, while Watershed Development component (WDC) of PMKSY is being implemented by Department of Land Resources. During last three years, central assistance released to Odisha under different components of PMKSY is tabulated as below:Sl. No.	Component of PMKSY	Central assistance released during 2018-2021 to Odisha  (Rs. in crore)1.	Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Program (AIBP)  including Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM)	324.542.	Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) –	  	a.Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI)	- 	b.Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR))	34.54 	c. Ground Water (GW)	-3.	Per Drop More Crop	115.004.	Watershed Conservation 	187.03 	Total	661.11 Further, planning, design and implementation of water resources projects is taken up by the State Governments as per their priorities and availability of funds. Some of these projects are included for partial financial assistance under the existing schemes of Government of India, including PMKSY. Thus, inclusion of the projects under the different components of PMKSY is based on conformity of the proposal with the laid down norms of the component, availability of funds, etc. and not based on invitation of applications.  (c) Monitoring and maintenance of database for the different components of PMKSY is primarily based on the irrigation potential created. Thus the requisite details regarding number of beneficiaries, including those in Kalahandi and Nuapada districts of Odisha, are not being monitored at Government of India level. However, as per information provided by Government of Odisha, district-wise details about number of beneficiaries under various projects of Odisha funded under AIBP, are as under:Sl. No.	Name of the Project	District	Beneficiary (Nos)1	Subarnarekha	Mayurbhanja, Balasore	5,03,0002	Ret	Kalahandi	5,1453	Kanupur	Keonjhar	1,44,8884	Rukura	Sundargarh	8,7235	Integrated Anandpur Barrage Project	Balasore/Keonjhar	3,95,2686	Lower Indra	Nuapada	1,33,4287	Upper Indravati Extension	Kalahandi	21,8938	Telangiri	Koraput	65,551*****
