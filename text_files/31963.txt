ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (b): As per Section 6 (a) of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA, 2003) read with Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Amendment Rules, 2011, there is prohibition on sale of tobacco products to and by persons below the age of 18. In the draft Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) (Amendment) Bill, 2020, hosted in public domain for pre-legislative consultation, there is a proposal for increasing the minimum age limit from 18 to 21 years by amending Section 6 (a). The draft COTP (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was hosted in public domain for pre-legislative consultation. The Ministry has received representations, comments and suggestions on the draft Bill, which are under examination. (c) to (d): As per the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS 2), 2016-17, conducted among 15 years and above there is a significant increase of one year in the mean age at initiation of tobacco use from 17.9 years in GATS 1 (2009-10) to 18.9 years in GATS 2 (2016-17). Further, as per the National Fact Sheet of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS-4), 2019, conducted among 13-15-year-old school-going children, there has been a decline in the current use of tobacco by 42% (from 14.6% in 2009 to 8.5 % in 2019). GYTS-4, 2019 data also reveals that the median age at initiation of cigarette and bidi smoking, and smokeless tobacco use were 11.5 years, 10.5 years and 9.9 years respectively. Public Health is a State subject and the primary responsibility for enforcement of the Act, lies with the State Governments. Central Government in collaboration with State Governments are taking necessary measures for effective implementation of these provisions of COTPA, 2003, and Guidelines for Tobacco Free Educational Institution 2019, to dissuade young children and youth from tobacco use.********
