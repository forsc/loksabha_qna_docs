                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): The Railway does not have any scheme called the Rail Mobile Water Scheme. However, Indian Railways continuously endeavours to ensure availability of adequate drinking water to travelling passengers across its network including in the state of West Bengal. Safe and hygienic drinking water is supplied through ‘Rail Neer’ Packaged Drinking Water bottles, other approved brands of Packaged Drinking Water bottles, Water Vending Machines and water booths/taps available at stations. Instructions have been issued to adopt the “Uniform Drinking Water Quality Monitoring Protocol” issued by Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation in February 2013 so that drinking water supplied to the Railway passengers at stations through water taps is suitably treated, as per requirement, before the exit point of supply.(b) to (d): Do not arise.*****
