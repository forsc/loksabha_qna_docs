MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)  to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 341 BY SHRI P. RAVEENDRANATH KUMAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2019 REGARDING GAUGE CONVERSION PROJECT (a) to (d):  Yes, Sir. 05 Gauge Conversion projects including Madurai-Bodinayakkanur gauge conversion project covering a length of 700 Km,  in the State of Tamil Nadu are in different stages of execution, out of which, 573 Km length has been commissioned and work taken up in balance 127 Km length. Madurai-Bodinayakkanur gauge conversion project (90.41 Km) was sanctioned in 2008-09 and the latest anticipated cost of the project is     ` 450 crore. An expenditure of   ` 101.11 crore has been incurred on this project upto March, 2019 and an outlay of ` 100 crore has been proposed  for the Financial Year 2019-20. Works on this project have been taken up in entire length. The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, cyclones, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation conditions of working agencies/contractors etc., all these factors affect the completion time and cost  of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        *****
