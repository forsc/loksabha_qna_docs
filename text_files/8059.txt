The Government has received proposals to declare 53 stretches aggregating total length of 5313 km as National Highways in the State of Rajasthan. The Ministry has declared 3 stretches with length of 541 km as NHs and has accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for 50 stretches for consideration for declaration as new National Highways depending upon the outcome of Detailed Project Report (DPR). However, the Government is in the process of framing revised guidelines for declaration of State Roads as National Highways based on the inter-se priority, traffic density and availability of funds.
