(a) & (b):  The Indian Air Force is adequately equipped to cater for the threat environment that exists and is ready to meet the role assigned to it.  Modernization of fighter fleet in the IAF is an ongoing process and a two-pronged approach has been adopted by midlife upgradation of legacy aircraft to retain their operational relevance and induction of new aircraft.(c)  Augmentation of capabilities of Indian Air Force by way of procurement and indigenous production including its modernisation depends upon national security, strategic objectives and operational requirements of defence forces and is reviewed by the Government from time to time.
