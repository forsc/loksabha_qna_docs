                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a): The Government is implementing the e-Courts Mission Mode Project for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of District and Subordinate Courts across the country in association with the eCommittee, Supreme Court of India. The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase-II commenced its implementation in 2015. The target set out under the project is computerization of 16,845 District and Subordinate Courts, which has been completed. Against the financial outlay of Rs.1670 crores for this Phase, the Government has released a sum of Rs. 1249 crore as on date to various organizations involved in the implementation of the project. This includes a sum of Rs. 955.86 crore released to all High Courts, out of which a sum of Rs.761.32 crore has been utilized.	In respect of the High Courts of Punjab & Haryana and High Courts in the North Eastern States, including the State of Assam, the status of implementation of eCourts Project Phase-II is as under:High Court	State (s)	Number of District and Subordinate Courts computerized 	Funds released by Government as on date (Rs.

Crore)Punjab & Haryana	Punjab and Haryana	1018	49.58	39.42Guwahati 	Arunachal Pradesh	15	9.14	3.49Guwahati	Assam	383	47.5	38.10Guwahati	Mizoram	61	6.34	5.79Guwahati	Nagaland	37	5.63	5.60Manipur	Manipur	37	6.60	3.42Meghalaya	Meghalaya	39	7.71	6.71Sikkim	Sikkim	19	4.18	2.70Tripura	Tripura	69	10.22	9.69(b):  Disposal of cases in courts is primarily within the domain of judiciary. Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing. However, through computerization of 16,845 District & Subordinate Courts and ICT enablement under the eCourts Project Phase-II, several services have been provided to litigants, lawyers and Judiciary which facilitate expeditious delivery of judicial services. eCourts services such as details of case registration, cause list, case status, daily orders & final judgments are available to litigants and advocates through eCourts web portal, Judicial Service Centres (JSC) in all computerized courts, eCourts Mobile App, email service, SMS push & pull services. National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) for District & Subordinate Courts, created as an online platform under the Project, provides information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of computerized district and subordinate courts of the country. Currently, all stakeholders including Judicial Officers can access case status information in respect of over 12.68 crore pending and disposed cases and more than 10.56 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts. Video Conferencing facility has been enabled between 3240 court complexes & 1272 corresponding jails. (c): Yes, Sir. The details of implementation of eCourts Project Phase-II have been provided in Part (a) above.
