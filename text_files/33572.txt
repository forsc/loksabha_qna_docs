                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)       Poverty Line was last revised in 2009. Since then, it has not been updated and not used for identification of beneficiaries of the programmes. Ministry of Rural Development identifies the beneficiaries on the basis of Socio-Economic Census held in 2011. The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households on the basis of the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), which was conducted in 2011 and the Awaas+ 2018 survey (conducted to identify eligible households claiming to be left out of SECC 2011). Eligible households under PMAY-G are selected using housing deprivation, automatic inclusion and exclusion parameters. The Amroha Parliamentary Constituency comprises of the Jyotiba Phule Nagar and Hapur districts. The number of automatically included households and deprived households identified under SECC 2011, from which the beneficiaries of the schemes are drawn, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, especially in the two districts of Amroha Parliamentary Constituency, is given below:                                (Units in nos.)State/District	     Automatic included             Deprived Households of more                     households 	            than deprivation Uttar Pradesh	       68190	                    1,03,81,355Jyotiba Phule Nagar	 190	                         38,004Hapur*	                 192	                         38,486   *Hapur and Garhmukteshwar tehsils  (b) to (d) Rural Housing is part of the mandate and responsibility of the State Governments, therefore,  the State Governments are also implementing their own housing schemes. For example, Mukhyamantri Awaas Yojana is being run by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh and it aims to provide benefits to those households which are left out of the scope of implementation of PMAY-G in the State. PMAY-G is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments to provide benefits of the housing to eligible beneficiaries. Accordingly, the details are being provided in respect of PMAY-G only.The total central share of funds allocated and released by the Ministry under PMAY-G to the State of Uttar Pradesh during each of the last five years is given as under:Year	       Allocation (Rs in Crore)	Release (Rs in Crore)2016-17	           4,328.91	           2,239.802017-18	           2,985.45	           4,948.062018-19	           2,335.93	           2,775.862019-20	           1,298.50	           1,145.642020-21	           5,274.66	           4,830.90 Further, the number of people benefited (to whom houses have been sanctioned), under the PMAY-G in the State of Uttar Pradesh, and in the two districts of Amroha Parliamentary Constituency during each of the last five years is given as under: (Houses sanctioned units in nos.)State/District	         2016-17	2017-18	     2018-19	2019-20	        2020-21Uttar Pradesh	      1,17,670	       7,62,797	    3,84,154	  1,78,341	7,30,523Jyotiba Phule Nagar	   169	             58	        0	     0	           1,771Hapur	                    28	              2   	0	     0	              19 The number of eligible households from SECC 2011 and Awaas+ database that have been provided houses since inception of PMAY-G on 01.04.2016 till 03.02.2022 are given below.
