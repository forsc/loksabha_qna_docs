ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c):  Education being in the concurrent list of Constitution, Centre and States are equally responsible for providing quality education to all. The implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Therefore, the implementation of this Policy is led by various bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, Union and State Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools, and HEIs. The policy provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. NEP also provides for careful planning, joint monitoring and collaborative implementation by Central and States for execution of this policy. Accordingly, Ministry of Education, other relevant Ministries/Departments, State/UT Governments and implementing agencies under their purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020.*****
