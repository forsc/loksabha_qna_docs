ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) To contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways had discontinued all regular passengers carrying trains w.e.f. 23.03.2020 and only special trains, keeping in view concerns and suggestions of State Governments and health advisories, were being operated. Since, November-2021, Mail/Express train services are being operated as per rationalized time-table and regular numbers. Besides, train services are being enhanced in a phased manner. Further, Indian Railways do not run train services on State-wise/district-wise basis as Railway network straddles across State/district boundaries. Accordingly, at present, Narmadapuram station is being served by 25 pairs and Narsinghpur station by 32 pairs of train services.(b) to (d) Demands from public representative including from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for these stoppages and have not been found commercially justified, at present. ******
