(b):	Public Health is a State subject.  However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of States/UTs through technical and financial support.In order to combat the major Non Communicable Disease (NCDs) including cancer, Government of India is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) for interventions up to district level under National Health Mission., with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment and follow up to non-communicable disease including cancer. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Disease (NCDs), including cancer, 637 NCD clinics at districts level and 4460 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level has been set up under NPCDCS.

(c) & (d):	The treatment of cancer in many of the state and Central Government institutions is free for BPL patients and subsidized for others.
