Under the Scheme, 157 new medical colleges have been approved in three phases and 71 are already functional. The details are at Annexure-II. No proposal was received from State Government of Madhya Pradesh for establishment of a medical college at Jhabua district.

The said regulation also has the provision for lowering the minimum marks by the Government when sufficient number of candidates belonging to respective categories fail to secure prescribed minimum marks for any academic year.
