ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) & (b): As per provisions of Section 32 of the Waqf Act 1995 as amended, general superintendence of all waqf properties in a State is vested with the State Waqf Board (SWB) and the Waqf Board is empowered to manage the waqf property and take legal action against unauthorized occupation and encroachment of such properties. Further, as per Section 54 and 55 of the Waqf Act, SWB may take action for the removal of encroachment from the encroacher. As per section 51(1A) of the Waqf Act, any sale, gift, exchange, mortgage or transfer of the waqf property has been declared void ab-initio w.e.f 1st November, 2013. As per the available information with Central Waqf Council (CWC) received from various State Waqf Boards (SWBs), State wise position of number of Waqf Properties facing encroachment is given at Annexure.(c): The Central Government comprehensively amended Waqf Act 1995 in 2013 giving more powers to SWBs to deal with encroachment on waqf properties. The amended provisions inter alia include stringent definition of “encroacher”; mandate to State Governments to appoint Survey Commissioners and complete the survey of waqf properties in a time bound manner; rigorous imprisonment for alienation of waqf properties without prior approval of the SWBs; alienation of waqf property to be cognizable and non-bailable offence; three member Tribunals with extended jurisdiction to deal with  disputes concerning eviction of a tenant. Central Government monitors compliance of various provisions of Waqf Act by State Governments/(SWBs) from time to time. The last such national conference was held in New Delhi on 29.07.2019.(d) & (e): As per the Waqf Act 1995 as amended, the SWBs are constituted by the concerned State Government to manage the waqf properties situated in the state. SWBs are solely authorized to take action against its officials involving in activities of encroachment or sale of the Waqf Properties. Complaints regarding the encroachment, sale, alienation or transfer of the waqf properties are received in CWC from time to time and the same are taken up with concerned Waqf Board authorities for taking appropriate action for the removal of the encroachment and the retrieval of the waqf properties. 	Further, in order to protect the waqf properties and to prevent encroachment, a dedicated online portal called WAMSI (Waqf Assets Management System of India) has been developed. So far 5,94,139 immovable waqf properties have been registered on the portal. Moreover, an intensive campaign for digitization of records of waqf estates has been conducted from 5th July to 15 Oct, 2019 as a result of which 98.99% records have been digitized. The SWBs have also been advised to undertake GIS Mapping of waqf properties on top priority.  (f): Presently, the Waqf Act 1995 is in force which was amended in 2013.*******
