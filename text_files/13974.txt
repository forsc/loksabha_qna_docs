                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (d) The Anganwadi Services Scheme has a monitoring system component to track the physical progress of the scheme in respect of various input processes, output and impact indicators through a standardized Management Information System (MIS) through regular reports on monthly, quarterly and half yearly basis. To strengthen the monitoring of Anganwadi Services Scheme, revised MIS known as ICDS-Rapid Reporting System (ICDS-RRS) has also been introduced for capturing the data of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) online. Under the ICDS-RRS, AWC is assigned an 11 digit unique code and login password has been allotted at the supervisor level to submit the monthly progress report.In addition, under POSHAN Abhiyaan, ICDS-Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) enables data capture, ensures assigned service delivery and prompts for interventions wherever required.  The software allows capture of data from the field on the mobile phone of the Anganwadi Worker. It enables collection of information on ICDS service delivery interventions and its impact on nutrition outcomes in beneficiaries.  ICDS-Common Application Software inter-alia captures data on weight and height of children, opening of Anganwadi Centres, distribution of Take Home Ration and attendance of children for pre-school education at Anganwadi. This data/information is then available on web-based ICDS-CAS dashboard on a near real time basis, for monitoring, to the supervisory staff at Block, District, State and National level, for action and decision making at their end.  The dashboard displays data and provides reports on various programme areas to the administrative officers to interpret and use the information for improving service delivery.  State-wise status of implementation of ICDS-RRS and ICDS-CAS including state of Gujarat is at Annexure-I &II respectively. National Informatics Centre Services Inc., company under National Informatics Centre, has been assigned with the task of design, development, implementation and maintenance of ICDS-RRS system.The mechanism to implement the project in States /UTs include regular review through Video Conference, meetings and field visits by officers of the Ministry/State Governments/UT Administrations.(e)	The child beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are provided Supplementary Nutrition in the form of Hot Cooked Meals (HCM) or Take Home Ration(THR) as per the guidelines of the Scheme. Monthly Village Health and Sanitation Day and Community Based Events are organised by States/UTs to improve status of nutrition of children. In addition,children (3-6 years) are provided non-formal Pre-School Education service in all AWCs. Funds @ Rs. 5,000/- per AWC per annum is provided to States/UTs for imparting non-formal pre-school education to the children.ICDS-CAS, under POSHAN Abhiyaan, enables growth monitoring of children with the help of auto plotting of growth chart on the mobile application. It enables monitoring of nutritional status of children across the country on monthly basis. SMS (Short Message Service) is an integrated part of ICDS-CAS application wherein system generates alerts on predefined conditions such as static/negative growth that are sent to parents and field functionaries for cognizance********* ANNEXURE-I STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2622 FOR 06.03.2020ASKED BY SHRI MOHANBHAI KALYANJI KUNDARIYAREGARDING DIGITISATION OF ANGANWADI CENTRES State-wise status of Anganwadi Centres assigned 11 Digit Unique Code on ICDS-RRSS No.	States/UTs	Number of Anganwadi Centres		Sanctioned	* Operational	Assigned 11 digit unique code1	A & N Islands	720	720	7172	Andhra Pradesh	55607	55607	556073	Arunachal Pradesh	6225	6225	62154	Assam	62153	62153	618095	Bihar	115009	106953	1069536	Chandigarh	450	450	4507	Chhattisgarh	52474	51414	514148	Dadra & N Haveli	302	302	3029	Daman & Diu	107	107	10210	Delhi	10897	10897	1089711	Goa	1262	1262	126212	Gujarat	53029	53029	5302913	Haryana	25962	25962	2596214	Himachal Pradesh	18925	18925	1892515	Jammu & Kashmir	30765	28460	2761216	Jharkhand	38432	38432	3843217	Karnataka	65911	65911	6591118	Kerala	33318	33244	3317419	Ladakh	1173	1139	113920	Lakshadweep	107	107	10721	Madhya Pradesh	97135	97135	9713522	Maharashtra	110486	110219	10970823	Manipur	11510	11510	1151024	Meghalaya	5896	5896	589625	Mizoram	2244	2244	224426	Nagaland	3980	3980	027	Odisha	74154	72587	7258728	Puducherry	855	855	85529	Punjab	27314	27295	2729530	Rajasthan	62010	61974	6138331	Sikkim	1308	1308	130832	Tamil Nadu	54439	54439	5443933	Telangana	35700	35634	3563434	Tripura	10145	9911	988535	Uttar Pradesh	190145	187997	18799736	Uttarakhand	20067	20067	2006737	West Bengal	119481	116446	116446	Total	1399697	1380796	1374408 *  As per Monthly Progress Reports(MPR), (31st December, 2019) submitted by States/UTs ANNEXURE-II STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2622 FOR 06.03.2020ASKED BY SHRI MOHANBHAI KALYANJI KUNDARIYA REGARDING DIGITISATION OF ANGANWADI CENTRESState-wise status of ICDS-CAS UsersS.no	States/UTs	Total number of ICDS-CAS mobile users 1.
