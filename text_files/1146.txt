ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Floods are natural calamity that lndia faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The frequent occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out bursts. The interlinking of rivers project has been proposed to divert the surplus waters to deficit areas through inter-basin water transfer links. The floods can be moderated to a certain extent due to the storages created for Inter Basin Water Transfer.(b)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned is given at Annexure.(c)   No rivers in Haryana State are covered under the Interlinking of Rivers project of NPP. However, the proposed Yamuna-Rajasthan link under Himalayan Component envisages benefits to Haryana State.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †1083 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.06.2019 REGARDING “FLOODS DUE TO NON-INTERLINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
