ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) As per a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai in association with CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited in December 2014, the tidal power potential of the country is estimated at around 12,455 MW.(b)&(c) Earlier efforts in the country for harnessing tidal power were not successful due to high capital cost ranging from Rs. 30 crore to Rs. 60 crore per MW. Two tidal energy projects, namely the 240 MW La Rance station in France (installed in 1966) and the 254 MW Sihwa plant in the South Korea (installed in 2011), constitute more than 90% of the total installed capacity of tidal energy in the world.(d)&(e) At present, due to very high capital cost, the Government of India has not put in place any policy or programme for production of tidal energy. However, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under its Research, Design, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) programme provides financial support to academic institutions, research and development organisations and industry for research and development in renewable energy, including, inter-alia, for developing Ocean Energy technologies.*****
