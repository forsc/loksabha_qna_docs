                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): Presently, Indian Railways have taken up 498 Railway projects of length 49,069 km, costing `6.75 lakh crore, which are in different stages of execution/planning/sanction, out of which, commissioning of 8,979 km has been achieved and expenditure of `1.54 lakh crore incurred up to March, 2019. The 498 projects includes 55 Projects falling fully/partly in the State of Bihar of total length 4,953 km and costing `71,795 crore. Out of which 1,256 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `20,294 crore has been incurred till March 2019. Railway projects are sanctioned, based on demands raised by State Governments, Central Ministries, Members of Parliament, other public representatives and Railways’ own requirement, participation by State Government or private entities etc. They are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes.No standing instructions have been issued by Indian Railways to State Government(s) including Bihar that States should come forward to adopt cost sharing system to ensure time-bound completion of long pending Railway schemes in their State. The concept of cost sharing in a project is decided on case to case basis at the time of sanctioning of project.   However, based on requests of State Governments/other stake holders on case to case basis, Ministry of Railways have embarked upon cooperative federalism by actively involving States in planning, development, financing and implementation of Railway projects through formation of State Joint Venture. Besides, States and other stack holders are being invited to participate in Railway projects to ensure expeditious execution through customer funding and cost sharing and/or providing land free of cost for the project.In Bihar State, out of total 55 projects, only 01 project is on cost sharing basis. Other States in which projects have been taken up on cost sharing basis are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Punjab, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.    *****
