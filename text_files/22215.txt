Further, an equivalent area of culturable wasteland shall be developed for agricultural purposes or an amount equivalent to the value of the land acquired shall be deposited with the appropriate Government for investment in agriculture for enhancing food-security. It stipulates that irrigated multi-cropped land is ordinarily not acquired for developmental projects. However, if it is compulsory to acquire as a last resort, an equivalent area of wasteland is developed and put under cultivation.The provisions of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013 are implemented by ‘appropriate Government’ defined under section 3 (e) of the said Act.The Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development does not centrally maintain information in respect of land acquired under various Acts for projects by the Central Ministries/ Departments and State Governments.                                         *****
