Public Hearing as part of the said Public Consultation has not been held. (c) to (e) As on date, no such challenge has been reported to the Ministry. Based on Terms of Reference issued for the project, EIA study mandates studies including (i) a comprehensive study on all existing developments, like, Ennore port, L&T shipyard etc, (ii) impact of construction of berths and breakwaters on the littoral drift, which causes the sand accretion and deposition in the region, (iii) shoreline change Management Plan covering the area from Ennore Creek to Pulicat Lake (iv) impact of proposed project on Ennore Shoals that were protecting the coast from Cyclone and Tsunami, (v) study on drainage pattern within and outside the port area including Ennore Creek, Pulicat Lake and Buckingham Canal (vi) biodiversity of the area, viz, estuary and coastal region, (vii) Socio-economic study in the surrounding villages of the project especially on the use of common property resources/Government lands.

Further, EIA and EMP studies along with Public Consultation report are appraised by Expert Appraisal Committee for their necessary recommendation. As per EIA Notification, 2006, as amended, deliberate concealment or submission of false/misleading information which is material to appraisal or decision on the application shall be liable for rejection, and cancellation of prior environmental clearance granted on that basis. *****
