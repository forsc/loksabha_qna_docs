ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) The climate model simulation studies done by various agencies including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) project possible linkages of climate change with frequency and intensity of weather related events. However, there is paucity of data to establish direct correlation of climate change with number of deaths that can be attributed to occurrence of natural disasters due to climate change. (c) India Meteorological Department (IMD) is doing monitoring, detection and forecasting of weather and climate including early warning for severe weather events such as, heavy rainfall, extreme temperature, cyclones etc. The forecasts and warnings are issued by IMD at the National, State and District levels. It has a network of State Meteorological Centres for better coordination with State and District Level Agencies. In order to meet specific requirements of flood forecasting, Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Jal Shakti, and IMD are operating Flood Meteorological Offices (FMOs) at thirteen locations in the country. CWC is working in close association with IMD and State Governments for timely flood forecast whenever the river water level rises above warning level. FMOs provide meteorological support to the CWC for issuing flood warnings well in advance in respect of the 43 rivers of India covering 146 river basins. CWC issues flood forecasts 6 hrs. to 30 hrs. in advance for 176 stations. IMD also issues early warning for Heat wave. IMD in collaboration with local health departments have started heat action plan in many parts of the country to forewarn about the heat waves and also advising action to be taken during such occasions.  National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and IMD are working with 23 states prone to high temperatures leading to heat-wave conditions to develop heat action plans. To mitigate impact of thunderstorms and associated severe weather phenomena, IMD issues three hourly nowcasts for about 600 stations in India on regular basis. IMD has three Area Cyclone Warning Centres at Chennai, Kolkata & Mumbai and four Cyclone Warning Centres at Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Thiruvananthapuram and Visakhapatnam for carrying out operational warning activities at state level and to carry out related research & development activities. The Government of India has also initiated the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) with a view to address cyclone risks in the country. The overall objective of the Project is to undertake suitable structural and non-structural measures to mitigate the effects of cyclones in the Coastal States and UTs of India.The NDMA has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters such as cyclones, floods and heat wave. National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) has been formulated to assist all stakeholders including State Governments in disaster risk management.(d) One meeting of the Executive Committee on Climate Change, which is to assist Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change (PMCCC) has been convened in 2019. *****
