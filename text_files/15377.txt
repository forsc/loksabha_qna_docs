ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (d):  In tune with the growth of  IT/ITeS sector in India; growth of Digital India program; increasing focus on cyber security & privacy for countering the ever increasing threats and also for compliance requirements, the demand for cyber security professionals is growing. The adoption of emerging technologies e.g. Cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) etc., is also expected to raise the requirement for cyber security. However, no such specific study has been conducted by MeitY. Cities like Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Gurugram, Noida, etc. are major IT & financial Hubs and are accordingly providing such growth opportunities.********
