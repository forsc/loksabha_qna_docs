                                                        MINISTER of AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):    Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) scheme is being implemented by Department of Commerce  for Specified Agriculture Products for providing assistance for the international component of freight to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products and assistance for the marketing of agricultural produces which is likely to result in higher exports of agriculture products in overseas markets. The Department of Commerce has several other schemes to promote exports, including exports of agricultural products,  viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the export promotion Schemes of APEDA, Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.  Further, subsidy is being extended under Operation Greens scheme of Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) for transportation of fruits and vegetable through Kisan Rail. Indian Railways are providing the transport subsidy directly to any applicants by way of charging 50% of their freight charges from them for transportation. (c) & (d):	India has a ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) with Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) under which individual ASEAN countries have provided tariff concessions to India on a variety of products including certain food and agricultural products. Other than AITIGA, India has bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with three ASEAN countries – India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), India-Malaysia CECA and India-Thailand FTA Early Harvest Scheme under which these countries have provided tariff concessions to India on different products. 	With a view to facilitate enhanced market access for Indian products in ASEAN markets, Department of Commerce is engaging with ASEAN for review of AITIGA and is also exploring bilateral Preferential Trade Agreements with certain ASEAN countries.*******
