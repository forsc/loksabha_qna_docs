CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor the CSR activities of the company based on the recommendation of its CSR Committee. The entire CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in MCA21 registry. The existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide sufficient safeguards. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. All data related to CSR filed by companies in the MCA21 registry including district-wise and State-wise is available in public domain at www.csr.gov.in.
