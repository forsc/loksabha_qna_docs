MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) The Centrally Sponsored Scheme, ‘Saakshar Bharat’, the new variant of the NationalLiteracy Mission, launched on 8.9.2009, aimed to promote and strengthen Adult Education,specially for women, by extending educational options to those adults who having lost theopportunity of access to formal education and crossed the standard age for receiving sucheducation, now feel a need for learning of any type, including, literacy, basic education,vocational education and continuing education in 15 plus age group. The scheme wasimplemented in the rural areas of 410 districts in 26 States and one UT that had adult femaleliteracy rate of 50 per cent and below as per Census 2001, and including left wing extremismaffected districts, irrespective of their literacy rates, with special focus on women and otherdisadvantaged groups. The main goal of the scheme was to raise the literacy rate of thecountry to 80% and reduce the gender gap to 10 percentage points by the end of XIIth FiveYear Plan by covering 70 million adult non-literates under basic literacy with prime focus onwomen, SCs, STs, Minorities & other disadvantaged groups in rural areas.
