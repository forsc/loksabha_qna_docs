ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a)  to (f):  Prior to disinvestment of Air India, LTC 80 was a scheme offered by Air India for booking air tickets when Government employees availed LTC. The air fare is neither regulated nor established by the Government. Under the provision of sub rule (1) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, every air transport undertaking engaged in scheduled air services is required to establish tariff having regard to all relevant factors, including the cost of operations, characteristics of services, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing staff. The prices are accordingly fixed by the airlines keeping in view the market forces including, inter-alia, the operating cost, demand, seasonality, sustainability etc. In view of the disinvestment of Air India, Department of Expenditure has issued guidelines on 31.12.2021 and 16.02.2022 for air travel on Government account, both domestic (including LTC) and international, where the Government of India bears the cost of air passage.  As per the said guidelines, travel can be made by any private airlines, subject to tickets being purchased from the three Authorized Travel Agents viz. i) M/s Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited (BLCL); ii) M/s Ashok Travels & Tours (ATT); and iii) Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd. (IRCTC).;******
