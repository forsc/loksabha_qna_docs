ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)	to (c)	The call drop in a mobile network can happen due to many reasons including characteristics of radio propagation for wireless communication, non-availability of sites due to acquisition problems etc. The occurrence of call drops is found to be common in mobile networks across the world with varying degree of occurrences. Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in India are required to ensure that the call drop rate in their mobile networks remains within the benchmarks laid down by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).		TRAI has been monitoring the performance of TSPs for the License Service Area (LSA) as a whole, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs) submitted by them against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI. TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark. 	TRAI has issued “The Standards of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service (Fifth Amendment) Regulations, 2017” effective from 1st October 2017. These Regulations have prescribed two revised stringent parameters for assessing call drop in mobile network, viz. Drop Call Rate (DCR) Spatial Distribution measure (benchmark = 2%) implies that at least 90% of cells in the network should perform better than specified 2% benchmark on at least 90% of days. Similarly, another new parameter, DCR Temporal Distribution measure (benchmark = 3%) will give confidence that on at least 90% of days, network performed better than specified 3% benchmark for at least 97% of the cells.	Moreover, in order to obtain direct feedback from subscribers on call drop, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has launched an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) wherein around 5.60 crore subscribers have been individually contacted since December 2016. Out of these, 73.11 lakh subscribers have participated in the survey. The feedback is shared with the TSPs for taking corrective actions in a time bound manner. As a result, about 1.72 lakh individual cases of call drops have been resolved so far and around 7,920 Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed by the TSPs specifically to resolve the call drop issues received through IVRS.
