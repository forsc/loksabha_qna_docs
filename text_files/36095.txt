(ii) AAI received bids for all nine FTO slots in March 2021 despite the airline sector going through a serious financial crisis due to Covid.  (iii) AAI issued award letters on 31 May 2021 and 29 October 2021 for nine FTOs to be established at five airports at Belagavi (Karnataka), Jalgaon (Maharashtra), Kalaburagi (Karnataka), Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh) and Lilabari (Assam). Soft launch of two FTOs at Kalabuargi was done on 15 August 2021. (iv) In the second round of FTO creation, tender process is in progress for establishing 15 FTOs at 10 Airports namely Cooch Behar, Tezu, Jharsuguda, Deoghar, Meerut, Kishangarh, Hubli, Kadapa, Bhavnagar and Salem Airports.;(c) and (d) Currently, there is no proposal in the Government to set up a flying training institute in Telangana.******
