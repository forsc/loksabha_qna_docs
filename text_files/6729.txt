In KKNPP Unit-2, increased vibration in generator stator was observed at higher power levels. The unit is therefore presently being operated at about 65% power. The generator stator is planned to be replaced during the next refueling outage, which is planned from December 2019. KKNPP Units 1&2 commenced commercial operation on December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2017 respectively. The units have since generated about 21648 and 10636 Million Units of electricity till October 2019 respectively. The total number of outages due to issues related to mechanical equipment since commercial operation have been 6 and 8 in Units-1& 2 respectively. (c)	Yes, Sir.(d)	In nuclear power plant systems, security arrangements are in place which secures the plant from cyber-attack. These security measures include authorization, authentication & access control mechanisms, strict configuration control and surveillance. Additionally, these nuclear power plant systems are isolated from internet and are not accessible from administrative network.*****
