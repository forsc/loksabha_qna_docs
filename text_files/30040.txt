ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL & PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (d): Bharat Gold Mines Limited (BGML), a Public Sector Undertaking incorporated in April, 1972 under the administrative control of the then Department of Mines (now M/o Mines) with its office at Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), Karnataka. It was engaged in (i) mining and production of gold mainly in KGF and (ii) few smaller operations in Andhra Pradesh. On its operations becoming economically unviable, BIFR vide its order dated 12.06.2000 ordered winding up of BGML. Operations of BGML were closed with effect from 01.03.2001 under Section 25 (O) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in terms of Ministry of Labour’s order dated 29.01.2001. The Cabinet on 27.07.2006 approved sale of assets of BGML through open global tender. The matter went into litigation and Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 09.07.2013 permitted UoI to proceed with the global tender as per decision taken by the Cabinet. All the mining leases of BGML have expired and application for renewal of mines in Karnataka is pending whereas Govt. of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) has determined/terminated all three mining leases. Besides, as per recent amendment of MMDR Act if the mining lease is not determined then the mining lease will expire in 2023. A meeting was held to discuss the future course of action w.r.t. BGML, wherein, it was decided that, the department may explore other option for BGML. This was needed to be preceded by exploration of dumps and mining area to assess the resources and Techno Economic Feasibility Study (TEFS) of the same. Accordingly, Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited (MECL) was assigned for exploration of dumps & two unmined blocks in KGF, MECL submitted its report in 2018. MECL has also done exploration in Betraswamy block of BGML and submitted its report in March, 2021. Further, Non-Ferrous Technology Development Centre (NFTDC) was assigned TEFS for extraction of gold from tailing dumps of BGML. The TEFS report of NFTDC has been received in January, 2021. Based on these reports, Management Consultant has suggested that BGML does not look for operationalization on its own.(e) :  No, Sir.(f) :  Does not arise in view of the reply given to (a)-(d) above.*****
