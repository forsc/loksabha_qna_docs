                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) and (b) : Government of India has many sector specific schemes to boost infrastructure including that in coastal region of the country. The Sagarmala Programme, the flagship programme of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways focuses on the following:a.	Port Modernization & New Port Development: De-bottlenecking and capacity expansion of existing ports and development of new greenfield ports.b.	Port Connectivity Enhancement: Enhancing the connectivity of the ports to the hinterland, optimizing cost and time of cargo movement through multi-modal logistics solutions including domestic waterways (inland water transport and coastal shipping).c.	Port-linked Industrialization: Developing port-proximate industrial clusters and Coastal Economic Zones to reduce logistics cost and time of EXIM and domestic cargo.d.	Coastal Community Development: Promoting sustainable development of coastal communities through skill development & livelihood generation activities, fisheries development, coastal tourism etc. Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of Major Ports is an ongoing process. It involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting larger vessels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. As a result, the cargo handling capacity of the Major Ports has gone up-to 1534.91 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) as on 31-3-2020. This is adequate to handle the present level of EXIM and Coastal cargo and also increased requirements in near future. Ministry of Railways has also undertaken several port connectivity projects under the Participative policy which are aimed at strengthening port-rail connectivity and to facilitate seamless movement from/to the ports.Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken up construction of roads in border / coastal areas as part of Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-1.  Out of 2,000 kms of Border and International Connectivity roads targeted for award under Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-1, 977 kms length has been awarded by National Highways Authority (NHAI), out of which 849 kms length has already been completed.  Against the target for completion of 2,000 kms of Coastal and Port Connectivity roads, awarded 168 Kms length out of which 14 km has already been completed. (c), (d) and (e) :   According to Ease of Doing Business (EODB) 2020 by World Bank (available on www.doingbusinessreport.org) India`s latest ranking on Trading Across Border in 2020 is 68 while the same in 2019 was 80 and in 2018 it was 146, showing a consistent improvement.A number of measures have been taken for facilitating EXIM trade, such as reduction in gate-in window time, installation of RFID at port gate, replacement of manual forms with electronic forms, implementation of Direct Port Entry (DPE) and Direct Port Delivery (DPD) etc. Port community System (PCS 1x) has been implemented to integrate the electronic flow of information and function as the centralized hub for Indian Ports through common interface.*********
