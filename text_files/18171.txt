The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), under Ministry of Power is maintaining two power stations at Teesta Low Dam-III and Teesta Low Dam-IV  projects and has carried out protective measures like construction of concrete cladded wire crate works, gabion walls, catch water drains, breast walls, anchoring etc., as a part of exhaustive Reservoir Rim Treatment (RRT).
