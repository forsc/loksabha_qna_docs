MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): To promote paperless office work with a view to avoiding spread of Covid-19, the use of a digital workplace solution called e-office has been intensified in the Ministry of Education and the autonomous organizations such as Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, Central Board of Secondary Education and National Council of Educational Research and Training.  Accordingly, file movements, processing of leave applications etc. are done through e-office. Correspondence through e-mail has also been increased.  In the educational institutions, transaction of curriculum is done through online mode and use of digital devices is also encouraged. To the extent possible, official meetings are organized through video conferencing mode to minimize physical interface.      	(c) to (f): KVS has been taking steps to reduce paper usage by uploading all relevant forms on the website. Further, official processes like admissions, transfers etc. have been made online. Assessments are also now being carried out online especially in the wake of COVID-19. *****
