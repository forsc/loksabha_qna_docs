Out of these, girls constitute more than 50% of the beneficiaries. It is proposed to increase the number of beneficiaries under the three Scholarship Schemes namely Pre-Matric, Post Matric and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship Schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Minority Affairs over the next five years by popularising them among the six centrally notified minority communities and to earmark 50% of the scholarships for girls instead of 30% at present. Further measures will be taken to increase renewal of scholarships and minimize the dropout rates particularly under the pre-matric and post-matric Schemes to ensure that a child once registered under these Schemes completes school education or the training in the vocation of her/his choice.*****
