ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (d) Bhawanipatna - Muniguda - Bissamcuttack - Rayagada - Parvatipuram - Vizianagaram stretches and Gunupur - Baliguda (Phulbani) via Padmapur - Gudari - Chandrapur stretches are not National Highways. Ministry keeps on receiving proposals from various State Governments/UTs, etc., including from the State of Odisha for declaration / up-gradation of State roads as National Highways (NHs).  Ministry considers declaration of some of the State roads as NHs from time to time based on the requirements of connectivity, inter-se priority and availability of funds subject to fulfillment of criteria for declaration of new NHs.*****
