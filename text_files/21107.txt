                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b):	Yes Sir. Government of India has been taking various steps in bringing strategic interventions in market reforms for rapid agricultural development and increasing farmers’ income in the light of the problems faced by the farmers due to COVID-19 situation as well as natural climatic changes affecting ready crops including in certain areas of Andhra Pradesh, if any. Some of these major steps are as follows:i).	Brought out two Acts namely The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and Empowerment and Protection of farmers for Agreements of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.ii).	Allocating Rs.20 lakh crore package for ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ which also includes Creation of Agriculture Infrastructure Fund of Rs.1 lakh crore and Rs 500 crores for Bee-Keeping initiative.iii).	Since 24th March, 2020 under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, an amount of Rs.40000 crore has been transferred to the bank account of farmers.Contd…..2/-- 2 -iv).	Government facilitated the farmer for timely harvest of the entire crop, resulting in record procurement of Rabi crop production.v).	Several steps were taken to decongest wholesale market and to boost the supply chain like launching of FPO trade module under National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) platform and Kisan Rath mobile app. for facilitating availability of appropriate transport facility to the farmers for movement of farm produce.vi).	Starting of Kisan Rail to provide seamless connectivity among farmers, markets and consumers and help farmers send their perishable agro-products to inter-state markets in a time bound manner.vii).	Under the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA) States/UTs are offered to choose either Price Support Scheme (PSS) or Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) in a given procurement season with respect to particular oilseeds crop for the entire State. Pulses and Copra are procured under PSS. viii).	With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, a crop insurance scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was launched from Kharif 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover for all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances, with low premium contribution by farmers.	Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under its flagship program of National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) has screened large number of indigenous crop varieties including local germplasm and improved crop varieties of pulses (black gram, green gram, pigeonpea, chickpea) and cereals (rice, wheat, etc.) for major abiotic stresses like drought and heat to identify superior cultivars for cultivation on farmers’ fields.	Government of India is also implementing “Rainfed Area Development (RAD)” scheme as a component of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) to promote Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variability.  	Further, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has established Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) of Rs.3,000 crores (Rupees Three thousand crores only) every year. 	The Government of Andhra Pradesh has also brought out recently a new agriculture commodities procurement policy which aims at establishing permanent procurement centres for various commodities. The government has also created a new dedicated toll free number 1907 for redressing farmer’s grievances.  *****
