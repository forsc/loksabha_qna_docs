HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ????? (a) to (c):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT AS REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.493 ON 26/7/2019 REGARDING BRAIN DRAIN(a) & (b):   No significant brain drain which is to the extent of affecting the developments in Science and Technology (S&T) has been observed by the Union Government. Government has adopted three-pronged strategy to retain the best manpower in the country. First strategy has been the creation of substantial sophisticated research infrastructure and environment for scientific pursuits and academic / research institutions in the country. Secondly, opportunities have been created for overseas scientists of Indian origin to contribute to our country. Thirdly, new opportunities have been created for postdoctoral research in the country.(c)	Several measures have been taken by the Government to create new opportunities for scientists as well as for facilitating brain gain. The extramural funding schemes of Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Fellowship schemes of DST, DBT and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have been designed to encourage scientists to do quality research. Several schemes / programmes for building research infrastructure for enhancing research capabilities such as Fund for improvement of S&T infrastructures in universities and higher educational institutions (FIST) have been instituted. Other schemes like Core Research Grant, Research fellowships such as JC Bose and Swarnajayanti are targeted at scientific community to empower them to pursue world-class research in cutting edge areas of science and technology. Special attention has been given to young scientists for making them independent and motivate them to continue their research in the country. A large number of young scientists have been supported through schemes like Early Career Research Award, National Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). Significant new opportunities have been created by expansion of S&T led start-ups. Schemes like Atal Innovation Mission of Niti Aayog, National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) of DST and schemes of DBT are providing unprecedented opportunities for our scientists and technologists. The substantial increase of allocation (RE) of the Ministry of Science & Technology in the S&T sector from Rs. 33,413.2crore in the 2009-14 period to Rs. 51,423.1 crore during 2014-19 clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Government to develop the overall S&T landscape and encourages our scientists to continue their work in the country.The Flexible Complementing Scheme / Merit based promotion scheme positioned in scientific departments and the implementation of the VII Central Pay Commission pay scale and introduction of Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) in strategic Departments have also been instrumental in recruiting and retaining scientists. The amount of fellowship to research personnel (Junior / Senior Research Fellow, Research Associate) has been enhanced by 24-35% with effect from 1st January 2019 by the Central Government.DST through the Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Scheme, SERB through the Ramanujan Fellowship Scheme and DBT through Ramalingaswami re-entry Fellowship Scheme provide attractive avenues and opportunities to Indian researchers of high calibre, who are residing abroad, to work in Indian Institutes/Universities of their respective interest and domain. Wellcome Trust / DBT India Alliance Programme offers fellowship for any national for undertaking basic, clinical and public health research work in Indian Institutes/Universities etc. Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Scheme of SERB offers adjunct / visiting faculty positions to accomplished foreign scientists including scientists of Indian origin to undertake high quality research in Indian Institutions / Universities for specific period of time. All these measures taken by the Government are aimed at retaining and bringing Scientists and Technologists to India.                                                   ********
