This intervention is aimed at augmenting tribal household economy and administrative structure/institutional framework. III. SCHEME OF DEVELOPMENT OF PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TRIBAL GROUPS (PVTGS):-There are certain groups among Scheduled Tribes who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward. These groups are among the most vulnerable sections of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any signi?cant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and a  dministrative support.  75 such  groups in 18 States and one UT, i.e. UT of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, have been identi?ed and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).2.
