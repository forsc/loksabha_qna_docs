ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a): The farmers’ income estimates are made by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). Their last estimate was made for the agricultural year 2012-13. No new estimates are as yet available. However, the impact of various interventions/schemes, being implemented for the welfare of farmers indicate, that the strategy of doubling farmers’ income is in right direction. (b): There is no such income assessment report available that can estimate the impact of Coronavirus on the target of doubling farmers'' income.(c): There has been positive impact of (i) eNAM in terms of price realization & volumes traded; (ii) micro irrigation on crop productivity,  water conservation and higher resource use efficiency; (iii) soil health card & neem coated urea in achieving higher productivity & lower cost of production; (iv) NFSM in achieving higher productivity and production in case of cereals, pulses & oilseeds; (v) MIDH in achieving higher area coverage under horticulture, a high value crop; (vi) interest subvention scheme in increasing better access to institutional credit and so on. Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs) help in mobilisation of farmers and aggregation of produce, thereby helping farmers in achieving a more efficient input and output management.All these interventions are expected to increase the income of the farmers as per target. (d) to (f): National Statistical Office (NSO) is conducting a survey on Land and Livestock Holdings of Households and Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households for the year 2019-20. The survey collects details of the ownership and operational holdings of the rural households and situation assessment of agricultural households. This would enable the Government in assessing the extent of increase in farmers’ income.
