PRITAM GOPINATHRAO MUNDE REGARDING BONDED LABOUR.(a):	No, Sir.(b):	Does not arise(c):	The Government of India is fully committed to complete eradication of bonded labour and identify, rescue, release and rehabilitate them. The Bonded Laobur System has been abolished by Law throughout the country by an Ordinance with effect from 24.10.1975 and this Law was replaced by the Bonded Laobur System (Abolition) Act, 1976. The Act provides for the abolition of Bonded Laobur System with a view to prevent the economic and physical exploitation of the weaker sections of the people. Under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 identification, release and rehabilitation of freed bonded labour is the direct responsibility of the concerned States/Union Territories.(d):	Government’s efforts for eliminating bonded labour are facing some challenges which is mainly attributed to general social bias, absenteeism of bonded labourers as  witness due to their migratory nature and delay in trial of the bonded labour cases. (e):	  In order to assist the State Governments in the task of rehabilitation of identified and released bonded labour, Central Plan Scheme was started in 1978 and the Scheme has been revised from time to time.  The Scheme was last modified in May, 2016. A revised Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer-2016 is in operation since 17.05.2016.  As per the new Scheme, the Central Government bears 100% expenditure and the State Governments are not required to pay any matching contribution for the purpose of cash rehabilitation assistance, evaluatory studies, surveys and awareness campaigns against bonded labour. Under the Scheme, a bonded labour rehabilitation fund is created at the District level by each State with a permanent corpus of at least Rs.10 Lakh at the disposal of the District Magistrate. This fund is utilized for extending immediate financial help to the released bonded labour. Immediate financial assistance up to Rs.20,000/- per bonded labour is provided by the concerned District Magistrate from the corpus fund. This amount is fully reimbursed by the Central Government to the State Government. Further, under the Scheme financial Contd..3/-:: 3 ::assistance to the tune of Rs. 1.00 lakh, Rs. 2.00 lakh and Rs. 3.00 lakh are provided to released bonded labourers based on their category and level of exploitation as against an amount of Rs.20,000/- only in the earlier scheme. In addition to the financial assistance, the beneficiaries are also entitled for the following non-cash assistance from the respective State Governments:	1.	Allotment of House/site & agricultural land.		2.	Land development3.	Provision of low cost dwelling Units.4.	Animal husbandry, dairy, poultry, piggery etc.5. 	Wage employment, enforcement of minimum wages etc. 6.	Collection and processing of minor forest products.7.	Supply of essential commodities under targeted public distribution system.8.	Education for children.9. 	Any other Welfare Scheme of State/Central Govt.        As and when existence of bonded labour is detected, such persons are rescued, released and rehabilitated by District Administration. The total number of bonded labour identified and released is 3, 13,687 till date. *****
