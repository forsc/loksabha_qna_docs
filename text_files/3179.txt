                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)a) :	Government has put in place a liberal and transparent policy for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), wherein most of the sectors are open to FDI under the automatic route. The Government reviews the FDI policy on an ongoing basis and makes changes from time to time, to ensure that India remains a attractive & investor friendly destination.  (b) :	Salient features of the FDI Policy in defence, banking and food products are enclosed as Annexure I.(c) :	It has been the endeavour of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy. The intent is to make the FDI policy more investor friendly and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering investment inflows into the country. The extant FDI policy framework follows a negative list approach wherein barring a select few sectors, FDI is permitted up to100% in the automatic route, subject to applicable laws/regulations, security and other conditionalities. Detailed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy on various sectors indicating therein sector-wise FDI limits and sectoral conditions is provided in ‘Consolidated FDI Policy Circular of 2017’, as amended from time to time through subsequent Press Notes, which are available on the website of Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade at www.dipp.gov.in. (d)	Data on FDI received by small and medium size enterprises is not centrally maintained. (e)		State-wise details of total FDI is not centrally maintained. ********
