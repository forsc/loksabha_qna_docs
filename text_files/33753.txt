                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (Dr. JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	Yes Sir.(b)	The Government has accorded ‘In-Principle’ approval of the site at Jaitapur in Maharashtra for setting up of six nuclear power reactors of 1650 MW each in technical cooperation with France.  (c)	India is not a party to Vienna Convention (VC) on nuclear liability and hence the provisions of VC are not applicable / binding on any nuclear facility in India.(d)	Not applicable as per (c) above.(e)	Not applicable as per (c) above.(f)	India has ratified Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) in the year 2016. Any country which is party to Paris Convention / Vienna Convention or having a national legislation on nuclear liability which is aligned with Annex of CSC can join the same and ratify.
