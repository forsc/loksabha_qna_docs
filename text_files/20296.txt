Under this arrangement around Rs. 306 crores has been released during FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21.(d)	Projects across different sectors have been undertaken by the districts as per the extant rules of the state governments concerned. The sector-wise break-up of the sanctioned projects are mentioned below:Theme	No. of Projects sanctioned	Amount Disbursed (in Rs. crores)Health and Nutrition	125	104Education	82	78.3Agriculture & Water Resources	37	25Financial Inclusion & Skill Development	20	52.67Basic Infrastructure	16	45Others	13	0.97These projects are being monitored by the respective District Administration.
