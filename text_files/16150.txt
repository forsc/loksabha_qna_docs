Various programs/schemes are being implemented by different Ministries/departments of Central Government to bring down the unemployment amongst the youth. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) under the Ministry of Human Resource Development has informed that India Skill Report, 2019 by Wheebox, People Strong and CII states that 57% of the final year engineering graduates are employable which is marginal increase of 5% points since last year and the larger change of over 15% points in past 5 years.
