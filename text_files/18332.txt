MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) & (b):Ministry of Minority Affairs is implementing Nai Roshni scheme for Leadership Development of Minority Women across the country. The scheme aims to empower and instil confidence in women by providing knowledge, tools and techniques. Funds are not allocated/released State-wise but are released to Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) empanelled under Nai-Roshni scheme. The funds allocated under the scheme during the last two financial years is Rs. 30 crore out of which Rs. 38 lakh has been disbursed to PIA’s working in State of Andhra Pradesh.(c) & (d): The Evaluation study of Nai Roshni scheme was conducted by NITI Aayog in June 2016 and based on this study the scheme has been revised in year 2017. The findings of the study indicate that the programme has been appreciated by most segments of the society and it has assisted in creating confidence among minority women and developing leadership spirit in them. Moreover, the trained women are also utilizing their enriched knowledge within their surroundings and thereby helping their families as well as their neighbours in raising their rights and entitlements from various government authorities.*****
