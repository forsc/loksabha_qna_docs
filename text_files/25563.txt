                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a): In order to support those  transgender persons who lost their livelihoods during the pandemic times, financial assistance of Rs.1,500 was provided through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).  Whereas 6,940 persons were supported in 2020,  5,938 persons were supported in 2021. This initiative is only to support those who have completely lost their livelihoods, and not to every transgender person.(b): Ministry is not in possession of such information.(c): Ministry has launched National Portal for Transgender Persons (NPTP) on 25th November, 2020 (https://transgender.dosje.gov.in/). Through this portal, any Transgender applicant can obtain Certificate of Identity and Identity Card without any physical interface with the office of issue. The Transgender applicant can apply online for the Certificate of Identity from anywhere in the Country and application automatically goes to the inbox of the competent authority of issue. On issue of the certificate, the same can be downloaded by the applicant directly. So far, certificates of identity and ID cards have been issued to 1,804 Transgender applicants.*****
