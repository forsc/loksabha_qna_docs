ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (d): The Government has taken a number of steps, including strengthening of domestic manufacturing and promoting trade ties, with a number of trading partners, so as to ensure reliable and adequate supply chains. This is an ongoing process, based on the changing requirements in a dynamic world. The existing Trade Agreements also ensure seamless supplies for the domestic manufacturing sector on preferential terms. Further, a review of some of the existing Agreements has been initiated.In addition, bilateral trade negotiations with a number of countries have been initiated. We have entered into a Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) with Japan and Australia to enhance the resilience of supply chains in the Indo-Pacific Region. There has been substantial growth in India’s Merchandise exports in April-June 2021 which was USD 95.39 Billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 85.88 per cent over the same period last year and a positive growth of 17.90 per cent over April-June 2019, across commodity groups such as Engineering goods, Petroleum products, Gems & Jewellery, Organic & Inorganic Chemicals, Textile & Garments, Electronic goods, Plastic & Linoleum etc from across the country, including from Gujarat. *****
