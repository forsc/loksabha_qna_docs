ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a)  & (b) Sale of non-domestic LPG is purely a commercial activity and is not within the purview of the government. In addition to domestic LPG  distributors, based on market potential, Public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) appoint dedicated Non Domestic Non Exempted(NDNE) distributors for sale of non-domestic LPG.  OMCs have reported that they have been approached by some NDNE distributors with various demands which inter alia include :•	Allowing NDNE Retailers to market Domestic LPG.•	To stop regular LPG Distributors from selling Non Domestic LPG cylinders.•	Same incentive to all Distributors & NDNE Retailers irrespective of their sales volume.However, the above requests from NDNE distributors are not in line with the terms of their appointment as NDNE distributors are envisaged to sell only Non Domestic LPG cylinders. (c) 	OMCs have reported that commercial LPG business is a highly competitive business with the presence of private LPG marketers and the customer has option to choose any supplier. In certain markets, a dedicated distributor for commercial LPG business is necessary to focus on this segment and compete effectively.   (d) & (e) No such proposal is under consideration of the Government.
