ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c)  It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs), local bodies and industrial units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin and Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Further, priority for effective rejuvenation of small rivers has been accorded under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). No such proposal for conservation of river has been received from the Government of Himachal Pradesh under NRCP.           Himachal Pradesh has enacted the Groundwater Act in 2005 to regulate extraction of groundwater in the vulnerable areas of the State, which has now been extended all over the State. Further, Hydro-Electric Projects (HEPs) located on the catchment of rivers are mandated to ensure minimum 15% discharge of lean season flow on the downstream of the HEP into river body. Also, Real Time Water Quality Monitoring Stations (RTWQMS) with radar system for water quality and flow measurement have been set up to maintain environmental flow in the rivers/nallahs, including river Kaushalya near village Kamli, river Markanda in Ogli and Kala Amb town in Himachal Pradesh. Contd…P/2//2//		This Ministry launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) in 2015-16 with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. The Central Assistance under the schemes of Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) as well as RRR (Repair, renovation & restoration) of Water Bodies, which are components under PMKSY, is provided in the form of grant, which is 90% of the project cost in the 7 North Eastern States and hilly States/UTs (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and J&K, including Ladhak). Further, Central Assistance under both the schemes is 60% of project cost for projects in special areas that includes Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP) areas. 		6 clusters of 154 SMI schemes are ongoing in several districts of Himachal Pradesh, including Shimla, under PMKSY (Har Khet Ko Pani) with an estimated cost of Rs.499.26 crore and targeted irrigation potential of 0.25525 lakh-hectare. Central Assistance amounting to Rs.356.70 crore has been released for these schemes and 97 schemes have been reported to be completed with achievement of 0.18434 lakh-hectare irrigation potential up to March, 2021.		This Ministry has also launched a campaign “Catch the Rain”. Activities under this campaign include drives to make Rain Water Harvesting Structures (RWHS) like Rooftop RWHS, ponds, water harvesting pits, check dams, etc; enumeration and geo-tagging of all water bodies in the districts; removal of encroachments and de-silting of tanks to increase their storage capacity; removal of obstructions in the channels which bring water to them; repairs to step-wells and using defunct bore-wells to put the water back to aquifers; rejuvenation of rivulets  and rivers; conservation and restoration of wetlands, etc. A massive awareness generation campaign with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangthan (NYKS) has also been launched on 21st December, 2020 to cover all districts in the country.In addition, the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021, the World Water Day, with the theme – “Catch The Rain, Where it falls, When it falls”. JSA:CTR has been taken up in all districts (rural as well as urban areas) of the country during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country i.e. from March, 2021 to 30thNovember, 2021. No separate funds were allocated for JSA:CTR. However, under the above mentioned interventions, funds were utilized by convergence of different Central and State Government Schemes to achieve the goal of the campaign. As per available data as on 14th December 2021, Rs.22,352 crore has been spent from MGNREGA funds on works relating to water conservation and Rainwater Harvesting structures.*****
