ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d):  Lucknow-Pilibhit via Sitapur, Lakhimpur (262.76 Km) Gauge Conversion work was included in Budget 2011-12 and the latest anticipated cost of the project is `1077 crore.  The work has already been completed and commissioned from Aishbag to Lakhimpur (134.60 Km).  Work has been taken up in remaining section.  An expenditure of  `1047.92 crore has been incurred upto March 2019.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors affect the completion cost and time of the project.   Due to the above uncertain and variable parameters,  no confirmed time-frame can be given for completion of project at this stage.*****
