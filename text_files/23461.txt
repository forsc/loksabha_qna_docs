ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)&(b) The principal objective of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 is to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the household by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It provides livelihood security i.e. fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The households can register themselves under the Act and seek employment at multiple fora including the Gram Panchayats. The field authorities have been instructed to organise Rojgar Diwas at least once every month for covering willing unskilled labours. During FY 2020-21, more than 369 crore person-days have been generated as on 18.03.2021 which is approximately 40% more than the employment generated during the same period in FY 2019-20. During FY 2020-21, more than 1.77 crore new job cards have been issued so far which is 154% more than the total number of new job cards issued during FY 2019-20. During the current FY 2020-21, more than 10.98 Crore persons were provided employment so far which is 39% more than the persons provided employment during FY 2019-20 under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.The Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act requires that priority be given to women in such a way that at least one-third of the beneficiaries be women. Mahatma Gandhi NREG Scheme is a gender neutral programme which promotes participation of women by providing wage parity with men, provision of separate schedule of rates of wages for women, facilities for crèche, work-side sheds for children, and child care services. In convergence with NRLM, women mates have also been introduced, which again facilitate the participation of women. The Scheme also endeavours to provide works near the residence of the beneficiaries. These measures have enhanced participation of women,   which is more than 50 %, far ahead of the minimum percentage of 33% as mandated by the Act. The percentage of participation of women under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS from FY 2016-17 to FY 2020-21 is given below: Financial Year	   2020-21             2019-20	    2018-19	 2017-18	 2016-17                (as on 20.03.2021)	Percentage of participation of women	   53.07 %	       54.78 %	      54.59%	  53.53%	  56.16 %(c) The responsibility of implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is vested with the Governments of States /UTs. The Ministry has a comprehensive system of monitoring and review mechanism for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. The Ministry regularly reviews the performance of the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in States/UTs through various media viz., Mid-Term Review, Labour Budget meetings, Labour Budget Revision meetings, programme review meetings. Central Employment Guarantee Council and State Employment Guarantee Councils periodically monitor implementation of the programme.  National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions and Officers of the Ministry visit States/UTs at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States/UTs for appropriate action at their end. Auditing Standards have been issued and States have been advised to establish independent Social Audit Units, conduct Social Audit as per Audit of Scheme Rules and training of Village resource persons for conducting Social Audit etc. Internal Audit Teams of the Department also conduct regular audit. All grievances/ complaints received in the Ministry are forwarded to the concerned States/UTs for taking appropriate action including investigation, as per law. Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and appointment of Ombudsperson in every district of States/UTs. State specific reviews of States/UTs are also undertaken from time to time. Consistent efforts of the Government has resulted in better implementation of MGNREGS in terms of generation of persondays of employment, creation of durable assets, duly geotagged,  enhanced budgetary allocation, employment to more workers, timely payment to workers etc.******
