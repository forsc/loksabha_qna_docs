MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a)  As per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+), 2018-19 (provisional), details of State/UT-wise number of Government schools in the country, including Bihar, with drinking water and toilets are at Annexure. (b) to (e) Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution and most of the schools are under jurisdiction of concerned States & UTs. States and UTs have been repeatedly advised to ensure that all the schools, including those under the non-Government sector (private, aided schools, etc.) in their jurisdiction should have provision for separate toilets for boys and girls; and safe and adequate drinking water facilities for all children.The Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha w.e.f. 2018-19, which subsumes the three erstwhile Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). Under Samagra Shiksha, States and UTs are supported for strengthening of existing Government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities including drinking water and toilets as per proposals received from respective State/UT. The scheme also provides for an annual recurring composite school grant varying upto Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum depending upon the number of students, for all government schools, out of which at least 10% is to be spend on activities related to Swachhata Action Plan for hygiene and sanitation.Every year, Annual Work Plan & Budget (AWP&B) under Samagra Shiksha is prepared by the respective States and UTs based on their requirements and priorities for various interventions including strengthening of the school infrastructure. These plans/estimates are appraised and approved by the Project Approval Board in Ministry of Education as per the programmatic and financial norms of the scheme, availability of budgetary resources and physical & financial progress, in consultation with the respective States/UTs.Under erstwhile SSA till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, provision of 2.50 lakh drinking water facilities, construction of 4.12 lakh Boys’ toilets, 5.31 lakh separate girls’ toilets and 1.54 lakh toilets for Children with Special Needs (CwSN) have been sanctioned to States and UTs for elementary schools. Out of which, States and UTs have reported provision of 2.36 lakh drinking water facilities, construction of 3.86 lakh Boys’ toilets, 5.17 lakh separate girls’ toilets and  1.29 lakh toilets for CwSN, till 31.01.2021.Under erstwhile RMSA till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha from 2018-19, provision of 12,388 drinking water facilities, 34207 Boys’ toilets, 36302 Girls’ toilets’ and 1,878 toilets for Children with Special Needs (CwSN) have been sanctioned for secondary schools to States and UTs. Out of which, States and UTs have reported provision of 10584 drinking water facility, construction of 26944 Boys’ toilets, 27042 separate girls’ toilets and 193 toilets for CwSN, till 31.01.2021.* * *
