                                                        (a)	and (b):	There is no such proposal with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Government is committed to freedom of speech and expression and privacy of its citizens as enshrined in the constitution of India.  (c):	Section 43A and section 72A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for privacy and security of data in digital form. Section 43A of the Act provides for compensation to be paid to the affected users in case of unauthorized access of information and leakage of sensitive personal information respectively. It mandates ‘body corporate’ to implement ‘reasonable security practices’ for protecting ‘sensitive personal information’ of individuals. Section 72A of the Act provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment upto 3 years and fine for disclosure of information in breach of the lawful contract. To further strengthen privacy and personal data protection of citizens, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) on 31st  July 2017 constituted a Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B N Srikrishna, Former Judge, Supreme Court of India, to look into all aspects relating to personal data protection. The committee gave its report on 27th July, 2018. The Committee also submitted a draft Personal Data Protection Bill. Wide consultations were held on the draft Bill and open feedback was invited on the contents of the Bill. These are currently being processed and it is proposed to table the Bill in Parliament.********
