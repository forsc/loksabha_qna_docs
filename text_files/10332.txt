ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (d) 	Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has been incurring losses since 2009-10. BSNL does not fulfil the criteria under affordability clause as per Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines dated 03.08.2017 on pay revision in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) w.e.f. 01.01.2017.  Therefore, the pay revision in BSNL has not been considered due to poor financial condition and continuous losses in BSNL.************
