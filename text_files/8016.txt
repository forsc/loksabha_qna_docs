ANSWER




                                                        (a)    Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has the mandate for regulation and development of inland waterways for the purposes of shipping and navigation and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto as per IWAI Act, 1985.   For development of  shipping  and navigation and to promote inland water transport in the country as an economical, environment friendly supplementary mode of transport to rail and road, 111 inland waterways (including 5 National Waterways declared earlier) were declared as ‘National Waterways’ under the National Waterways Act, 2016.  The details of projects initiated on these National Waterways are as under:  National Waterway (NW)-1 (Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia), NW-2 (River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya), NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have been developed with fairway navigational aids, jetties and terminals with mechanized equipment handling facilities for loading and unloading of cargo. These NWs are operational and vessels are plying on them.  In addition, NW-10 (River Amba), NW-68 (River Mandovi), NW-73 (River Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek-Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river–Jaigad creek system), NW-97 (Sunderbans Waterways), NW-100 (River Tapi) and NW-111 (River Zuari) are also operational. The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369.18 crore for capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia–Varanasi stretch of NW-1 with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.  Projects worth Rs. 1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances. Fairway development works on the Vijayawada–Muktyala stretch of river Krishna (Part of NW-4) has commenced at a cost of Rs. 96 crore. Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) prepared for 106 new NWs, technical interventions have been planned for safe navigation and shipping on technically viable NWs by the IWAI.   As per the DPRs completed so far for the new NWs, 36 NWs have been found to be technically viable and development activities have been initiated on 10 NWs viz. NW-9, NW-16, NW-27, NW-37, NW-40, NW-58, NW-68, NW-86, NW-97 and NW-111. (b) & (c)    No National Waterway in North Bengal has been found feasible for transportation of goods, and, therefore, there is no plan in this regard.                                          *****
