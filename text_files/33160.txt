                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b): Continuing with the proactive and graded risk based approach, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has periodically revised and updated ‘Guidelines for International arrivals’. As per the current travel advisory (updated on 20th January 2022), all travelers from all countries are required to submit a pre-departure negative COVID-19 test report and a self-declaration form detailing their travel history. In addition, travelers from countries deemed ‘at-risk’ based on the COVID-19 situation in these countries are required to undergo testing on arrival at the airport. List of such ‘at-risk’ regions/countries is dynamic and has been updated from time to time. In addition, a fraction of travelers (2%) from ‘non at-risk’ countries too are also tested on arrival in India.As per the guidelines, all international travelers are required to undergo mandatory home quarantine for 7 days and are required to undergo re-testing again on 8th Day of their arrival in India and are required to upload their test result on the Air Suvidha Portal for follow up by the concerned State Health Authorities.***
