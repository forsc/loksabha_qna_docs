ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship presently is not implementing any skill vouchers/skill wallets scheme. (b)      The Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 which is a grant based scheme. Incentive structure is built into the scheme, the incentive being dependent on the number of trained persons getting actually employed or self employed after training. (c)        Under the PMKVY scheme, so far Rs. 6221.39 Cr. has been released to National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and States/UTs. In addition to PMKVY, the Ministry of Skill Development also runs other skill development schemes such as Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), creation/improvement of long term training infrastructure of Industrial Training Institutes (ITI), etc. In addition, 20 other Central Ministries / Departments are also implementing more than 40 other skill development programmes. (d) and (e)      In view of (a), question does not arise.
