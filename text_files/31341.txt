                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) 	The number of houses sanctioned/allocated and its completion status under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) during the last three years i.e. from Financial Year 2018-19 to 2020-21 in the country including Prayagraj district of Uttar Pradesh and Banswara and Dungarpur of Rajasthan along with the details of Central Share released to the States is given at Annexure-I. (b) 	The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented w.e.f. 1st April, 2016 in rural areas across the country. Under PMAY-G, a total of 1,66,04,079 houses have been constructed in the country, including 22,68,068 & 12,17,543 houses in the States of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan respectively as on 09.12.2021. The State-wise details of number of houses likely to be constructed up to the financial year 2021-22 is given at Annexure-II. (c) 	The State-wise details of total number of houses sanctioned to beneficiaries and houses completed under PMAY-G during the last three years i.e. from Financial Year 2018-19 to 2020-21 is given in reply to para (a) above at Annexure-I. (d) Under PMAY-G, the funds are transferred to the beneficiary directly into his/ her bank account, and the house is constructed by the beneficiary himself/herself or under his/her supervision. Since there is no provision of construction of PMAY-G houses by contractors, therefore, the issue of blacklisting of contractors does not arise. (e) & (f) Under PMAY-G, a total target of 2.63 crore houses have been allocated to the States/UTs, out of which 2.13 crore houses have been sanctioned, first installment of funds has been released to 2.01 crore beneficiaries and 1.66 crore houses have been completed as on 09.12.2021. During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected which retarded the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses. Besides, the delays are also due to delay in release of Central & State Share from State Treasury to State Nodal Account of PMAY-G, cases of unwillingness of beneficiaries, migration, disputed succession of deceased beneficiaries, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs and at times General/Assembly/Panchayat elections, unavailability of building materials. The Ministry is taking the following initiatives to ensure timely completion of the houses under PMAY-G:i.	Regular review of progress at the level of Ministry to ensure timely completion of targeted houses. ii.	The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G with specific focus and priority of houses for which 2nd and 3rd instalments have been released. iii.	Daily monitoring on various parameters like Gaps in sanction of houses, cleaning of PWL of PMAY-G and release of Central Share/State Matching Share from treasury to SNA.iv.	Timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs and release of adequate funds at the level of the Ministry.v.	Promotion of eco-friendly & innovative technologies for house construction. vi.	Regular follow ups with the State to ensure release of central and state share of funds and provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas.vii.	Expeditious resolution of technical issues and other constraints faced by the States.viii.	Steps are being taken to increase the coverage of Rural Mason Training (RMT) programme which would increase the availability of trained masons leading to faster construction of quality houses.ix.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs, Districts based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/UTs for achieving the set targets.******
