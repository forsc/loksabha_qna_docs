                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCESH. PANKAJ CHOUDHARY(a) : Article 279 A (5) of the Constitution prescribes that the Goods and Service Tax Council shall recommend the date on which the goods and services tax be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel (ATF). Also, as per the Section 9(2) of the CGST Act, inclusion of these products in GST will require recommendation of the GST Council. So far, the GST Council, in which the states are also represented, has not made any recommendation for inclusion of these goods under GST.(b): Certain representations have been received to bring petrol and diesel under GST. (c): 44th Meeting of GST Council was held on 12thJune 2021.(d), (e) and (f):  The Council may consider the issue of inclusion of petrol and diesel at a time it considers appropriate keeping in view all the relevant factors including revenue implication. No such proposal to bring petrol and diesel under GST has been discussed in GST Council. As regards LPG, the same is already under GST.(g): To provide relief to the consumers, customs duty has been reduced on crude palm oil from 35.75% to 30.25% and on refined palm oil from 49.5% to 41.25% w.e.f. 30th June, 2021. The reduced rate shall be applicable till 30th September, 2021. Further, the import policy of Refined Palm Oils has been amended from “restricted “ to the “free” category for a period upto 31.12.2021.******
