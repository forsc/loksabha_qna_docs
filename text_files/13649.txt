ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)   Erosion and deposition of silt is a natural process in alluvial rivers. Rivers carry, pickup and drop silt load as per their regime conditions i.e. discharge in the river, river slope, morphology, nature of silt etc. The measures for flood management including desilting of rivers are formulated and implemented by the State Government as per their priority. Government of India supplements the efforts of State Government by providing technical advise and promotional financial assistance for critical areas. The matter regarding desiltation of Ganga river has been studied by various Committees. The broad finding are that desilting of rivers for flood control is not an economically viable solution. Rather, indiscriminate desilting would cause adverse impacts on river ecology. Instead, selective dredging based on scientific studies has been recommended. (c) As informed by Government of West Bengal, the land lost due to flood, in river Ganga in the Murshidabad District of West Bengal during the period January-2005 to December-2018 was 730 Hectares.(d) & (e)  The State Government undertakes relief measures in the wake of natural disasters from State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) placed at their disposal in accordance with approved norms of Government of India. Additional assistance is provided from National Disaster Response Funds (NDRF) as per established procedure. Providing relief assistance and its distribution to farmers is the responsibility of State Government from the SDRF.  *****
