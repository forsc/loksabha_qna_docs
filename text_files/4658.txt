ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)  Under the National Waterways Act, 2016, National Waterway (NW)-9 is the Alappuzha – Kottayam – Athirampuzha Canal stretching from Boat-Jetty, Alappuzha to Athirampuzha Market via Kottayam and NW-59 is the Kottayam–Vaikom Canal stretching from Kottayam near Kodimatha to Vechoor joining NW-3 (near Kumarakom). Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has taken up development of Alappuzha – Kottayam – Athirampuzha Canal of NW-9 at an estimated cost of Rs.1.60 crore.  Night navigation facilities have been installed between Alappuzha to Kottayam (Kodimatha) and this waterway is operational for ferry services.   In view of the findings of the Detailed Project Report (DPR), development of NW-59 is not envisaged at present.                                        *****
