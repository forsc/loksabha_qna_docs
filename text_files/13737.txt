ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		Underground cable systems of 220 kV and upto 400 kV voltage level are part of Indian Transmission Infrastructure. However, due to techno-economic reasons like higher reactive compensation requirement and higher cost compared to overhead system, underground cables are  being used on case by case basis for short distances, where laying of overhead transmission lines is difficult particularly in urban areas and underground generation stations. Underground Cable systems of 220 kV and upto 400 kV, wherever they have been laid, are therefore, an integral part of the Modern Day Power Transmission Infrastructure.(b) to (d) :	Underground cable systems have been implemented by Central and State Utilities in various parts of the country. Based on information available, the details of such cable system implemented / under implementation in transmission system of the country is given at Annexure.**************
