                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS  (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) & (b): Government has no plan to make provision to give small lease to farmers in their holdings by bringing in a new mining policy. Rule 12(5) of Mineral (Other than Atomic and Hydro Carbons Energy Minerals) Concession Rules, 2016, the minimum area for grant of mining lease shall not be less than five hectares. In respect of major minerals, mining leases above 5 hectares can be granted either through auction or reservation for public sector undertakings. In respect of minor minerals, respective States are required to frame rules for grant of mining concessions. State Governments have been advised to follow transparent and non-discretionary procedure in grant of mineral concessions. (c) & (d): The National Mineral Policy 2019 formulated by the Ministry of Mines proposes to increase the production of major minerals and reduce trade deficit in mineral sector. Further, to promote the mining industry, the Policy 2019 aims to attract private investment through various measures.*****
