ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs), is regularly monitoring the water quality of rivers & other water bodies in the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP). As per CPCB report of September, 2018, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels, an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure.(c) & (d)  Water Aid India has informed that it has neither undertaken any assessment of pollution levels in surface water in India, nor has it made any remarks regarding pollution level of surface water in India in the recent past.(e) & (f)   Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is a continuous process and Central Government is supplementing  the  efforts of  the State Governments and Union Territories in addressing the challenges of Contd…P/2//2//pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and Namami Gange. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5965.90 crore & sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 335 projects has been sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 29,578 crore so far, of which 142 projects have been completed and made operational. Out of 335 projects, 156 projects are in the sewerage sector for creation of total sewage treatment capacity of 4867 mld, and sewerage network of 5066 kms.            In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.            As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into rivers and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, SPCBs and PCCs regularly monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal in OA No.673/2018, States and UTs are implementing Action Plans for restoration of water quality in the identified polluted stretches of rivers in their respective States. River Rejuvenation Committees have been constituted by State Governments/Union Territories for preparation and implementation of approved Action Plans and a Central Monitoring Committee has been constituted at Central level to monitor progress of implementation.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3859 to be answered on the 18.03.2021 regarding “Pollution Level of Surface Water”.State / UTs Wise Polluted River Stretches of Surface WaterS.No.	Name Of State	Name Of Polluted River Stretches	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi, Kamalpur, PanchnaiBrahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, BordoibamBeelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, TengaPukhuri	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damanganga	16	Delhi	Yamuna,	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, BalehwarKhadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana, Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, ChuntKol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, AsangiNalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala	21   15	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal, Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga	2216	Maharashtra	Godavari, Kalu, Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula, Mutha, Nira, Vel, Bhima, Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti	53Contd…P/217	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah, Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano	621	Odisha	Gangua, GuradihNallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, BanguruNallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal,	225	Sikkim	ManeyKhola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga, ThirumanimUthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta	17Grand Total :	351*****
