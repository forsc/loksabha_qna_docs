                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e):   Health is a State subject.  It is for the respective State Government to take any action against the private hospitals for charging exorbitantly from patients or for any insensitive behavior towards them.

National Council for Clinical Establishments has approved a standard list of medical procedures and standard template for costing which has been shared with all State and UTs, where the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010, is applicable, to work out the cost of various procedures and services provided by the clinical establishments taking into the account all factors including local factors.As on date, the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010 has been adopted by 11 States namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana; and 7 UTs namely, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. The implementation of the Act is within the remit of respective State/UT Government.*****
