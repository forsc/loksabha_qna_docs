ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	& (b):	RCEP was intended to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for RCEP countries. But the structure of RCEP did not adequately address the ambitions and concerns of India’s stakeholders. In light of these, India decided not to join the RCEP, in its current form and during the 3rd RCEP Leaders’ Summit held on 4th November, 2019 in Bangkok, India conveyed its position that current structure of RCEP did not reflect the RCEP Guiding Principles or address the outstanding issues and concerns of India. (c):	Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) conducts trade remedies related investigations under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and the Rules made thereunder on the basis of a duly substantiated application filed by the domestic industry alleging dumping of goods including Chinese goods into the country causing injury to the domestic industry. The basic intent of such investigations is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry and create a level playing field of open and fair competition in the Indian market.(d):	Government has taken a number of steps to create and strengthen dairy infrastructure for procurement, processing and marketing of milk and milk products. These include financial assistance by setting up Animal Husbandry infrastructure, Development Fund, Quality and Marketing promotion, providing soft loans including interest subvention on working capital loans for the dairy sector to enable cooperative societies and farmer producer organizations engaged in dairy activities.*****
