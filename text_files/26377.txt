ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a): Several provisions have been made in the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) to improve the standard of education in school and higher education. NEP 2020 provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. NEP 2020 aims to ensure that no student loses any opportunity to learn and excel because of the circumstances of birth or background. It proposes special emphasis to be given on Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs). The NEP 2020 reaffirms that bridging the social category gaps in access, participation, and learning outcomes in both school and higher education will continue to be one of the major goals of all education sector development programmes.(b) to (e): Improving the quality of education across all levels from primary to university level is a continuous and ongoing process. National Education Policy, 2020 focuses on improving the quality of education through various measures such as introduction of new pedagogical and curricular structure, Early Childhood Care and Education, Foundational Literacy and Numeracy and Transforming Assessment for Student Development, Experiential and Competency basedLearning, etc. Major schemes/projects/programmes have been aligned with NEP 2020. Besides, Ministry is implementing various schemes/programmes such as Samagra Shiksha, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT), Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM) etc. to raise the standard of education in the country including aspirational districts and rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Since Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution of India, State/UT Governments play a vital role in the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020.*******
