ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) are already in place for 33 States and Union Territories of the country. SAPCC is a policy document wherein States and Union Territories have indicated their sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions for combating climate change. Recently, the Ministry has requested the States/UTs to initiate the process of revision of SAPCCs to achieve coherence between the post 2020 climate actions at national and sub-national level. (c) and (d) The Government has taken several steps to address air pollution, water pollution and land pollution, whichincludes, inter-alia, notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time, setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality, introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), launching of National Air Quality Index, leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards, notification of waste management rulescovering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, construction & demolition waste and hazardous wastes, banning biomass burning, streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate, issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution, installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries, notification of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and NCR, Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR, formulation of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), organization of clean air campaigns, etc.The other steps include, inter-alia, implementation of National Action Plan on Climate Change along with its eight missions; National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change; National Afforestation Programme; Compensatory Afforestation Fund; Namami Gange Programme; Jal Shakti Abhiyan; Swachh Bharat Mission, etc. As a result, there has been an overall improvement in air quality of Delhi with number of ‘Good’ to ‘Moderate’ days increasing to 182 in 2019, as compared to 108 in 2016. With reference to PM10 and PM2.5, 18 and 12 cities respectively, have showed a decreasing trend. As per ambient air quality data (2014-2018), most of the cities across the country have been found complying to National Standards with respect to parameters for SO2 and NO2. India is one of the few countries where forest and tree cover has increased. India has achieved 21% reduction in emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2005 and 2014, thereby achieving its pre-2020 voluntary goals of reducing emission intensity of its GDP by 20 to 25% from 2005 levels. * * * * *
