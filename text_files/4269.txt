Any increase in cost of coking coal adversely affects the cost of steel production. (d)-(e): In order to meet the demand of coking coal for steel sector, Coal India Limited (CIL) has taken initiatives to acquire coking coal assets abroad, with particular focus in Australia and Canada, with a view to import the produces to India and enhance raw material security of the country. Certain assets have been identified. The acquisition process will entail conducting detailed due diligence and closure of the commercial deal. The time required for such process is asset specific and therefore it is not possible to indicate any specific time period by which such deal can be closed. No specific amount of fund has been earmarked for the said purpose but the same will be arranged once the investment proposal for any specific asset has been finalized. (f): In order to increase the availability of coking coal, following are the steps taken by the coal companies:I.
