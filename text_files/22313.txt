                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) to (d): The Ministry of Food Processing industries (MoFPI) does not setup any food processing industries/ units/projects on its own. However, it is implementing a Central Sector umbrella scheme- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) for overall growth and development of food processing sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 Crore for the period 2016-17 to 2019-20. The period has since been extended to FY 2020-21. Under component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries. PMKSY is not any region or state specific but demand driven and is implemented across the country including in the state of Odisha.   The details of projects approved in Odisha under the component schemes of PMKSY are enclosed at Annexure. As part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Initiative, MoFPI is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme-PM Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PMFME) for providing financial, technical and business support for setting up/upgradation of 2 lakh micro food processing enterprises through credit linked subsidy during five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with an outlay of Rs.10,000 cr.  Out of this, a total of 4709 units have been allocated to Odisha with outlay of Rs 215.58 Crores for next five years. *****
