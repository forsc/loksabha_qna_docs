                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) According to the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019 prepared by Forest Survey of India, the estimated carbon in the Country’s forest and tree cover in 2015 was 29.62 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. As per ISFR-2019, India’s total forest cover in 2019 is 7,12,249sq. km. and total tree cover is 95,027 sq. km. Together, thisconstitutes 24.56% of the geographic area of the country. Since 2015-16 to 2019-20, annual afforestation on an average of 1.6 million hectares has been achieved collectively by all agencies in States/UTs through various afforestation and tree planting programmes. Achievements of afforestation/ tree planting for the year 2015-16 to 2019-20 is at Annexure.(c) to (f) Government of India has taken several initiatives towards creating a carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. Financial assistance to States/UTs under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes including, inter alia, National Afforestation Programme, Development of Wildlife Habitat, Project Elephant, Project Tiger and Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme are supporting such efforts. Further, afforestation is a major activity under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund. These initiatives also help in conservation of very dense forest and moderately dense forest as well as increase in forest and tree cover.Government of India is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising of eight Missions, which provides an overarching policy framework for all climate actions in the country. Under NAPCC, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to climate change by means of plantation activities in forest and non-forest areas. Started in 2015-16, a sum of Rs. 455.73 crores have been released to fourteen States and one Union Territory for undertaking afforestation activities over an area of 1,67,151 hectares including restoration of Wetlands which will contribute to achieve the NDC target. India has also committed to achieve land degradation neutrality and restoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. This will help in preserving forests and biodiversity, facilitating conservation of natural resources and improving carbon sinks. MoEF&CC is currently implementing a centrally sponsored scheme ‘National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic ecosystems (NPCA)’ for Conservation and Management of Wetlands NPCA aims at holistic conservation and restoration of wetlands including lakes for achieving the desired water quality enhancement and improvement in biodiversity and ecosystems.Further, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is also implementing the National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) since 2014. The XV Finance Commission has assigned 10% weight to forest and ecology in its horizontal devolution criteria and weights. ***
