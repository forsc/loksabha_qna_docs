ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) No Sir. The Right to Education Act, 2009 provides for free and compulsory elementaryeducation for every child in the age group of 6 to 14 years beginning at primary level.(b) Question does not arise.(c) No Sir.(d) Section 11 of RTE Act, 2009 states that- “With a view to prepare children above the ageof three years for elementary education and to provide early childhood care and education forall children until they complete the age of six years, the appropriate Government may makenecessary arrangements for pre-school education for such children.’’ AppropriateGovernments include States and UTs as Education is a concurrent subject. Research andexperience have repeatedly demonstrated that Early Childhood Development and Educationnot only increases the progress and achievement of children in primary schools and lay thefoundation for future growth, learning and development, but also develop positive attitudesand the desire to learn. Therefore, it becomes imperative to provide quality pre-schoolexperiences to children. Under Samagra Shiksha, preschool programme is of up to 2 yearsduration that is for children of the age group 4-6 years which prepares the children for formalschool education that begins at primary level.*****
