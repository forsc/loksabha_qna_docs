ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) & (b) The year-wise targets and achievements made in terms of renewable energy capacity addition during last five years in the country is as follows:                                                      (in MW)Year	Target 	Achievement 2014-15	3770	40312015-16	4460	70242016-17	16660	113212017-18	14550	118862018-19	15600	8532(c) The target during last three years were not fully achieved due to following reasons:i.	Major challenges in  meeting the utility scale solar power targets are delay in land acquisition and power evacuation infrastructure.  ii.	During the implementation of phase I of the Rooftop Solar programme the slow progress of rooftop solar installations was primarily due to multiple approval process, lack of uniform regulations, apprehension of Discoms to loss revenue, public awareness, etc. iii.	The less capacity addition under wind power is due to the transition of wind power sector from feed-in-tariff regime to transparent competitive bidding mechanism and issues relating to land acquisition in certain states. iv.	Delay in statuary clearances by the State Government bodies.(d) A total of 11800 MW renewable energy capacity has been targeted to be installed through renewable energy sources in the country.(e) and (f)  Keeping in view of the previous years’ experience and also the constraints being faced by the project developers, a modest current financial year target has been set based on the bids completed and number of RE projects that are expected to be installed in the country. *****
