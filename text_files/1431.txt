                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): 	Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility for the implementation of various health schemes in the country including Punjab and Chandigarh lies with the State Governments. Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their health care systems, based on the proposals received by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plan (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. As such, Government of India under NHM does not provide any financial assistance to Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) directly, for the implementation of various health schemes.However, under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), as per information received from UT Government of Chandigarh, no financial assistance is given to NGOs in Chandigarh. Further, under RNTCP, as per information received from Government of Punjab, NGO wise financial assistance during the last three years is attached at Annexure. Further, under National AIDS Control Program (NACP), financial assistance is provided to State AIDS Control Societies for running Targeted Intervention (TI) projects through NGOs to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS among highly vulnerable populations.Under NACP, funds allocated in Lakhs in the Annual Action Plan during last three years is as follows:State	FY 2017-18	FY 2018-19	FY 2019-20Punjab	1327.06	1494.12	1606.93 Chandigarh	220.30	225.36	267.70(c) & (d):	 Under NACP, All NGOs need to mandatorily register in Darpan portal of NITI Aayog to be eligible for financial aid. State AIDS Control Society (SACS) and Technical support Unit (TSU) set up by National AIDS control organization regularly monitor the programmatic aspects of NGOs contracted under NACP. Regular Internal Audits are also conducted to monitor the financial aspects. Additionally, third party evaluation of the NGOs running TI projects are conducted every two years. Continuation of NGOs concerned depends on the report of third-party evaluator certifying their performance and integrity. In case irregularities are found, the activities of the NGOs are suspended or they are discontinued. Under RNTCP, the monitoring of the functioning/irregularities of NGOs involved in RNTCP, lies with respective State Government.
