To consolidate, manage and protect forest, various measures are taken by State Forest Departments, such as survey and demarcation of forest areas, construction of boundary pillars, check posts, use of modern technology (that includes wireless network, remote sensing, Geographical Information System, Global Positioning System), improved mobility to the field staff by providing vehicles for patrolling, etc. Local communities are also encouraged and involved in conservation, protection and management of forests through Joint Forest Management Committees/Village Level Committees. Further, Government of India has taken the following steps for growth and progress of Forest Based Industries:-(i) The Ministry has issued Wood Based Industries (Establishment and Regulation) Guidelines, 2016 and amendment dated 11th September 2017 to decentralize the regulatory processes concerning the wood based industries for the development of the sector in the country.(ii) The Ministry has issued suggestive guidelines for relaxation in felling and transit regulation for tree species grown on non-forest private land to create a conducive environment for encouraging farmers/land owners to take up agroforestry/ tree plantation.  (iii)	Various schemes are being implemented by the Central and State Government/Union Territory Administration for increase in forest and tree cover in the country. These include the National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM) being implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Compensatory Afforestation Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). Afforestation activities are also taken up under various schemes of State Government /UT Administration.  (iv) National Mission for a Green India (GIM) is one of the ongoing Missions outlined under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. It aims at protecting, restoring, and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to Climate Change through plantation activities in the forest and non-forest areas. GIM activities were started in Financial Year 2015-16. The activities under GIM are being implemented by Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at the village level.  (v) For the development of forest based industries in particular wood panel industries and people working therein, the institutes under the Ministry viz. Indian Plywood Industries Research and Training Institute and Institute of Wood Science and Technology provides technical assistance and guidance in consultancy/sponsored project mode for setting up plywood, particle board and Medium Density Fiber (MDF) board manufacturing industries based on plantation grown timbers.
