                                                        (a) to (e)	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 is enabling large number of prospective youth for taking up Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through empanelled training centers / training providers (TCs/TPs) throughout the country. Under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 11.11.2019, 69.03 lakh (appx.) (38.01 lakh STT + 31.02 lakh RPL) candidates have been trained throughout the country.Under PMKVY 2016-20, focus on employment has been significantly enhanced and candidates have been placed in various sectors and industries. Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. The scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. The reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate. Under STT, as per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), 30.21 lakh candidates are certified. Out of these certified candidates, 15.4 lakh candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors across the country which is approximately 51% of certified candidates.The State-wise candidates enrolled, trained, assessed, certified and reported placed under PMKVY 2016-20, as on 11.11.2019, is given at Annexure.
