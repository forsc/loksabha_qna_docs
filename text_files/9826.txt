ANSWER




                                                        Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to 1 crore prospective youth under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020 with an outlay of Rs. 12,000 Cr. PMKVY (2016-20) has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, 25% of the funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of the scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC), Government of Rajasthan, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 64,526 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 94.62 Cr. for FY 2016-20; out of which, Rs. 14.19 Cr. has been already disbursed to State of Rajasthan for the implementation of this component in the State. However, due to slow performance and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalized to Rs. 70.96 crore.
