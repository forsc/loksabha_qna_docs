Minor Forest Produces worth approximately Rs. 6.10 lakh and Rs. 2.92 lakh have been procured in the Udaipur and Sirohi Districts respectively during 2020-21.   (d)       The list of Minor Forest Produces for which Minimum Support price has been fixed by Ministry of Tribal Affairs is at Annexure. (e)        The Ministry of Tribal Affairs under its schemes namely ‘Institutional Support for development and marketing of tribal products/produce’ and ‘Marketing Of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) Through Minimum Support Price (MSP) And Development Of Value Chain For MFP’ provides grant-in-aid to State Governments for enhancement of infrastructure facilities to improve the supply chain of MFPs in the States. These are demand-driven schemes and funds are released to States on the basis of proposals received from them. The Ministry has released an amount of Rs. 5.63 crores to Rajasthan during 2019-20 under Institutional Support scheme for market intervention and supply chain infrastructure development of MFPs. Apart from the above, the Ministry implements Van Dhan Vikas Karyakaram under the Scheme ‘Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP’ which targets livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. Under this programme, community owned Minor Forest Produce centric multi-purpose Kendras are set-up in predominantly tribal districts which act as common facility centres for procurement cum value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. TRIFED under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal implementing agency for Van Dhan Vikas Karyakaram and provides marketing support to MFP gatherers.
