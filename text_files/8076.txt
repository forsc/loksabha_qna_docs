ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Construction of new airport does not come under the purview of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). However, any airport which is included in the awarded routes of UDAN, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. 43 underserved and unserved airports have been operationalized under this scheme, details of which are attached at Annexure-A.;(b): Jogbani airstrip in Araria district belongs to Airports Authority of India having total land area of 153.5 acres. The airstrip figures in the list of unserved airstrips/airports in the scheme document of RCS-UDAN. No bid was received under three rounds of bidding under the scheme for this airstrip. However, if any bid is received in future, the same will be considered as per the provisions of the scheme document.;(c): Government has launched RCS-UDAN on 21.10.2016 to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS - UDAN is market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces and airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes. The scheme is valid for a period of 10 years. The Implementing Agency conducts the bidding from time to time during the currency of the scheme. ;
