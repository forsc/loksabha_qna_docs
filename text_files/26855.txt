The estimated area covered under sowing in 2019-20 was 13646.32 thousand hectares while it was 13755.61 thousand hectares in 2020-21.(e) & (f) Import of pulses is allowed and the import quantity is determined taking into consideration overall availability and price situation to protect farmers’ and consumers’ interest.
