ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f) :  The quantum of paddy production (in terms of rice) in the country during the last three years till date, State-wise/year-wise is given at Annexure – ITo provide remunerative prices to paddy farmers, the Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of 22 mandated agricultural crops, including two varieties of paddy, Paddy (Common) and Paddy (Grade A), on the basis of recommendation of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSP. While recommending MSP, the CACP considers cost of production, overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sectors, likely effect of price policy on rest of economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production. The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of at least 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19.	Accordingly, the Government has increased the MSP of Paddy (Common) for 2021-22 season and fixed it at Rs.1940 per quintal and Paddy (Grade A) to Rs.1960 per quintal. The MSP of paddy for 2021-22 season provides 50% return over the CACP’s estimated all India weighted average cost of production including family labour.
