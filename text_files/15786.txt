ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d) 	Pollution load in rivers has increased over the years due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, open defection, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution of rivers. 	As per the  Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into water bodies.Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of effluents into rivers inter alia, include issuance of notification of specific  discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing  directions to all State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/consent to operate by the SPCBs/PCCs, Yearly inspections of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) by CPCB under Pollution Inventorisation Assessment  Survey (PIAS) for compliance verification through third party technical institutes, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status. In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their waste water generation by technological advancement, reuse/recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible.		Further, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), SPCBs and PCCs monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. According to CPCB, there are 2747 GPIs in the country which are discharging their effluents in various water bodies. Out of a total of 2747 industries, 2500 industries are operational and 247 industries self-closed. Number of complying and non-complying units are 2225 and 275 respectively.  State-wise status of GPI units in the country along with status of compliance and action taken for noncompliance is given in Annexure. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†4305 to be answered on the 19th March, 2019 regarding Discharge of Untreated Water into Rivers State-wise Statistics of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs)S.
