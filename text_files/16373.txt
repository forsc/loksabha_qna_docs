ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): The NEP 2020 has been finalised after detailed consultation process with all stakeholders including State/UT Governments. As per National Education Policy 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Accordingly, this Ministry has communicated to all States/UT Governments for implementation of NEP 2020 in letter and spirit. Ministry of Education is also organising ‘Shikshak Parv’ from 8th September to 25th September, 2020 to deliberate on various themes and implementation of NEP 2020 aimed at eliciting suggestions.  Ministry has also organised a Conference of Governors, Lt. Governors and Education Ministers on “Role of National Education Policy in Transforming Higher Education”. Governors and Lt. Governors of State and Union Territories, Education Minister of State and UTs, Vice Chancellors of State Universities and other dignitaries participated in the Conference. There has been wide publicity with a positive and overwhelming response from stakeholders on NEP 2020.(e): The Government is committed to improve the quality of education. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act came into effect from 1st April 2010. The Act makes elementary education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years. Samagra Shiksha an Integrated Scheme for School Education has been launched by Government of India from 2018-19, by subsuming the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). The scheme provides for support to the States and UTs for implementation of the RTE Act. NEP 2020 provides for universal access and affordable opportunity to all children of the country to obtain quality holistic education–including vocational education - from pre-school to Grade 12.**********
