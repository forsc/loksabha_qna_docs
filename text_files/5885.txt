                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SHRI R. K.

As per provision of the Scheme Central Financial Assistance (CFA) up to 30% of the benchmark cost or the tender cost of the stand-alone solar pump whichever is lower, will be provided. However, in North Eastern States, Sikkim, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Lakshadweep and A&N Islands, CFA will be up to 50% of the benchmark cost or tender cost, whichever is lower. The State Government will also give a subsidy of 30%. The cost of solar water pump depends upon the size and type of the pump.

Allocation of capacity to the States/UTs will be made on the basis of demand received from the States/UTs and target capacity available under the Scheme.*****
