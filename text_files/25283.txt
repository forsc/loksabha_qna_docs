ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): The National Testing Agency (NTA) has been established by the Government in 2018 as a premier, specialized, autonomous and self-sustainedtesting organization to conduct entrance examinations for admission/fellowship in higher educational institutions. NTA has successfully conducted 72 examinations (Computer and Internet based - 68, Pen & Paper based-04) since December 2018, which include: NEET (UG), JEE (Main), UGC-NET, JNUEE, DUET, ICAR-AIEE, IGNOU, CSIR-NET & AISSEE, etc.(c): NTA has created a network of Test Practice Centres (TPCs), for the candidates, especially in remote and rural areas to enable them to practice the previous years question papers through Mock Tests and be comfortable in taking a Computer Based Test (CBT). This facility is completely free of cost. Candidates can register online (on NTA website) where they are provided a convenient TPC nearer to their location, to practice on a given computer node. A list of TPCs (State-wise) is attached as Annexure. The TPCs are not functioning now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the opening of TPCs is subject to the improvement of COVID-19 situation.(d): NTA has launched a mobile app called ‘National Test Abhyas’ to enable candidates to take mock tests for JEE (Main) and NEET (UG). Students across the country can use this App to access high quality test practice, free of cost for preparation of the upcoming JEE (Main) and NEET (UG) Exams. To ensure test security and curb malpractices due to technological advancement, NTA has adopted various measures, which includes CCTV surveillance, installation of network jammers / signal silencers at Exam Centres, Orientation programme for test developers/ subject experts and exam functionaries.(e): As NTA is a self-sustained organization, the fees charged from the candidates are kept at the minimum for meeting the input costs and administrative costs only.*****
