ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN] (a)      India is actively engaged in various multilateral forums like G20, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS. Being the founding member of G20 and BRICS processes, India has played an active and important role in shaping the outcome of the Summits. BRICS cooperation is broadly covered under Economic, political & security, and people-to-people exchanges. The New Development Bank (NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) are the major outcomes of BRICS.India also attaches special importance to SCO in promoting multilateral, political, security, economic and people-to-people interaction in the region. India has maintained extensive engagement in all fields under the SCO framework since attaining full membership in June, 2017.All SCO Council of Heads of State Meeting have been attended by Prime Minister since 2017. SCO Council of Heads of Government Meetings in 2017 and 2018 were attended by Hon’ble EAM and in 2019 by Hon’ble Raksha Mantri. India has also attended all Ministerial level meetings. India will be hosting the SCO Council of Heads of Government Meeting and two Ministerial Level Meetings in 2020. India will be Chair of BRICS in 2021 and host BRICS Leaders Summit, various Ministerial and official meetings, and people-to-people engagements in 2021. India will also hold G20 Presidency in 2022 and will hold Summit and other G20 meetings. (b)    India has a merchandise trade surplus with USA, which has shown a declining trend in the last few years i.e. from US$ 24.38 billion in 2016 to US $ 20.85 billion in 2018 as per Census Bureau figures. This is on account of higher import of energy products like crude petroleum & gas, aircrafts, etc., in the recent years.           As per DGCIS data, India’s trade with China decreased from USD 89.71 billion in 2017-18 to USD 87.07 billion in 2018-19. During this period, India’s imports from China declined from USD 76.38 billion in 2017-18 to USD 70.32 billion in 2018-19, and our exports grew from USD 13.33 billion in 2017-18 to USD 16.75 billion in 2018-19. As a result, India’s trade deficit with China reduced from USD 63.05 billion to USD 53.57 billion in the said period.The Government of India has been consistently making efforts for achieving a more balanced trade with China in all our official engagements with the Chinese Government, requesting them to lower trade barriers for Indian exports to China. Various protocols have been signed to facilitate export of Indian rice, rapeseed meal, tobacco and fishmeal/fish oil, and chilli meal from India to China.The Government of India has also taken various measures to extend support to exporters by facilitating Buyers Sellers Meets between potential Chinese importers and Indian exporters to increase exports. In addition, Indian exporters are encouraged to participate in major trade fairs in China to showcase Indian products.***
