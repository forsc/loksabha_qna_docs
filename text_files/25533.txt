                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 crore Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of “Housing for All”. The identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-G is based on the housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC)-2011 subject to due verification by the Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process. An exercise for identification of households, who though eligible for assistance under PMAY-G as per the parameters specified under SECC 2011 but could not be included in the list of eligible beneficiaries (taking into account all the parameters that are required for becoming eligible to be a beneficiary of PMAY-G as per Framework for Implementation of PMAY-G) and creating additional list of eligible households was carried out by Ministry of Rural Development through the States / Union Territories (UTs) using Mobile Application “Awaas+”. The survey was started in January 2018 and the deadline provided to the states for concluding the data collection exercise initially was 31st March 2018 which was extended 4 times and the States/UTs had captured details of 3.57 crore households under the survey, which was ended on 7th March 2019.   From the list of 3.57 crore registrations on Awaas+, as there was a need for filtration of genuinely deprived households for providing the benefit under the scheme and therefore, Expert Committees were constituted and the reports of the committees were received and accepted by the Ministry. Further, the Union Cabinet while approving continuation of PMAY-G had given approval for inclusion of additional eligible households from the final Awaas+ list into the Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G, with a ceiling of 2.95 cr. The Union Cabinet had also approved that the targets from the final Awaas+ list will be allocated to those States /UTs who have exhausted their Permanent Wait List of SECC 2011. The Ministry had allocated Awaas+ target of 8.5 lakh to the States for FY 2020-21 to five eligible State/UT namely Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Ladakh and Sikkim based on recommendations of the Expert Committees. In addition to this the ministry has also allocated targets of 42.49 lakh from Awaas+ for the year 2021-22. The State wise targets allocated from final Awaas+ to eligible States/UTs so far are given at Annexure. (b): No Sir(c): Does not arise(d): The eligible households whose details have been captured during Awaas+ survey are covered under PMAY-G subject to the ceiling of construction of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G.******
