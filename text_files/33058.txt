                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a): Video conferencing emerged as the mainstay of the Courts during the Covid lockdown period as physical hearings and normal court proceedings in the congregational mode were not possible. Since Covid lockdown started, the District courts heard 1,08,36,087 cases while the High Court heard 57,39,966 cases (totalling 1.65 cr) till 30.11.2021 using video conferencing only. The Supreme Court held 1,81,909 hearings till 08.01.2022 since the beginning of lockdown period, making it the world leader in Video Conferencing hearings.One video conference equipment each has been provided to all Court Complexes including taluk level courts and additionally funds have been sanctioned for additional VC equipment for 14,443 court rooms. Funds for setting up 2506 VC Cabins have been made available. Additional 1500 VC Licenses have been acquired. VC facilities are already enabled between 3240 court complexes and corresponding 1272 jails. A sum of Rs. 7.60 crore has been released for procurement of 1732 Document Visualizers.Virtual Courts is a concept, aimed at eliminating the presence of litigant or lawyer in the court and for adjudication of cases on a virtual platform.
