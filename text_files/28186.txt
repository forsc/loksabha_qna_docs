                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	As per data on Police Organisations compiled by Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), out of the actual strength of 20,91,488 police personnel in States/UTs as on 01.01.2020, the strength of women police personnel is 2,15,504 which is 10.30%.  The details of women police officers at each level in the States/UTs is at Annexure.(c) to (g):	“Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to recruit more women police personnel including improvement of gender balance. The Centre also issues advisories to the States for increasing number of women in the police forces. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories dated 22.04.2013, 21.05.2014, 12.05.2015,   21.06.2019 and 22.06.2021 to all the State Governments to increase the representation of women police to 33% of the total strength. All the State Governments have been requested to create additional posts of women Constables/Sub-Inspectors by converting the vacant posts of male constables. The aim is that each police station should have at least 3 women Sub-Inspectors and 10 women police Constables, so that a women help desk is manned round the clock. States have also been advised to strengthen welfare measures for women police personnel and ensure their safety and a conducive work environment such as provision of housing and medical facilities and restroom facilities for women police personnel in Police Stations to attract women to the Police Force.******
