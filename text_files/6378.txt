ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’)a)    No Sir. The aim of INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship Scheme of Department of Science and Technology (DST) is to enable talented young post-doctoral (post-Ph.D.) scientists, through an attractive fellowship (recently increased from Rs. 80,000/- to Rs. 1,25,000/- p.m.) and a research grant (Rs.7 lakhs per year) to establish themselves as independent researchers so that they could become more competitive for finding academic and/or research positions in various institutions of the country.b)	No Sir. The regular academic/research jobs fall under the domain of various academic/research institutions and appointment against such posts are governed by various institution-specific criteria. To highlight the availability of such talented young scientists for openings in academic/research institutions, DST has already written to heads of all academic and research institutions, where INSPIRE Faculty Fellows are availing their fellowships to consider them for possible regular appointment in  their institutions subject to their fulfilling the institutional criteria. DST has also written to Chief Secretaries of all States to consider them for absorption in their respective State academic/research institutions. c)    Department of Science and Technology has informed that INSPIRE Faculty awardees, once absorbed, become regular employees of the institutions, and no discrimination cases have been reported to DST so far after their absorption as regular employees. d)          Does not arise.           *******
