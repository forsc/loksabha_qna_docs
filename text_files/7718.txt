Government has taken a number of steps towards expansion of the organized sector. These are as under: Under the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Labour & Employment, there has been a significant improvement in the registration of beneficiaries and 1.2 crores number of employees benefitted in the last three year, which is an indication of shifting   from informal sector to the formal sector for availing the Social Security Benefits.  In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganized sector including workers in agriculture sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes  for  unorganized  workers  on  matters relating to: (i) life and Contd..2/-:: 2 ::disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganized workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share without any burden on the beneficiary. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of minimum assured monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of         Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganized workers after attaining the age of 60 years. Prescribed monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government.******
