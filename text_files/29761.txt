ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)  ‘Rural roads’ is a state subject. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention launched by Government of India on 25th December, 2000 for providing connectivity by way of an all weather road to the eligible unconnected habitations as per core-network with a population of 500 persons in plain areas. In respect of Special Category States (i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand), the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission), the objective is to connect eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (Census 2001). For most intensive Integrated Action Plan (IAP) blocks as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs the unconnected habitations with population 100 and above (as per 2001 Census) is eligible to be covered under PMGSY.  As the programme unfolded, a need was felt for consolidation of the existing Rural Road Network to improve its efficiency not only as a provider of transportation services, but also as a vehicle of social and economic development. Accordingly, in the year 2013, PMGSY-II was launched for upgradation of selected Through Routes and Major Rural Links (MRLs) with a target to upgrade 50,000 Km in various States and Union Territories.  Subsequently, in 2016, Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads was launched in thw 9 LWE affected states, as a separate vertical under PMGSY. In the year 2019, Government launched PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  Thus, the objective of PMGSY has been to provide connectivity and to consolidate the existing rural network by linking them to through routes, major district roads, state highways and national highways with a focus to develop the rural areas of the country.(b) As on 30.11.21,  the State/UT wise details of road works constructed during the last three years and the current year under all the 4 verticals of PMGSY  (PMGSY-I, II, III & RCPLWEA) including that of Chhattisgarh are given at Annexure-I. (c)        Under PMGSY, funds are released by the Central Government for construction of roads which leads to the development of the villages in rural areas. During the last three years and the current year, State/ UT wise details of funds released and expenditure incurred (including state share) under all the 4 verticals of PMGSY  (PMGSY-I, II, III & RCPLWEA) are given at Annexure-II. (d) & (e)       The third phase of PMGSY was launched in 2019. The State/UT wise details of length allocated, sanctioned and constructed under PMGSY-III including that of Chhattisgarh are given at Annexure-III  ********
