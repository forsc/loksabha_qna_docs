ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) conducted an audit of India in November, 2015 and November, 2017 wherein the Effective Implementation (EI) was 57.44%. The fall in EI was mainly due to lack of regulation and oversight on Air Traffic Controllers which are required to be licensed as per standards laid down by ICAO and low EI in areas of Accident Investigation and Aerodromes. Further, the EI has risen to approximately 73.6 %, as per the audit conducted by ICAO in November, 2018 covering areas which included Legislation, Organisation, Air Navigation Services, Aerodromes and Accident Investigation etc.(b) The year-wise incidents, associated with the operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of operation, from 2013 to 2020(till 13.03.2020) are as follows:Year   No. of Incidents2013            6602014            6972015            5732016	           627 2017            6782018            6982019            7142020               126;The details of the incidents of 2011 and 2012 are not available with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation(DGCA) as per their record retention requirements.;The causative factors arising from incidents investigation reveals that about 70-80% incidents occurred due to engineering / technical issues including system component failure, about 15-20% on account of operational issues including non-adherence of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), unstabilised approach, checklist procedure, etc., and about 5-10% on account of human errors.(c) To prevent aviation incidents due to faulty parts an aircraft is maintained as per the detailed procedures / guidelines and timelines provided by the manufacturer of the aircraft which forms part of the approved maintenance programme of the operator. The aircraft is thus maintained continuously following the approved maintenance programme. In case there is a technical fault in aircraft parts, the aircraft cannot be released for flight unless the faulty parts is replaced with serviceable parts or fault in the part is rectified. In addition, the DGCA carries out surveillance/ spot checks of the maintenance organisations/ air operators at regular intervals for ensuring that the aircraft are maintained as per manufacturers'' instructions and faults in aircraft parts are rectified before the aircraft is released for service. In case of violations, enforcement action is taken against the organisations/ personnel responsible for the lapse.;
