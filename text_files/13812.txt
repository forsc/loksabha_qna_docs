ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (e): India had proactively taken on the complete phase out of HCFC 141 b, which is a chemical used by foam manufacturing enterprises, as on  1.1.2020.  As part of the Ministry’s commitment for moving towards environment friendly technologies, the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2019 under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, were notified  [S.O. 4724 (E) dated 31st December 2019] in the Gazette of India, inter alia prohibiting the issuance of import license for HCFC-141b from 1st January, 2020. With notification of Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2019, prohibiting the import of HCFC 141 b, the country has completely phased out HCFC 141b in the country. The use of HCFC-141b in all types of foam manufacturing is prohibited from 1.1.2020 under the earlier notified Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2014. This is in line with the commitment of the country under the Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.The Ministry is providing technical and financial assistance to foam manufacturing enterprises under Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase out Management Plan (HPMP), through UNDP, the lead implementing agency for ongoing HPMP, in order to help them transition to non-HCFC 141b and low Global Warming Potential technologies. Funds for the implementation of HPMP are provided by the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of Montreal Protocol to developing countries including India, for achieving compliance targets under the Montreal Protocol. Noting the challenges faced by the foam manufacturing enterprises in technology conversion, the Ministry has entered into an Agreement with the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology, Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals, to facilitate and hand-holding foam manufacturing enterprises. As part of assistance made available to the enterprises, technology workshops, field trials, on-site demonstration and support, practical hands on training and product validation are being provided. Already enterprises assisted for stabilizing alternative technologies have been able to move towards adoption of alternatives at commercial scale. As per the Montreal Protocol compliance requirement, India had to ban the import and use of HCFC-141b, pure or contained in pre-blended polyols no later than 1 January 2020 in all foam manufacturing sectors. The ban has been imposed vide Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2014 and 2019. *****
