The levy is imposed on each departure of the aircraft on Trunk routes, subject to certain exemptions. Airlines are free to pay the levy as per mechanism devised by them.;(b) and (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation / Directorate General of Civil Aviation has been receiving grievances related to air transport including on the airfare charges payable by the public. They are redressed as per the established mechanism / extant guidelines in the matter. Further, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Air-Sewa Application - a digital platform, for enabling travellers to submit grievances and seek information on air travel in India. Passengers may report their grievances on Air-Sewa Application for expeditious disposal.
