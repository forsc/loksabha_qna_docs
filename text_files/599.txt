ANSWER




                                                        (a) The potential of fishery resources available in our jurisdictional waters is periodically revisited through Expert Committees constituted from time to time. The last such Working Group of Experts was constituted on 24th August 2017 for revalidation of potential fishery resources available and to estimate the additional marine fisheries potential that could be harvested on a sustainable basis from different depth, zones and regions of India’s sovereign waters. The Working Group has submitted its report on 26.9.2018, wherein potential yield of Indian EEZ is estimated as 5.31 million metric tonnes. Against this potential, the production from marine fisheries in 2017-18 has been recorded as 3.69 million metric tonnes (Provisional). This indicates that marine fisheries resources are not overexploited. (b)  A component namely, ‘Development of Marine Fisheries, Infrastructure and Post Harvest Operations’ exist under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme ‘Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries’, under which central financial assistance is provided to the States/Union Territories for development of fisheries related infrastructure facilities. Besides, a new Scheme namely, ‘Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund’ (FIDF) amounting to Rs. 7,522.48 crore has been launched during 2018-19. (c) to (e) In order to introduce more positive economic and social outcomes for inshore fishing sector the Department of Fisheries, Government of India is implementing components like, motorizations of traditional crafts, procurement of FRP boats, construction of resource specific fishing vessels, mariculture activities, creating of shore based infrastructure facilities like fish landing centres, ice plants, cold storages and fish markets etc under the Blue Revolution scheme. Besides, assistance to fishermen for welfare activities like saving-cum-relief, insurance for fishers, construction of houses, community halls etc are also provided. Blue Revolution scheme is implemented, with focused attention to achieve economic prosperity of the fishers and to contribute towards food and nutritional security through full potential utilization of water resources in a sustainable manner. A ‘National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017’ has also been notified to guide the actions towards ensuring the health and ecological integrity of the marine living resources of India’s EEZ through sustainable harvests for the benefit of present and future generations of the nation. The Policy puts emphasis on sustainable development, principle of subsidiarity, inter-generational equity and precautionary approach. While keeping sustainability of the resources at the core of all actions, the policy framework proposes to meet the national, social and economic goals, livelihood sustainability and socio-economic upliftment of the fisher community and to guide the coordination and management of marine fisheries in the country.
