                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b): The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is being implemented for e-waste, and plastic waste management.In this regard, the following rules have been notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986:(i) E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016: The rules make it mandatory for producers of electrical and electronic equipment to obtain EPR authorization from CPCB by submitting an EPR plan. The phase wise collection of targets of e-waste has to be done at the rate of 10% of the quantity of waste generation as indicated in EPR plan for 2017-18 followed by a 10% increase in the consecutive years until 70% from 2023 onwards. In addition to existing producers, collection targets have been introduced for new producers, i.e. producers whose number of years of sales operations is less than average life of their products mentioned in the guidelines issued by the CPCB. The target for 2018-2020 will be 5% of the sales figure of financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively for each of the years, followed by a 5% increase every two years until 2025 after which it would be 20% of the sales figure of the year preceding the previous year. Producer have to ensure that the e-waste is channelized to authorized recyclers only.(ii)	Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016:  The rules mandate producers, importers and brand owners to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to their products based on Extended Producers Responsibility.  They have to work out modalities for waste collection system and involving State Urban Development Departments, either individually or collectively, through their own distribution channel or through the local body concerned.(c) Violation of E-waste management rules were reported in case of ten producers namely: (i)	M/s. Apple India Private Limited, (ii)	M/s. HP India Sales Private Limited,(iii)	M/s. Motorola Mobility India Pvt. Ltd., (iv)	M/s. Canon India Pvt. Ltd., (v)	M/s. Eltech Appliances Pvt. Ltd., (vi)	M/s. ETA General Pvt. Ltd., (vii)	M/s. Samsung India Electronics Pvt. Ltd., (viii)	M/s. Vivo Mobile India Pvt. Ltd., (ix)	M/s. BE Office Automation Products Pvt. Ltd., and (x)	M/s Tara Consultants Pvt. Ltd. The Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) Authorisation granted to these producers were suspended. Based on corrective measures taken by these producers, listed at sl. no. (i) to (viii) above, suspension of EPR authorisation was revoked. In addition, Maharashtra SPCB has issued directions to 9 dismantlers/recyclers and also issued closure notice to one unit for non-provision of air pollution control system. The Haryana SPCB has issued show cause notice to two non-compliant units. In order to ensure compliance of E-waste management rules, SPCBs/PCCs quarterly monitor the quantity of e-waste collected and channelized by producers and annually monitor the facilities of dismantlers and recyclers for their infrastructure and records. A software has been developed by CPCB where SPCBs/PCCs are required to upload their quarterly verification reports. *****
