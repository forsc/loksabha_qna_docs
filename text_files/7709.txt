                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	  	As per  Annual Report (July 2017-June 2018) on Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), Unemployment rate (UR) in rural and urban areas is as below:-	Rural Areas 	Urban AreasPLFS (2017-18)	Men	Women	Men	WomenUnemployment rate (UR)	5.8	3.8	7.1	10.8Contd…2/-::  2  ::(b) to (f):	In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector including rural and agricultural labourers, the Government has enacted the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs.3000/- will be provided to the unorganised workers after attaining the age of 60 years. Prescribed monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. Every welfare scheme has its separate monitoring mechanism.  Funds under PMJJBY/PMSBY and PM-SYM are not allocated to the State/UT governments, for implementation.  However, the expenditure incurred on Social Security Scheme of PMJJBY/PMSBY from the Social Security Fund maintained by LIC, during last three years towards providing insurance cover is as under:Year	Expenditure (Cr.)2016-17	385.342017-18	435.162018-19 	587.52The budget and expenditure details for the PM-SYM scheme is as under:Scheme	2018-19	2019-20 (as on 22.11.2019)	                           (Amount in Rs.

The welfare measures are formulated for the benefit of all unorganised workers, including agricultural labourers.********
