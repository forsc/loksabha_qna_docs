ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): There is no unmanned level crossing (UMLC) on Broad Gauge (BG) routes on Indian Railway.   However, as on 01.04.2020, total 948 UMLCs on Meter Gauge(MG) and Narrow Gauge (NG) are existing, which are planned for elimination alongwith Gauge Conversion works in future.  Statewise list of UMLC on Meter Gauge/ Narrow Gauge (MG/NG) is appended.(c) & (d): As on 01.04.2020, Railways have sanctioned 1566 Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and 6219 underpasses/ Road Under Bridges (RUBs)  in the country including Delhi/NCR, Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.   Government is actively considering the construction of underpasses and overbridges at various Level Crossings (LCs). However, the construction of ROB/RUBs depends upon the consent of State Government for closure of LCs & cost sharing, wherever applicable,  availability of encroachment free land for approach roads, technical feasibility, shifting of utilities,  allocation of adequate funds by State agencies, public support etc.  Therefore, it is not feasible to fix timelines for completion of these ROB/RUBs.(e): Railways has taken pro-active measures in close coordination with various stakeholders to improve the progress of construction of ROBs/RUBs/Subways as under:•	Joint survey with State Government to finalize the alignment & General Arrangement Drawing (GAD).•	Standardization of design & drawings for various spans. •	Regular coordination meeting with State Government officials.•	Construction of ROB on single entity basis.•	Monitoring of progress at different levels.*****
