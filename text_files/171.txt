Climate actions at the state level are based on the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC).Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority climate actions. The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change.  Under NAFCC, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States to tackle the issues related to adaptation in agriculture, water, forestry, etc. Government of India has also embarked upon ambitious actions in the areas of renewable energy, afforestation, energy efficiency, and urban development.The National Disaster Management Agency has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters such as cyclones, floods and heat wave. Further, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has modernized its observation system by installing a network of doppler weather radars, automatic weather stations, automatic rain gauge stations, etc. for monitoring abnormal weather patterns.
