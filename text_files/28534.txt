ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): As per National Mineral Inventory, the total resources of primary gold ore in the country as on 1.4.2015 are estimated at 501.83 million tonnes with 654.74 tonnes of gold metal and out of this, Bihar is endowed with 222.885 million tonnes (44%) of ore containing 37.6 tonnes of metal. These resources of gold in Bihar are categorized underUnited Nations Framework Classification[UNFC] code-333 (128.885 million tonnes containing 21.6 tonnes metal) and UNFC code-334 (94 million tonnes containing 16 tonnes metal). The entire resource of gold ore in Bihar is located in Sono area of Jamui district.(b) to (d): Yes, Sir. During the last five years, Geological Survey of India [GSI], an attached office of Ministry of Mines, has carried G4 stage ‘reconnaissance survey'' for gold in parts of West Champaran district and G3 stage ‘preliminary exploration’ in Gaya district of Bihar following the guidelines of UNFC. In West Champaran district, G4 stage exploration was carried out for placer gold in foothills of Siwalik Himalayas, but the average concentration of placer gold in this area is low (0.0061ppm to 1.96 ppm) and no resource has been estimated.  Mineral exploration/ assessment is a continuous process and a number of exploration agencies like GSI, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research, State Directorates of Geology and Mining, State/Central Undertakings and private sector companies are engaged in exploration of mineral deposits in the country. For mineral surveys in the country, GSI is the nodal agency to formulate mineral exploration programmes of various agencies through its Central Geological Programming Board. *****
