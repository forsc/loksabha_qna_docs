ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d): Yes, Sir. The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits And Services) Act, 2016 is an act to provide for, as a good governance, efficient, transparent, and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services, the expenditure for which is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India or the Consolidated Fund of the State to individuals residing in India through assigning of unique identity numbers (Aadhaar number) to such individuals.Any individual who has resided in India for a period or periods amounting in all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment or an NRI holding valid Indian passport are eligible for Aadhaar enrolment on providing valid documents at the enrolment centre within the country;As on 15th January 2021, a total of 127.83  Crore Aadhaar have been generated against the projected population (2020) of about 137.05 crore. However, the actual number of Aadhaar holders is lesser due to deaths. Hence, the concept of “Live Aadhaar” has been introduced to estimate the number of persons holding Aadhaar who are alive. It is estimated that the number of ‘Live Aadhaar’ stands at 123.49 crore. Overall Aadhaar (live) saturation in the country is 90.11%. As on 15th January 2021, more than 50,000 Aadhaar  counters are operational, which includes 23,706 of State Registrars, 11,270 of Banks, 10,003 of India Post, 4,617 of CSC e-Gov, 488 of UIDAI Aadhaar Seva Kendras, 370 of BSNL & 20 of UTIITSL.The details of Aadhaar Enrolment & Update Centres is made available to general public on the official website of UIDAI at the link https://appointments.uidai.gov.in/easearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 and on the mAadhaar App. In order to spread awareness about the centers, UIDAI has constantly been providing information through various platforms of Social Media.(e) and (f): Aadhaar number is a twelve-digit identification number which enables an Aadhaar number holder to establish his/ her identity.As per Section 4(3) of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, every Aadhaar number holder to establish his identity, may voluntarily use his Aadhaar number in physical or electronic from by way of authentication or offline verification or in such other form as may be notified, in such manner as may be specified by regulations.Section 4(6) of the Act provides that, every requesting entity, to whom an authentication request is made by an Aadhaar number holder under Section 4(3) of the Act, shall inform to the Aadhaar number holder of alternate and viable means of identification and shall not deny any service to him for refusing to, or being unable to, undergo authentication.Further, as per section 4(7) of the Act, mandatory authentication of an Aadhaar number holder for the provision of any service shall take place if such authentication is required by a law made by Parliament.*******
