ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2427 BY SHRI SUNIL BABURAO MENDHE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING PENDING RAILWAY PROJECTS. (a) & (b): 	As on 01.04.2021 across Indian Railways, 484 Railway projects (187 New Line, 46 gauge Conversion and 251 Doubling) of 51,165 Km length, costing approx. `7.53 lakh crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which, 10,638 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of approx. `2.14 lakh crore has been incurred upto March, 2021.Zonal Railway wise details of Railway projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways>Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Rail Budget/Pink Book (Year)> Railway wise Works Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme.Railway has reviewed all the projects based on last mile connectivity, missing links, traffic potential on the project, capacity enhancement, availability of land, forest/wild-life clearance etc. and based on the review, Railway projects have been prioritized. Presently, Railway’s focus is on completion of capacity enhancement projects and last mile connectivity projects. Budget outlay has been provided to the projects in a rationalized manner and budget has  been  allotted  to the projects which are in advance stage of completion, priority projects, important New Line & National projects, executable & important Gauge conversion projects and the projects which are important from the throughput enhancement considerations. Thus, focused attention is given in fund allotment, rather than thinly spreading the resources without commensurate results.Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in Budget allocation and commensurate commissioning of projects across Indian Railways. The Average Annual Budget allocation in the Indian Railways for New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects during 2014-19 has increased to `26,026 crore per year from `11,527 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 126% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. The Annual budget allocation for these Projects for Financial Year 2019-20 was `39,836 crore (246% more than average annual budget allocation during 2009-14) and `43,626 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (278% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation during 2009-14). For Financial year 2021-22, highest-ever budget outlay of `52,398 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 355% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. During 2014-21, 17,720 km length (3,681 km New Line, 4,871 km Gauge Conversion and 9,168 km Doubling) has been commissioned at an average of 2,531 km/year which is 67% more than the average commissioning during 2009-14 (1520 km/year). The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of cost share by State Government in cost sharing projects, priority of projects, shifting of infringing  utilities,  statutory  clearances  from  various  authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months  in  a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project(s) due to which the confirmed time frame for completion of projects cannot be ascertained at this stage. However, Railways is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects. (c): 	Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway wise and not State-wise as Indian Railways’ projects may span across various State boundaries.Maharashtra:As on 01.04.2021, 35 projects (16 New Line, 2 Gauge Conversion and 17 Doubling) of a total length of 6,142 km, costing `91,137 crore, falling fully/partly in Maharashtra are under different stages of planning/ approval/ execution, out of which 906 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `18,008 crore incurred upto March, 2021. Average Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year (during 2009-14) which is 310% more than average allocation during 2009-14 (`1171 crore/year). These allocations have been increased to `7,281 crore in Financial Year 2019-20 (522% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14) and `6,700 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (472% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14). For Financial Year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of ` 8,547 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 630% more than the Average Annual Budget Outlay of 2009-14 (`1171 crore per year). During 2014-21, 916 km sections (87 km New Line, 136 km Gauge Conversion and 693 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Maharashtra have been commissioned at an average rate 130.86 km per year, which is 124% more than average commissioning during 2009-14 (58.4 km/year).*******
