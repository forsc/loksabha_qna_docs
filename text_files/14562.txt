                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	As per the information furnished by States/UTs under the National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCB&VI), a statement showing the number of functional eye banks including eye donation centres, State/UT-wise,  is given at Annexure-I. 	The details of annual targets set for collection of donated eyes/corneas under NPCB&VI and the achievements thereof during the last three years and the current year (2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20), State/UT-wise, is given at Annexure-II.(c):	The constraints in achieving the targets for donated eyes/cornea collection in the country include lack of awareness, myths surrounding eye donation and inadequate eye banking facilities.(d):	As per the data reported by States/UTs under NPCB&VI, on an average 40-50 percent donated eyes/corneas are utilized for corneal transplantation annually. The donated eyes/corneas are assessed by eye surgeons prior to corneal transplantation for its suitability for optical keratoplasty.  Not all the collected corneas are found suitable for corneal transplantation because of various medical reasons, like poor quality of collected corneas due to age of the donor, pre-existing degeneration/diseases etc. Donated corneas, not found suitable for corneal transplantation, are utilized either for therapeutic keratoplasty or for study, training and research purposes. The following corrective steps have been taken under NPCB&VI to improve utilization rate of donated  corneas:1.	Recurring grant to eye banks for transportation, storage and collection of donated corneas,2.	Non-recurring grant to eye banks in public sector to meet the cost of ophthalmic equipments and instruments,3.	Free supply of short term and long term cornea preservation and storage medium to Government eye banks,4.	In-service training to eye surgeons in eye banking and Keratoplasty,5.	Training to para medical ophthalmic assistants in  enucleation of donated eyes/corneas.(e):	The following steps have been taken under NPCB&VI for creating adequate infrastructure for carrying out corneal transplantation:1.	Non-recurring grant to Eye Banks in public sector to meet the cost of identified ophthalmic equipments and instruments,2.	Provision of non-recurring grant to Regional Institutes of Ophthalmology and Government Medical Colleges to meet the cost of identified ophthalmic equipments for setting up of Eye Bank and Corneal transplantation Centres.
