ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)  to (c)  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.5166 BY SHRI HAJI FAZLUR REHMAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019 REGARDING DOUBLING/ ELECTRIFICATION OF TAPRI-MUZAFFARNAGAR RAIL LINE (a)	The work of doubling with electrification between Muzaffarnagar to Tapri (52 km) was sanctioned in 2015-16.  Cost of the project is  376.78 crore.  The work has been taken up.  The expenditure on this project up to March, 2019 is  188.25 crore and an outlay of  100 crore has been provided in the year 2019-20. (b)  and (c)  The timely commissioning of any Railway project  involves land acquisition by State Governments, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labor, order of Hon’ble Courts etc. All these factors affect the completion time and cost of the project due to which, confirmed timeline for completion of the project cannot be fixed at this stage.  However, in the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.Also, to ensure that projects are completed in time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        In addition, for important projects/capacity enhancement projects/ last mile connectivity projects etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of  1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’  capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
