ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a):	Yes, Sir.(b):	382 excess promotions were made in the grade of Inspector consequent to Restructuring order dated 19.07.2001 due to some confusion about upgradation of posts of Inspectors to the post of Superintendents. Cont……2/--	2 -CBIC, vide letter dated 24.10.2016 clarified that 382 posts of Inspectors which have been upgraded to the post of Superintendent are no longer available in the grade of Inspector prior to restructuring.  Regarding loss of government revenue, it is pointed out that officers who have worked as Inspectors in the meantime are entitled to the salary of Inspectors as they worked as Inspectors in the Department. No recovery has been made on this account. The amount of higher emoluments drawn due to higher pay fixation on account of ante-dated promotions has not been calculated as on date, as Review DPC on this issue was conducted only on 19.02.2021.(c):	The CBIC issued directions vide letters dated 24.10.2016 and 16.08.2019 to review such promotions. (d):	The Cadre Control reviewed the cadre position as per directions of CBIC and the Establishment orders were issued on 19.02.2021 setting off excess promotions in the grade of Inspectors.******
