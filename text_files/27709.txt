ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Public Private Partnership play an important role in the skilling and employment. (b)	The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY) through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) which had been set up as a Public Private Partnership initiative. The Ministry, through the NSDC, has taken up multiple initiatives to connect with industries for partnership under the Skill India Mission. There are 2188 Training Partners participating in the skill initiatives of the NSDC and all of them are private enterprises. 36 Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) have been set up as Industry led bodies which help in training need analysis, curriculum development, rolling out of training and assessment and certification. In addition, Directorate General of Training, MSDE has also signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with National Association of Software Services Companies (NASSCOM), IBM India Pvt. Ltd and SAP India Private Limited for conducting courses under CSR initiative of these private companies.  (c)	The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes integration between vocational and academic streams in all schools and higher education institutions in a phased manner. As per the said policy, vocational education will start in school from the 6th grade and will include internship. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship in collaboration with Ministry of Education has already initiated a pilot project on Hub and Spoke model.	 In Hub and Spoke model, Industrial Training Institutes (ITI)/ Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) will be leveraged as hub of vocational education and training (VET); schools will access the skill training from this hub as individual spokes. With this synergy, the school students would be exposed to the wide range of possibilities available in the world of work in their respective fields and learn on latest technologies available in the ITIs. The project aims to ensure that every young adult in 6 to 19 years of age cohort completes either 12 year of schooling with at least one certification of level 2 to 4 National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) certificate or 10 years of schooling & certification with 2 years of ITI programme. Currently, the Program is envisaged in 4 States viz; (i) Chhattisgarh (ii) Madhya Pradesh (iii) Odisha and (iv) West Bengal. These State Governments have identified 2 districts and a hub ITI in each district in their respective States. Mapping of spoke schools is being done by the State Governments concerned.  	Further, under the aegis of the MSDE, NSDC and its SSCs are facilitating the Ministry of Education for the implementation of the Samagra Shiksha scheme in 12,332 schools across 31 States and Union Territories (UTs), offering 125 job role-aligned courses across 21 Sectors, as on 2020-21. Under this initiative, more than 13 Lakh+ students are reportedly (by Ministry of Education) enrolled in 2020-21 academic year. 	In addition, Ministry through NSDC is supporting University Grant Commission for three schemes namely Community College, Bachelor of Vocational course (BVOC) &DeenDayal Upadhyaya Kaushal Kendras (DDUKK) which are being introduced in different colleges and universities. Sector Skill Councils are supporting the colleges/ universities to align their curriculum as per the NSQF approved Qualification pack and conduct the Skill Component assessment and certification.
