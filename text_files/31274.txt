ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c):  There are three Level Crossings (LCs) i.e. LC No. 62, 64 and 67 at Bilhaur on Kanpur-Kasganj section of North Eastern Railway.   Construction of Road Over Bridge/Road Under Bridge (ROB/RUB) at these locations is not feasible  due to limited space, as   National Highway (NH) runs parallel to railway track.There are two Level Crossings (LCs) at Kachhauna i.e. LC No. 258 on Lucknow-Moradabad section and 96B on Unnao-Balamau section of Northern Railway. LC No. 258:  ROB at this location had been sanctioned in 2016-17.  However, State Govt. did not find approaches feasible due to densely built up area. RUB is also not feasible  at this location because of built up private area nearby. LC No. 96B on Unnao-Balamau section falls on National Highway (NH).  As per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Ministry of Railway & MoRTH/ NHAI dated 10.11.2014, all LCs on NH corridors are to be replaced by ROBs/RUBs by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH)/ National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at their cost on single entity basis.
