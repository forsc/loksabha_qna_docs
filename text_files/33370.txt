ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). Under PMKVY, short term training is being imparted in accredited and affiliated skill development training centres across the country.Under PMKVY, since inception, i.e., 2015 till 31.12.2021, short term training has been imparted in 30,100 skill development training centres (TCs) including PMKKs across the country. These TCs were established without funding support from the Ministry.          Further, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) promotes establishment of model training centres in every district of the country known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK).  As on 15.01.2022, 813 PMKKs have been allocated across the country; out of which, 719 have been established. Further, for the establishment of PMKKs, Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to industrial partner / corporate for setting up of PMKK. PMKK centres are provided loan from NSDC up to Rs. 70 lakh to the PPP partner.(c) and (d)        Above reply (a) may be referred to. (e)       No, Sir. Under PMKVY, short term training is being imparted through skill development training centres (TCs) selected through robust accreditation and affiliation process on Skill India Portal (SIP). TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies including information technology (IT) interventions and measures namely; self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skill India Portal (SIP), Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS), social media platform, etc. Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of TCs. (f) to (h)          Under the scheme, PMKVY Monitoring Committee review the cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Under the scheme, there is provision for taking suitable action against erring / non-compliant training centres / stakeholders as per penalty grid framework. Based on the penalty grid, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), the implementing agency of PMKVY under MSDE, has suspended training centres for non-compliance of PMKVY guidelines on multiple parameters and periodically publishes the list on PMKVY official website. Under PMKVY, some complaints were received on various parameters in the Ministry, and NSDC and appropriate action on every complaint was taken. So far, 17 FIRs were lodged against the complaint received by the Ministry. Also, based on the monitoring framework of PMKVY, 307 Training Centres (TCs) have been suspended across the different locations. The State-wise no. of TCs suspended is given at Annexure.
