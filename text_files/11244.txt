                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 As such, there is no adverse effect of chemical fertilizers with balanced and judicious use as per recommendation. However, there is possibility of nitrate contamination in groundwater above the permissible limit of 10mg NO3 –N/L due to excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers particularly in light textured soils that has consequence on human/animal health if used for drinking purpose.   (b) & (c):	States are being encouraged to use bio-fertilizers by providing:i)	Rs. 50,000 per ha. in 3 years under Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY) for inputs including bio-fertilizers to farmers.ii)	Rs. 25,000 per ha. in 3 years under Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) for both on-farm & off-farm organic inputs including bio-fertilizers.(iii):	Rs.300 per ha. for fertilizer under National Mission on Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NMOP)  and  National Food Security (NFSM).Indian Council of Agriculture (ICAR) is implementing “Network project on soil biodiversity- bio fertilizers” with 18 cooperating centres and has developed improved and efficient strains of bio-fertilizers specific to different crops and soil types. ICAR study indicates that bio-fertilizers can improve crop yields by 10-25% and supplement costly chemical fertilizer (N, P) by nearly 20-25% in most of the cases when used along with the chemical fertilizers********
