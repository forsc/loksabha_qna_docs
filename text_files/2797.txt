The Security Forces have been given ‘free hand’ to tackle terrorism. National Investigation Agency (NIA) has been established for investigation of terrorism related cases.  Close and effective coordination mechanism   exists  between  intelligence   and    security   agencies  at the --2--L.S.US.Q. No. 2564 for 09.07.2019Centre and the State level.  The Multi Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it to function on 24x7 basis for real time collation and sharing of intelligence with the central / state Agencies concerned.  States have raised Special Forces to deal with terror incidents and Central Armed Police Forces & National Security Guards have also been stationed at different locations to assist the States in dealing with such incidents.  The Central Agencies have been organising capacity building programmes for the States forces regarding intelligence sharing and investigation of terror cases.  Terrorist activities have reduced significantly in the Hinterland of the country.  Insurgent / Extremist incidents have also reduced significantly in North Eastern States and in the Left Wing Extremism affected areas. In Jammu & Kashmir, security forces are proactively engaging with terrorists, resulting in neutralization of large number of terrorists.******
