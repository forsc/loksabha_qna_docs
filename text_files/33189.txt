                                                        MINISTER OF CULTURE, TOURISM AND DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH EASTERN REGION(G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (f):  A Statement is laid on the table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. * 76 FOR REPLY ON 07.02.2022(a) to (e) Total sanctioned strength of the eight museums under Ministry of Culture (Salar Jung Museum, Allahabad Museum, National Museum, Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial Hall Museum, National Gallery of Modern Art, National Council of Science Museums and Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sanghrahalaya) is 1675, of which 1309 (i.e. 78.15%) are currently filled up. The sanctioned strength, actual strength and vacancy position in respect of various museums in the country, is placed at Annexure 1. Filling up of posts is a continuous process and steps are taken to ensure that the vacancies are filled in time through issuing advertisements, sending requisitions to UPSC/SSC, revision of Recruitment Rules wherever required, holding DPC and selections etc. The vacancies have not adversely affected the functioning of the museums or resulted in any damage. It may be noted that most of the museums have taken steps to upgrade their infrastructure such as re-curating galleries; digitizing their collections through Jatan software and Google Arts; improved illumination; use of AR/VR technologies; setting up offsite museums, among other improvements. (f)	Vacancies in the museums have accrued on account of natural attrition, voluntary resignations, promotion to higher grade, non eligibility of eligible candidates in feeder grades etc. A total of 431 vacancies have been deemed abolished in the museums. However, it is pointed out that steps have also been taken to revive these posts with approval of Ministry of Finance wherever necessary. For instance, 27 posts of National Museum have been revived and process is underway for revival of 4 posts of NGMA.ANNEXURE 1Annexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 76 for 07.02.2022Sanctioned strength, actual strength and vacancy position in respect of various museums in the country:Sl No.	Name of the Museum	Sanctioned strength	Actual	Vacancy1.
