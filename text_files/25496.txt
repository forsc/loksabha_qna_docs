The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including crime   against   women   are  with   the respective State Governments. However, as part of several initiatives for safety of women by the Government, Safe City  Projects have been sanctioned by the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Nirbhaya  Fund  scheme in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow  and Mumbai). These projects involve identification of hot spots for crimes against women and deployment of various components including infrastructure, technology adoption, and capacity building in community through awareness programmes. The project implementation is regularly reviewed by the State Level Apex Committee. Specific details are not maintained in the Ministry. However, details of funds released to States/UT by the Ministry, year-wise, for implementation of the projects are at Annexure. (b) & (c): The criteria for selection of next batch of cities have not been decided. Further, new projects would be dependent on demand assessment and project feasibility. (d) & (e): Safe City project guidelines provide the States/UT to converge with other ongoing projects/schemes, including Smart City Project. *****
