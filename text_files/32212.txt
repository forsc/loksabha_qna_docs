ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Under the Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) with an objective to provide skilling to prospective youth including persons with disability (PwD) under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country. Under PMKVY, there are certain incentives to encourage participation of PwDs in the skill training, namely, post placement support, monthly conveyance allowance, boarding and lodging, etc. Further, there is an exclusive Sector Skill Council for PwD, namely, Skill Council for PwD (SCPwD) for catering to the needs of the PwD candidates and run training in PwD-friendly training centres (TCs). Such centres are structurally designed to enable PwD candidates to experience training with ease. In addition, other Training Centres can also enroll differently-abled candidates. As on 21.11.2021, under STT component of PMKVY, around 48 thousand PwD candidates have been trained/oriented under 191 training centres (out of which 185 TCs are under SCPwD). The State/UT – wise details are given at Annexure. In long-term skilling, 9,105 PwD candidates have been enrolled in 2019 and 2020 session in 3,681 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) across the country.(b)       Under PMKVY, there are various provisions for monitoring of TC as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrolment – training – assessment – certification - placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill India Portal (SIP) which is linked with Aadhaar-enabled biometric attendance. TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process and PMKVY Monitoring Committee reviews and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of TCs. (c)        Above reply (b) may be referred to. (d)       Under PMKVY, there is no provision of earmarking separate funds for Divyangjan (PwD) candidates. (e)       Under PMKVY, training is being imparted through accredited and affiliated Training Centres which can be a private entity, Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs), etc. As on 21.11.2021, 191 training centres have imparted training to Divyangjan PwD candidates across the country.
