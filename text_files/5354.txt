                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)  to (e):	There are 6.92 crore active Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) against 14.5 crore operational landholdings which means there are a substantial number of farmers outside the ambit of KCC. To bring the maximum number of farmers under KCC in order to provide them access to concessional institutional credit, Government has started a campaign to achieve saturation under KCC in MISSION MODE and in a time bound manner for the farmers. In this regard, necessary directions have been issued to waive off processing fee, inspection, ledger folio charges and all other service charges for all crop loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh and State Governments have been advised to hold bank-wise and village-wise camps to collect KCC application forms from eligible farmers and the applications collected therein. These applications have to be submitted to the concerned bank branch and banks have been advised to issue KCC within 2 weeks from the receipt of completed application. The progress is to be monitored by State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC).	Review and modification in the scheme is a continuous process based on inputs from stakeholders and changes are made from time to time for better implementation. 	  ********
