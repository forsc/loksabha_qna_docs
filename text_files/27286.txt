                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) and (b)  Yes Sir. Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has formulated a Scrapping Policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles and replace them with fuel efficient, environment friendly, new generation vehicles.

GSR Notification 191 (E) dated 15.03.2021- The Notification provides for revision of registration fee, fitness testing fee and fitness certification fee of vehicles. The initiative is towards creation of an ecosystem for phasing out of older polluting vehicles. 4. GSR Notification 220 (E) dated 26.03.2021- The Notification provides for concession in the motor vehicle tax for the vehicle registered against submission of a certificate regarding scrapping of the old vehicle. 5.
