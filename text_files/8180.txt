SINGH)(a) Presently, the domestic solar cell and module manufacturers have the following disadvantages:(i) The country does not have a manufacturing base for Polysilicon, Ingots and wafers, the upstream stages of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing chain, which is energy & capital intensive process.(ii) Lack of integrated set up, economies of scale & modern technology resulting in higher cost of production.(iii) High cost of land and electricity, low capacity utilization, high cost of financing, and lack of skilled workforce.The above factors result in domestic solar products being more expensive than those imported from China. (b) Based on the information available on the website of Export Import Data Bank of Department of Commerce, the details of import of solar cells/photovoltaic cells whether or not assembled in module/ panel, under the Customs Tariff Head (CTH) 85414011, are given in Annexure-I.(c) As per the data provided by solar PV manufacturers, the total solar PV panel manufacturing capacity in the country is around 10 GW. (d) & (e) The production of solar PV cells and modules in India is supported by the Government of India by way of following initiatives:(i)  Domestic manufacturing of solar cells and panels in India is being supported by the Government of India through Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) of Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology. The scheme, inter alia, provides for: •	20-25% subsidy for investments in capital expenditure for setting up of the manufacturing facility; and •	Reimbursement of countervailing Duty (CVD)/ Excise Duty for capital equipment for the units outside Special Economic Zone (SEZ).(ii)  Based on the final findings of Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) in investigations concerning imposition of Safeguard Duty on import of solar cells/ modules, the Government, through notification no. 01/2018-Customs (SG) dated 30th July, 2018, have imposed Safeguard duty on import of solar cells whether or not assembled in modules or panels, as follows:•	twenty five percent, ad valorem minus anti-dumping duty payable, if any, when imported during the period from 30th July, 2018 to 29th July, 2019 (both days inclusive);•	twenty percent, ad valorem minus anti-dumping duty payable, if any, when imported during the period from 30th July, 2019 to 29th January, 2020 (both days inclusive);•	fifteen percent, ad valorem minus anti-dumping duty payable, if any, when imported during the period from 30th January, 2020 to 29th July, 2020 (both days inclusive);However, nothing contained in the notification dated 30th July, 2018, mentioned above shall apply to imports of subject goods from countries notified as developing countries vide notification no. 19/2016-Customs (N.T.) dated 5th February, 2016, except China PR, and Malaysia.(iii) Government have approved a Scheme for setting up of solar PV power plants by Government Producers [Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs)/ State Public Sector Undertakings (SPSUs)/ Government Organizations, etc.], as per extant Guidelines, in a World Trade Organization (WTO) compliant manner, using domestically manufactured solar PV cells and modules to encourage Make in India in solar PV manufacturing sector. (iv)  Further, solar PV power projects being implemented under other Schemes of Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) like PM- KUSUM and Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar Programme Phase-II are also mandated to source their requirement of solar PV cells and modules from domestic sources, as per extant Guidelines, in a WTO compliant manner.(v) The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) vide its O.M.

Minimum Percentage of local content required is 100% in case of solar modules and 40% for other components such as inverter, etc.(vi)  The Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI)) has concluded bidding for a tender for setting up of Solar PV Power plants linked to setting up of Solar PV Manufacturing facilities.*****
