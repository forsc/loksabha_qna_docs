ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) and (b): Ministry of Railways (MoR) has formulated a Participative Policy, 2012 to encourage the investment in developing rail connectivity by associating strategic partners and other investors. The policy defines five Public Private Partnership models viz. Non-Government Railway (NGR), Joint Venture (JV), Customer Funded, Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and BOT-annuity models. State Governments/Local bodies/PSUs may also participate as stakeholder for the development of new lines/gauge conversion project under the participative policy of MoR. In all such Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects, train operation and revenue collection continues to remain with Railway. However, such entities get a share of revenue in lieu of owing/maintaining the infrastructure. The PPP mode has been found to be quite successful in Railways, especially in providing last mile rail connectivity to many ports and industrial clusters.So far, 14 projects of ` 9,234 Crore have already been completed through PPP mode. 10 more projects of ` 19,417 Crore are under implementation including coal connectivity and port connectivity projects and in addition, 7 more projects of ` 13,971 Crore have already been granted In-Principle approval, which are under development stage. (c): Various steps being taken by Government for effective and speedy implementation of rail projects include: (i)    Prioritisation of projects. (ii)   Substantial increase in allocation of funds on priority projects.(iii)  Delegation of powers at field level.(iv)  Close monitoring of projects at various levels and(v) Regular follow-up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forest and wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects.****
