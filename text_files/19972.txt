                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (d):  	No such proposal is under consideration in this Department.The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Control Order, 2015, issued under the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, 1955 covers only foodgrains under its ambit. As per clause 10(1) of the TPDS (Control) Order, 2015, the State/UT Governments through their licensed Fair Price Shops (FPSs) disburse foodgrains to the ration card holders as per their entitlement under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). Further, this Department had advised all State/UT Governments to implement ‘Special Dispensation of Foodgrains’ for NFSA beneficiaries who are above sixty five years of age or who are differently-abled, and have no other adult family member (16 to 65 years) listed in their ration card, and are not in a position to visit the FPS themselves to receive their foodgrains. Thus, it is advised that all such beneficiaries would be eligible under special dispensation of foodgrains through either (i) Home delivery of the entitled quota of foodgrains, or (ii) Delivery through authorized nominees of such beneficiaries.****
