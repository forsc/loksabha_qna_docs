ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, Sir. The Government through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) had commissioned the Global Skill Gap Study in 2019 for mapping international job opportunities for skilled India workers in the blue and grey-collared categories. (b)	The study highlights nations that would face workforce shortage in the foreseeable future and presents sectoral demand in top 15 countries until 2030 as below:I.	In United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Qatar shall be approximately 2.63 million across major sectors such as Construction (1.17 million), Wholesale and Retail Trade (0.42 million), Real Estate and Rental and Business Services (0.28 million).II.	In Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland shall be approximately 0.30 million across major sectors such as Health and Social Care (0.11 million), Manufacturing (0.05 million).III.	In Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada 95 million across major sectors such as Health Care and Social Assistance (United States of America (USA), Japan and Malaysia shall be approximately 0.0.22 million), Construction (0.10 million).A letter of intent is underway between the Ministry of Immigration, Quebec and MSDE to launch a Recruitment Mission to mobilize skilled Indian workers from India to Quebec in the sectors of Healthcare, retail and hospitality. The process has slowed down due to COVID-19.(c) 	NSDC is working with the Ministry of Human Resource and Emiritization (MoHRE) and Abu Dhabi Quality and Conformity Council (ADQCC) for benchmarking qualifications, assessment and certification. In October, 2018, benchmarking of 16 UAE skill qualifications to 13 Indian skill qualifications in construction and automotive sectors was conducted by the technical teams of NSDC and ADQCC. In August, 2019, a pilot programme was initiated. 133 candidates were assessed on mutually recognized qualifications. 63 candidates were interviewed and selected by the UAE employer out of which 18 candidates were deployed in the UAE. In respect of KSA, in the first phase, 5 occupations were benchmarked between India and KSA. Pilot programme for 100 workers was conducted and Recognition of Prior Learning assessment has been undertaken, out of which 81 candidates have successfully cleared the assessment and were issued joint certification in February, 2020. Under the Joint Working Group Mechanism, meetings with Japan, Germany, Australia and United Kingdom have been held.(d)      No, Sir. (e)  No time schedule is fixed for finalization of job opportunities for skilled Indian workers abroad as this is a continuous activity. All international initiatives have slowed down due to COVID-19.
