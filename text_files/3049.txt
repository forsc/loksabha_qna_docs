(b)    With the digitization of several activities on Indian Railways such as the introduction of Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS), Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVM) for ticketing and extensive use of e-tickets and online forms, etc., the need for printing of card tickets and general forms in the printing presses has diminished rendering nine printing presses including the one at Kurseong economically unviable. (c)  & (d)  There is no proposal for re-starting any of the closed printing presses. *******
