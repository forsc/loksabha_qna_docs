As per policy decision of University Grants Commission (UGC) and criteria notified in the Information Bulletin of UGC-NET, 6% of appeared candidates in both the papers of UGC-NET were declared qualified for December 2020 and June 2021 Cycles /terms together by National Testing Agency (NTA).(d) & (e): No. As per procedure and criteria for declaration of result, 6% of the appeared candidates in both the papers are declared qualified in each UGC-NET.   The online applications were invited for December 2020 Cycle UGC-NET in the month of February, 2021.  As a result of COVID-19 pandemic, the said examination could not be conducted as per schedule.  Since June 2021 Cycle of UGC-NET was also to be conducted, it was decided to conduct the exam for both these cycles together. Hence, once again the portal for inviting online applications for June, 2021 Cycle was opened in the month of August, 2021. The exam for both these cycles was conducted together and as per the criteria, 6% of appeared candidates of both these cycles were declared qualified.The qualifying criteria of UGC-NET being very scientific, the number of qualifying candidates increases automatically if the number of appearing candidates increases.*****
