(b) to (e):  The schemes under PMKSY and schemes under MIDH and NHB  are demand driven. A Statement indicating State-wise number of Cold Storage in Mega Food Parks approved under the scheme of Mega Food Parks is at Annexure-I. A Statement indicating State-wise number of Cold Storage capacities created under the scheme of Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition is at Annexure-II.
