ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Government of India (GoI) has formulated a Greenfield Airport Policy for development of Greenfield Airports across the country. In line with the Policy, GoI has granted ''in principle'' approval for setting up of 21 Greenfield Airports across the country namely Mopa in Goa, Navi Mumbai, Sindhudurg and Shirdi in Maharashtra, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Hassan and Shimoga in Karnataka, Kannur in Kerala, Durgapur in West Bengal, Datia in Gwalior, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kushinagar and Noida (Jewar) in Uttar Pradesh, Dholera and Hirasar in Gujarat, Karaikal in Puducherry, Dagadarthi, Bhogapuram and Oravakal in Andhra Pradesh and Holongi, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh. Four Greenfield Airports namely, Shirdi, Kannur, Durgapur and Pakyong have already been operationalized. GoI has also granted ''site clearance'' approval for setting up of 6 Greenfield Airports across the country namely Machiwara in Ludhiana, Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, Alwar (Bhiwadi) in Rajasthan, Kothagudem, Dist. Khammam in Telangana, Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh and Purandar in Pune. Besides, GoI had also granted site clearance to an airport company namely, M/s. Prakasam Airport Pvt. Ltd. for construction of a new Green field airport at Ongole in Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh. However, as the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) had scrapped the proposal of setting up of Greenfield airport near Ongole, the site clearance was withdrawn in October, 2016. (c) As per the Greenfield Airport Policy, the parameters for selection of a place for construction of new Greenfield airport include inter-alia, submission of proposal by the airport developer in the prescribed performa along with Techno Economic Feasibility Report (TEFR) & Detailed Project Report (DPR), availability of obstacle free land, necessary support from State Government, surface access through multi modal linkages, impact assessment on the nearby airports (if within 150 kms), necessary clearances from various Government agencies viz. Environment clearance, security clearance, no objection from the Defense, Airports Authority of India and Directorate General of Civil Aviation etc. (d) Government of India has not received any proposal from State Govt. of Bihar or any other Airport company for construction of new airport at Supaul in Bihar.
