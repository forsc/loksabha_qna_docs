Consequently, the existing rates in textile sector would continue beyond 1st January, 2022.(b):	In order to make textiles products cost competitive and adopting the principle of zero rated export, the Union Cabinet has given its approval on 14thJuly 2021 for continuation of Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) on exports of Apparel/Garments (Chapters-61 & 62) and Made-ups (Chapter-63) till 31stMarch 2024. The other textiles products (excluding Chapter 61, 62 and 63) which are not covered under the RoSCTL shall be eligible to avail the benefits, if any, under RoDTEP along with other products.(c):	Details of Textiles & Apparel exports during April-November, 2021 is as under:                                                                USD MillionApril 2021	3244May 2021	3061June 2021	3053July 2021	3571August 2021	3355September 2021	3417October 2021	3410November 2021	3229             Source: DGCIS Provisional data***
