ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (e) The estimated data available with the Ministry for PIOs and NRIs in different countries at present is placed in Annexure -I. The total number of NRIs in the given annexure includes students and migrant workforce. However, the Ministry maintains the data of Indian emigrants having ECR passports going for employment in the 18 ECR countries and this data is available with us as these workers migrate through the e-migrate system. Registration of overseas Indians with the Missions/Posts is voluntary and it has been the Government’s experience that despite constant encouragement, not all overseas Indians including students register with the Missions abroad, though the registration can be done online. Therefore, the Ministry and the Missions collate data from various sources and an estimate number of PIOs, NRIs and Indian students living in a country is arrived at. ***
