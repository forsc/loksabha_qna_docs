Banking companies classify loans and advances as non-performing assets (NPAs) and make provision for NPAs in their balance-sheet from their internal accruals in accordance with these instructions. Government does not provide financial aid for such provisioning. Further, no adjustment is made to the borrower’s liability to the banking company in respect of loan accounts for which the banking company has made provision.(b): Does not arise.*****
