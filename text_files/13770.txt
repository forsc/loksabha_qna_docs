                                                        ANSWER THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  As informed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),  Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) related to chronic kidney disease has increased by 12% between 1990 to 2016, as per the Global Burden of Disease – India Study. However, it is anticipated that with increase in cases of Diabetes & Hypertension as well as awareness about kidney diseases, more cases are getting reported in hospitals.  The ICMR conducted a prevalence study of CKD in the Indian population with centres at Delhi, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Guwahati and Mumbai.  The initial trends of data indicates a community prevalence of CKD on first screening ranging from 5.5% - 18.2% with an average prevalence of 11.4% on first screening.Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP), State Governments are supported for providing dialysis services free of cost to the poor under the Umbrella of the NHM.  Such support is based on the proposals received from States in their annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). A total of 474 Districts have been covered with 824 Centres having 5014 machines with a combined capacity of performing approximately 62.88 Lakhs Haemodialysis Sessions under PMNDP. Guidelines for establishing peritoneal dialysis  services under PMNDP have also been issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and all the States/UTs including Jharkhand have been requested to sent proposals for peritoneal dialysis in their Project Implementation Plan (PIPs).
