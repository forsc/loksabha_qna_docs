ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Sir, pricing of air tickets is decided by the airlines based on market dynamics and inventory management process. Airlines offer fares at various levels, which are driven by market forces. The airfares increase with the increase in demand as the lower fare buckets get sold out first. This is a global practice followed  in the aviation industry. With the repeal of the Air Corporations Act in March 1994, the tariff fixation has been deregulated and airlines are free to fix reasonable tariffs under the provisions of sub-rule (1) of rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Every Air Transport Undertaking establishes air tariff  having regard to all relevant factors, including the cost of operation, characteristics of services, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. Airlines are required to maintain transparency in this regard under sub-rule (2) of rule 135 and the fare charged by them should not exceed the fare established and displayed on their website.Therefore, no action is called for on the part of the Government  in this regard.;;(c) & (d): A number of requests have been received from time to time with regard to regulation of air fare on Gulf-Kerala Sector. As given above, the airlines must fix air fares as per rule 135(1) of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 taking into consideration  relevant factors, like the cost of operation, characteristics of services, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. Since the system of fare baskets has been adopted by the airlines, the passengers who book their tickets first get lower fares and the late comers have to go for higher fares. To facilitate the passengers'' movement, the Ministry had temporarily allocated the rights of Jet Airways to other airlines even on international sectors including India-Gulf sector.
