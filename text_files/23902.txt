ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                             (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	 to (d): Yes, Sir. The Ease of Living Index 2020 was released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on 4 March 2021. The index evaluates 111 Indian cities on three pillars: Quality of Life, Economic Ability, and Sustainability, which have a weightage of 70%. A Citizen Perception Survey, which has a weightage of 30% had been conducted by the Ministry to incorporate the views of the citizens in these cities. The parameters under the three pillars are:•	Quality of Life: Education, Health, Housing and Shelter, Water Supply, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) and Solid Waste Management (SWM), Mobility, Safety and Security, and Recreation. •	Economic Ability: Level of Economic Development and Economic Opportunities. •	Sustainability: Environment, Green Space and Buildings, Energy Consumption, and City Resilience. The Ease of Living Index 2020 report has been made available to the States. It apprises and guides them on actions needed to achieve broader developmental outcomes including the Sustainable Development Goals, generate information to guide evidence-based policy-making, assess and compare the outcomes achieved from various urban policies and schemes, and obtain the perception of citizens about their view on the services provided by city administrations.National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) was constituted under the NCRPB Act, 1985 with key rationale for preparation of plan for development of NCR coordination, monitoring and implementation of Regional Plan and to evolve harmonized policies for land-use control with aim for holistic development of infrastructure, avoidance of haphazard development & connected matters thereto. Accordingly, Regional Plan-2001 (RP-2001) and Regional Plan-2021 (RP-2021) for National Capital Region (NCR) has been prepared by NCRPB, as mandated by the NCRPB Act, 1985. The National Capital Region has grown gradually from about 34,144 sq. km. in 2005 to about 55,083 sq. km. now.  NCR is a huge and diverse region with NCT of Delhi as a core and adjoining districts across States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. NCRPB is a unique example of participative decision making with cross-cutting, multi-sectoral regional planning and initiatives. The current and past Regional Plans have led to transformative interventions, inter alia, such as Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), etc.                                                     *****
