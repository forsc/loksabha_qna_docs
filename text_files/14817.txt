                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR CULTURE AND TOURISM(PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)to(c)	A statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.303 FOR 16.3.2020(a)to(c)	There is no such proposal to convert any centrally protected monument as earning centre.  However, regular conservation, preservation and annual maintenance are taken up beside environmental upgradation and providing facilities like drinking water, toilet, benches, ramps, wheel chairs, signages (including Braille), illumination, sound & light shows, cafeteria, publication sale counter, etc.  Further, at potential monuments, museums have been developed.  Sound and Light show is functioning at Shaniwar Wada,Pune. The Muktabai Temple at Muktawadi is not a centrally protected monument. Archaeological Survey of India undertakes special conservation and preservation of about 600-700 monuments every year based on priority, site requirement and budget allocation besides annual maintenance and minor repairs to all protected monument.  Shaniwar Wada at Pune is in a  fair state of conservation.  Expenditure incurred on conservation, preservation and annual maintenance of all centrally protected monuments all over the country is as under:         Rupees (in lakhs) 2016-17	30129.372017-18	41076.792018-19	40502.012019-20	43560.68 (Provision)Since there is no proposal to convert any monument as earning centre, question of intended development does not arise.  However, providing tourist facilities and up-grading them from time to time is a continuous phenomenon.
