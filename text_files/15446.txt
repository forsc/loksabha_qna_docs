                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	As per available information, 337 Indian prisoners, including fishermen, are believed to be in Pakistan''s custody. However, as per the lists exchanged between the Governments of India and Pakistan on 1 January 2020, Pakistan has acknowledged the custody of 261 Indian prisoners, including fishermen, in its custody. According to available information, the time since they are believed to be in Pakistan’s custody is as below:<pre>Less than 5 yearsMore than 5 years but less than 10 yearsMore than  10 years but less than 15 yearsMore than 15 yearsNumber of Civilian Prisoners34191103Number of Fishermen270---</pre>	In addition, there is the issue of 83 missing Indian defence personnel, including Prisoners of war, whose custody has not been acknowledged by Pakistan, so far. 	The Government consistently pursues the case of early release and repatriation of the Indian nationals languishing in Pakistan jails. In addition, the High Commission of India in Islamabad, on a continuing basis, provides humanitarian and legal assistance to Indian nationals imprisoned in Pakistan, including regular distribution of items of daily necessity to them through Pakistan jail authorities.(c) 	As per available information, 270 Indian fishermen are believed to be in Pakistan''s custody. However, Pakistan has, so far acknowledged the custody of 207 only. The Government, upon receipt of reports of apprehension of the Indian fishermen, immediately takes up the matter with Pakistan through diplomatic channels and seeks immediate consular access as well as their early release and repatriation, along with fishing boats. As a result of persistent efforts, the Government has been successful in securing the release and repatriation of 2,100 Indian fishermen, from Pakistan''s custody since 2014, so far.***
