Details of such important studies of the last 10 years are given in Annexure-A.(b):    The Ministry of AYUSH actively promotes various activities of Yoga in the country through its autonomous bodies namely (MDNIY), New Delhi, National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN), Pune, Central Council of Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), New Delhi. The details of which are placed at Annexure-B.In addition, an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which steps are taken to reach out to people to promote Yoga and Naturopathy. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. Also, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM), financial assistance is provided to States and Union Territories for setting up AYUSH Wellness Centres including Yoga.However, Ministry of AYUSH does not make State/UT-wise budgetary allocation for the same.(c):     The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 has recommended Health and Physical Education as a compulsory subject from Class I to X. Yoga has been made an integral part of Health and Physical Education.  The NCF states that “Yoga may be introduced from the primary level onward in informal way, but formal introduction of yoga from class VI onward”. Since, as Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, the appointment of Yoga teachers is mainly comes in the purview of State/UT Governments.

At the Central level, Ministry of AYUSH also strives to promote these systems and to create awareness for the benefit of the people. Ministry of AYUSH through its three autonomous bodies namely Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY) and National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN) promote activities related to Yoga and Naturopathy.
