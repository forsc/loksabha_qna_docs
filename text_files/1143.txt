Central Water Commission compiles the details of annual damage due to the floods as per information provided  by the State Governments. These data are available from year 1953 onwards. The State–wise average damages for Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal for the period from 1953 to 2017 is at Annexure I.(c) & (d)  Currently, the Flood Forecasting & Early Warning System of rivers flowing from Nepal to India is in place. Government of India is having continuous dialogue with the Government of Nepal at various levels to mitigate devastation caused by the flood havoc from the rivers coming from Nepal through various storage dams like Panchswar multipurpose project, Saptakosi-Sun Kosi project etc., contemplated jointly by both the Governments. Government of  India has been regularly taking up this matter with the Government of Nepal through various bilateral mechanisms in the sector of water resources such as the Joint Committee on Inundation and Flood Management as well as the Joint Committee on Kosi and Gandak Projects. Government has been cooperating continuously with the Government of Nepal in the areas of flood forecasting and hydro meteorological data sharing.	*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.†1075 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.06.2019 REGARDING “LOSS DUE TO FLOODS”Statement showing the average damages due to floods in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal during the period 1953 to 2017Sl.
