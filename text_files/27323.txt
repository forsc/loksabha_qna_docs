ANSWER




                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) and (b):Yes Sir. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched on 25 June 2015 in selected 500 cities and towns across the country. The Mission focuses on development of basic infrastructure in the AMRUT cities and towns in the thrust areas of water supply; sewerage and septage management; storm water drainage; green spaces and parks; and non-motorized urban transport. 	In order to assess the gap between number of households having water tap/sewerage connections and those not having these facilities, Service Level Improvement Plans (SLIPs) were prepared on the basis of Census-2011 data by each Urban Local Body (ULB) of AMRUT cities/towns.  Once the service level gaps were computed, plans to bridge the gap through infrastructure development were prepared by each State /UT in the form of State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs). 	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has approved SAAPs of all the States/Union Territories (UTs) amounting to Rs.77,640 crore for the entire Mission period, which includes committed Central Assistance (CA) of Rs.35,990 crore, of which 3,629 projects worth Rs.19,568 crore have been completed, contracts have been awarded for 2,116 projects worth Rs.60,672 crore and projects are at various stages of implementation and 155 projects worth Rs.1,046 crore are under tendering. Further, overall works worth around Rs.52,000 crore have been physically completed so far.  Some of the States/UTs have taken projects in excess of approved SAAP sizes. The entire excess expenditure will be borne by the concerned States/UTs themselves.	The implementation of AMRUT projects so far have achieved the following development goals:(i)	Against the assessed gap of 139 lakh water tap connections, around 107 lakh connections and against the target of 145 sewer/ septage connections, 79 lakh connections have been provided, so far under AMRUT or in convergence with other schemes.(ii)	Around 1,600 MLD (million litre per day) capacity has been created and works to develop additional 4,400 MLD of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are under progress.(iii)	Through Storm Water Drainage projects, around 1,845 water-logging points have been eliminated and another 1,005 points will be eliminated on the completion of projects under implementation.(iv)	Around 3,800 acres of permeable green space has been developed through Green Spaces and Parks projects and another 1,600 acres of area is under development.(v)	Around 350 projects worth Rs.1,085 crore have been taken up to promote green mobility through well designed pedestrian footpath, walkways, foot-over bridges (specially in hilly regions), pedestrian underpass, and parking stands etc.(c):	The number of water bodies taken up for rejuvenation through AMRUT projects in last 3 years and current year are given as under:State	             Number of water bodies taken up for rejuvenation          2018-19	 2019-20	2020-21	       2021-22Bihar	      -	             1	           -	         -Jharkhand    21	             -	           -	         -Kerala	      6	             2	           -	         -West Bengal   8	             -	           -	         -Total	     35	             3	           0	         0                                              *****
