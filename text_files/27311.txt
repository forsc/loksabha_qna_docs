                                                                THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a): Yes, Sir. In the budget speech of 2021 Hon’ble Finance Minister has announced about construction of Nashik Metro project at a cost of Rs.2,092 crore. (b) No, Sir.(c): The details of the budgetary provisions made in Financial Year 2020-21 for implementation of all Metro projects/ Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) projects in the country are as under:                                      (Rs.

Before DPIIT conveyed their decision in the matter, Collector, Mumbai Suburbs, transferred 102 acres land at village Kanjur, Taluka Kurla, Mumbai Suburban District to MMRDA vide order dated 01-10-2020 for the purposes of carrying out development work related to Metro Car Shed. The matter was taken up by DPIIT with Government of Maharashtra (GoM) on 15.10.2020 with a request to restrain MMRDA from taking any further steps and withdraw the order passed in this regard in order to protect the interests of Government of India (GoI). Due to non-response from GoM, DPIIT has challenged the order dated 01-10-2020 of Collector, Mumbai Suburbs by filing Writ Petition No. 5983/2020 before Bombay High Court. At present, the matter is sub-judice.                                        *****
