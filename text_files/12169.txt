                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (b):	As per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the estimated cases of Type-I diabetes in India in the age group of 0-19 years were  1,71,281 and  the total number of diabetics in the age group   20-79 years was  77.0 million, in the year 2019. As per IDF, India is not amongst the top ten countries for the incidence rate (per lakh population per annum) of type I diabetes in children (aged 0-14 years). The Government of India with the support from UNICEF has conducted the first ever Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) during the year 2016 to 2018 in 30 States.  As per survey report, the prevalence of diabetes was low among both children (1.2%) and adolescents (0.7%). (c) & (d):	The treatment in Government Hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Under National Health Mission, essential drugs and diagnostics are provided free of cost in public health facilities.  Further, quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under ‘Jan Aushadhi Scheme’, in collaboration with the State Governments. Also, 195 AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment) stores have been set up in hospitals, where essential life-saving medicines including for diabetes are being provided at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price.Public health and hospitals is a state subject. The Central Government however supplements the efforts of the State Governments. National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) including diabetes, 616 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,827 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS. Treatment for diabetes is also available at other health facilities run by the Central and State Governments. A population level initiative of prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary health care. Under this initiative, frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists(ASHA) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives(ANM), inter alia, are leveraged to carry out screening and generate awareness about the risk factors of NCDs including diabetes among the masses. The initiative is under implementation in over 215 districts across the country. Screening for common NCDs including diabetes is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres.
