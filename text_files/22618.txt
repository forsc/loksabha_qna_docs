ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b):  Three new greenfield airports namely, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kannur in Kerala and Kalaburagi in Karnataka have been made functional during the last three years. Further, 56 Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik)  airports including 5 heliports, 2 water aerodromes and the above three greenfield airports have been operationalized for operating RCS flights across the country. Out of 56 RCS airports, 37 number of RCS airports are unserved airports and commercial operations have started, for the first time in these airports. State-wise list of these airports is at Annexure. Approximately 60 lakh passengers have travelled through RCS flights so far.(c) & (d): Government of India has granted ''in principle'' approval to Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) for setting up of a new greenfield international airport at Jewar, Noida on 08.05.2018. State Government has awarded the project to M/s Zurich Airports International for development of the airport under Public Private Partnership (PPP). Probable Date of Completion (PDC) of Phase-I of the airport development is in 2023-24. ;As regards development of Deoghar airport in Jharkhand, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has undertaken the work of development of Deogarh airport to make it suitable for operation of Code 3C VFR (ATR 72) type of aircraft. The Probable Date of Completion (PDC) is June 2021 subject to obligations to be fulfilled by the State Government. However, the timeline for completion of airport project depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatory clearances, financial closure by the individual operator etc.
