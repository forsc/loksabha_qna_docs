ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)  and (b): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) AND (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3624 BY  SHRI KURUVA GORANTLA MADHAV TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2021  REGARDING  YELAHANKA TO PENUKONDA DOUBLING RAILWAY LINE(a) and (b): Yelahanka - Penukonda (120 km) doubling project was included in the Budget 2015-16. Anticipated cost of the project is `1,147 crore. So far, 72 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `912 crore has been incurred on the project. An outlay of `160 crore has been proposed in the Budget 2021-22.  	Project falls in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh State. Government of Andhra Pradesh in April, 2015 has consented to share 50% cost of the project falling in the jurisdiction of Andhra Pradesh and accordingly `50 crore was deposited by them in 2016-17 against their share of `200 crore. Further Government of Andhra Pradesh has not released balance funds despite several reminders. Finally in 2019-20, Government of Andhra Pradesh stated that the State Government will no longer be able to share the cost of this doubling and electrification projects in view of limited financial resources of the State Government. The change in the policy of Government of Andhra Pradesh is severely affecting the execution of projects in Andhra Pradesh which have been taken up through cost sharing.  Since, Government of Andhra Pradesh has shown inability to continue with further cost sharing of the project, therefore Ministry of Railways has now decided to execute this capacity enhancement doubling project by its own funding. Average annual budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh, during 2014-19 has increased to `2,830 crore per year from `886 crore per year (during 2009-14) i.e. an increase of 219%.  Budget allotment for these projects for financial year 2019-20 was `3,885 crore, which is 338% more w.r.t. 2009-14. Budget allocation of `4,910 crore has been provided for Financial Year 2020-21, which is 454% more with respect to average Budget outlay for 2009-14. Budget allocation (proposed) has further increased to `5,812 crore in financial year 2021-22 (556% more with respect to average of 2009-14).During 2009-14, 363 Km project length (81 Km New line, 144 Km Gauge Conversion and 138 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh was commissioned at an average rate of 72.6 km per year.  During 2014-19, 377 Km project length (258 Km New Line and 119 Km Doubling projects) falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh have been commissioned at an average rate 75.3 Km per year against 72.6 km/year for 2009-14. In 2019-20, 207 Km project length (60 Km New Line and 147 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh have been commissioned, which is 185% more than average commissioning during 2009-14.*****
