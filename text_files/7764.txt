ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) & (b) The ongoing Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) is an initiative to undertake continuous improvement across selected sectors viz. Health & Nutrition, School Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Skill Development & Financial Inclusion and Basic Infrastructure. The progress is mapped every month by capturing improvement in key performance indicators in these sectors. A copy of list of indicators, catalogued in a Primer is placed at http://championsofchange.gov.in/publications. As the Programme strives for continuous improvement, no specific agenda for 100 days has been set for this initiative. (c)&(d): A key strategy of the ADP is to monitor the progress in the Programme at different level on regular basis. As such, Government of India has appointed Central Prabhari Officers for each district whose function is to assist the district and State administration in transforming these districts and to review the performance on continuous basis. The monthly progress in selected performance indicators are captured in a web portal championsofchange.gov.in which is available in public domain. This facilitates the review by officials at different levels including District and State Government level and Government of India. In addition, an Empowered Committee of Secretaries has been constituted for ADP. The function of this Committee inter alia is to review progress in Aspirational districts on regular basis. Niti Aayog has also requested State Governments to monitor the progress in this Programme at appropriate level regularly.   (e) The on-going ADP is in the nature of an additional initiative under which convergence among the existing Schemes of Central and State Governments is being done. As such the Programme does not replace any existing Scheme of Central or State Government and hence is in the nature of additionality. Under the Programme, the District Administrations have been encouraged to draft a District action plan by taking into account existing schemes of Central and State Government and implement the same subject to availability of resources under different on-going schemes. (f) As stated in (c) & (d) above, progress of a district across different indicators under focus in this Programme is captured regularly on championsofchange.gov.in. On the basis of information provided by the District Administration, Chatra has made an overall average progress of 18% [in the 49 key performance indicators taken under the Programme pertaining to the sectors under focus as mentioned in answer (a) & (b) above in this Programme since March 2018 till September 2019 while districts of Latehar and Palamu have made average progress of 31% and 32%, respectively.           ***
