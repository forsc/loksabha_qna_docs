                                                        ANSWER:-       MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY) (a)	 The opium cultivation in the country is carried out as per United Nations conventions on drug matters and NDPS Act 1985 for the purpose of medical use of opium and alkaloids present in it. Earlier opium gum produced by farmers was used for extraction of alkaloids for domestic use as well as for export to various countries. However, now importing countries are fulfilling their medical requirement through extracting of alkaloids from Concentrate of Poppy Straw (CPS) instead of opium gum. Therefore, at present opium is produced in our country for extraction of alkaloids for domestic use only, which has led to less requirement of opium gum. Since opium gum can be produced as per requirement only therefore area under cultivation varies every year. The State-wise details of area (in hectare) for opium farming in the country during the last ten years is at Annexure I.(b)	& (c) :-  Opium Cultivation as per international convention and NDPS Act 1985 is carried out to obtain alkaloids particularly Morphine, for medical purpose. Accordingly criteria of issuing license for cultivation of opium has been changed to Morphine content present in the Opium tendered by the farmer. The amount of Morphine is scientifically measured through machines and having minimal human interference. It also takes care of both quality and quantity issue of opium tendered by farmer. On the contrary, an average basis criterion which was used earlier, measures opium in terms of its weight only as minimum qualifying yield (MQY) for licensing. However, it requires more human interference and was comparatively less scientific. Since the present method is more scientific, has led to improvement in quality of opium tendered and has also led to reduction in number of farmers disqualified for not meeting the criteria of minimum qualifying yield, Government intends to continue with the present system.     (d)   The details are at Annexure II.***** ANNEXURE  ISl.
