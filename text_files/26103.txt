STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION *171 TO BEANSWERED ON 30/07/2021 REGARDING ‘GENOME SEQUENCING OF NEWVARIANT OF CORONAVIRUS’(a) The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSCOG) a consortium of 28 genomesequencing laboratories of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science andTechnology (DST), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHF&W), Council of Scientificand Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Education, Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and State Governments was established as an Inter-Ministerial initiative with an overallobjective to expand whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the nation, aiding ourunderstanding of how the virus spreads and evolves. The specific objectives of INSACOG are; i)ascertain the current status of new variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the country; ii) establish a sentinelsurveillance for early detection of genomic variants with public health implication; iii) determinethe genomic variants in the unusual events/trends (super-spreader events, high mortality /morbidity trend areas etc.).Since the inception of INSACOG till now the INSACOG has sequenced 58,240 SARS-CoV-2genomes. Out of these 46,124 samples have been analyzed and assigned Pangolin lineageclassification and submitted to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for public healthcorrelation.(b), (c), and (d) No, genome sequencing capacity has not been reduced in the country. The capacityhas enhanced by expanding INSACOG network from 10 laboratories to 28 laboratories. Efforts interms of expansion of INSACOG by onboarding more laboratories have been undertaken. StandardOperating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed to accelerate the pace of genome sequencingin terms of the number of samples to be sequenced as well as the time for reporting and undertakesequencing of samples from hospitals and for sewerage surveillance as a public health tool tounderstand COVID-19 spread in a community. These initiatives provide significant scientificinformation to assist and guide the public health decisions for COVID-19 management in thecountry.****
