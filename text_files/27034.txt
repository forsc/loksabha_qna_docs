ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	A Fast Patrol Vessel (FPV) was handed over by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India to the President of Seychelles for the use of the Seychelles Coast Guard during a High Level India-Seychelles Virtual Event on 08 April 2021. The FPV, built by M/s GRSE, Kolkata at a cost of INR 100 crore, has been gifted to Seychelles under Indian grant assistance to meet its urgent requirement of strengthening its maritime surveillance capabilities. 		India’s policy towards countries in the Indian Ocean Region is guided by the ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and Prime Minister’s vision of SAGAR (Security & Growth for all in the Region). The vision of SAGAR underscores India’s sustained engagement in the Indian Ocean region which includes inter-alia deepening economic and security cooperation in the littoral; working towards sustainable regional development through enhanced collaboration; promoting collective action to deal with natural disasters and maritime threats like piracy, terrorism and emergent non-state actors;  and engaging with countries in the region with the aim of building greater trust and promoting respect for maritime rules, norms and peaceful resolution of disputes.(b)      In the last three years, one Fast Patrol Vessel (FPV) was gifted to Maldives in 2019.***
