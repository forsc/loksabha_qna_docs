ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)to(c): This Ministry has recently received a communication from State Government of Bihar with a request to interlink the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) with Agriculture sector. The Government has conveyed to the State Government that under the provision of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, 2005, all agriculture activities may not be permitted. However, a large number of durable agri and allied activities covering a very large spectrum are permissible under the Scheme which are helping agriculture sector and farmers and providing livelihood opportunities to the beneficiaries against their demand.	Mahatma Gandhi NREGS lays emphasis that at least 60% of works at district level in terms of cost shall be for creation of productive assets directly linked to Agriculture and Allied Activities which include works related to water security like construction of farm ponds, wells, earthen check dam, field channels and other water harvesting structures. The Act provides that works which are non-tangible, not measurable and repetitive such as removing grass, pebbles and agricultural operations shall not be taken up. The percentage of expenditure on Agriculture & Agriculture allied works under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the FY 2017-18, FY 2018-19, 2019-20 and current FY 2020-21 has been 66.07%, 63.39%, 65.91% and 66.96% respectively, which is higher than 60%.  ********
