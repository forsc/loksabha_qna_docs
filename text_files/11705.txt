ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	The matter of reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), including expansion of its membership, has been pending for several years. India in collaboration with other pro-reform countries has been consistently making efforts to build support among the UN Member States for early reform and expansion of the UNSC, in both permanent and non-permanent categories of its membership in order to reflect contemporary geo-political realities.(b) & (c)	Government of India has accorded the highest priority to getting permanent membership for India in an expanded UNSC. A series of initiatives involving bilateral and multilateral engagements have been undertaken by the Government towards this objective. India is actively engaged in the ongoing Inter-Governmental Negotiations on UNSC reform at the UN. India is working alongside other reform-oriented countries through its membership of the G-4 Group (India, Japan, Brazil and Germany) and the L.69 Group (cross-regional grouping of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America). As a result of India’s sustained efforts, a large number of countries have supported India’s candidature for permanent membership in an expanded UNSC.
