ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a) to (c): The comparative data of NFHS- 5 and NFHS- 4 shows that child marriage is on decline in the State of Andhra Pradesh.  Further, the data maintained by Ministry of Education shows a decline in the drop-out rate among girls in the State of Andhra Pradesh at secondary school level between 2017-18 and 2018-19. The reasons for out of school children, including drop-outs may be influenced by various factors such as poverty/ economic reason, child suffering from poor health, child too young to be attending school, child needed to help in domestic work etc. (d): The Government has enacted the ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006’ which prohibits the marriage of a girl below 18 years of age and prescribes penal provisions for those solemnising, promoting or permitting such marriages. The Government also undertakes awareness drives, media campaigns and outreach programmes and issues advisories to the States/ UTs from time to time to highlight the evil effects of this practice. Further, the Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the schemes of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)’ in which creation of awareness on matters pertaining to gender equality and discouraging of child marriage is an important focus area. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also undertakes awareness programmes and consultations with stakeholders from time to time in this regard.  *****
