This will result in higher production and productivity and expansion of direct and indirect employment opportunities. 	While deciding the terms and conditions of the strategic sale, legitimate concerns of the existing employees and other stakeholders are suitably addressed through appropriate provisions made in the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA).  	(d)-(e): The State Government does not have any equity in RINL. However, the State Government is consulted in specific matters as and when needed and their support is also solicited in the matters that require their intervention.  *****
