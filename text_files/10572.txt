                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has any proposal to increase the metro rail network to connect National Capital Region (NCR) in more extensive way in near future;(b) 	if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; and(c) 	the details of implementation procedure for any such proposal in near future? 






ANSWER




(a) to (c):	 Urban transport is an integral part of urban development, which is a state subject. Respective state governments are, therefore, responsible for initiating and developing urban transport infrastructure, including metro rail projects in cities or urban agglomerates. The Central Government considers financial assistance for such proposals on the basis of the feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned state governments. Option for central financial assistance and mode of implementation viz. Public Private Partnership (PPP), Grant by Central Government and Equity Sharing Model etc, as stipulated in Metro Rail Policy-2017 is decided by the concerned state government. 	At present about 389 km of metro rail line is operational in National Capital Region (NCR).  During last five years, about 123 km of metro rail line and 82 km of Regional Rapid Transit System has been approved for NCR.                                  *****
