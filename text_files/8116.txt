                                                        (a)	& (b): As per Census 2011, homeless population in the country is 17,73,040 and in Maharashtra population of homeless is 2,10,908. Registrar General of India (RGI) has reported that data on landless people is not collected in Census. Also, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) does not maintain any data on landless people. (c): In pursuance to Government of India’s vision of facilitating Housing for All by 2022, the MoHUA has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June, 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/Union Territories (UTs)/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for providing all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructure to all eligible urban households. PMAY-U Mission envisages Government’s intervention through the following four verticals namely “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), Affordable Housing in Partnership with public or private sector (AHP) and Beneficiary-led individual house construction/enhancement (BLC).The landless households may opt for AHP vertical under the Mission where houses are provided in multi-storey houses. Secondly, landless persons may also apply for interest subsidy under CLSS component and purchase the house available in the open market.Under PMAY-U Mission, 93 lakh houses have been sanctioned so far against the demand of 112 lakh houses. Out of 93 lakh sanctioned houses, 55.40 lakh houses are grounded for construction and construction of 28.06 lakh houses have been completed.                               *****
