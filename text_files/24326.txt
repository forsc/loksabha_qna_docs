Apart from this, Railway Childlines at major railway platforms are also being operated to provide assistance to any needy child. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has also developed a national tracking system for missing and vulnerable children namely TrackChild portal, which has been implemented across the country. It also launched the ‘Khoya-Paya’ portal in 2015, which is an enabling platform, where citizens can report missing children as well as sightings of their whereabouts without losing much time.*****
