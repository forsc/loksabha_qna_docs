However there are still pockets of low coverage.  The reasons for low immunization coverage identified are: (i) lack of awareness of benefit of Immunization, (ii) apprehensions of Adverse Effect Following Immunization (AEFI), (iii) travelling of children, (iv) refusal for vaccination and (v) operational gaps.  To mitigate the identified reasons of low immunization coverage, strategic interventions like advocacy, social mobilization, community engagement, inter personal communication at family level and media engagement are undertaken.Hence, special vaccination drives like Mission Indradhanush, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan (GSA), Extended GSA have been carried out to reach the left out and drop out children from vaccination. The State/UT-wise percentage of immunization coverage is placed at Annexure 1. (c) & (d):	Yes, the State/Union Territory wise details of deaths due to Vaccine preventable diseases are placed at Annexure 2.
