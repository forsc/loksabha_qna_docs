(a) Anganwadi Services (Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented by States/UTs with the following objectives:-i.	To improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group of 0-6 years;ii.	To lay the foundation for proper psychological, physical and social development of the child;iii.	To reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and school dropouts;iv.	To achieve effective co-ordination of policy and implementation amongst the various departments to promote child development; andv.	To enhance the capability of the mother to look after the normal health and nutritional needs of the child through proper nutrition and health education.Under Anganwadi Services, a package of six services, namely, (i) Supplementary Nutrition; (ii) Pre-school Non-formal Education; (iii) Nutrition & Health Education; (iv) Immunization; (v) Health Check-up; and (vi) Referral Services has been provided to all eligible beneficiaries, namely, children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers through the platform of Anganwadi Centres across the country. Three of the services viz. Imunization, Health Check-up and Referral Services are related to health and are provided through NRHM & Public Health Infrastructure. Challenges including filling up of vacancies of Anganwadi Services functionaries, issues around anganwadi infrastructure, smooth delivery of services to beneficiaries etc have been addressed during the implementation of the Scheme through sustained engagements with States.  (b)  In order to strengthen processes for community engagement, empowerment of beneficiaries and increased social accountability of ICDS, the POSHAN Abhiyaan provides for the organization of Community Based Events (CBEs) twice in a month on a fixed day of week by each Anganwadi Centre. Under Community Based Events, Annaprasan Diwas, Suposan Diwas (specifically focused on orienting husbands), Celebrating coming of age- getting ready for pre-school at AWC, Messages related to public health for improvement of nutrition and to reduce illness are covered. Approx. 3.70 crore CBEs have been conducted so far.Nutrition-centric annual Jan Andolans like Poshan Maah and Poshan Pakhwada helped reaching out to the people.
