ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	In its Citizens’ Charter, the Ministry is committed to issue a fresh passport in ‘Normal’ Category within 30 working days (excluding PV). In case of re-issue of an ordinary passport, the Ministry is committed to issue it within 7 working days in cases where pre-police verification is not required and within 30 working days (excluding PV) in cases where PV is required. 	The average time taken to issue a passport during January-May 2019 by Passport Office (PO), Ahmedabad, is 10 days (excluding PV) in ‘Normal’ Category and 2 days in ‘Tatkaal’ Category. The average time taken to issue a passport by PO, Surat, during the same period is 12 days (excluding PV) in ‘Normal’ Category and 1 day in ‘Tatkaal’ Category. 	Thus, while there is no delay in issuing fresh passports or re-issue of passports in Gujarat, at times, the process of issuance of passports get might delayed due to the following reasons:i.	Late receipt of police verification reports;ii.	Receipt of incomplete police reports; andiii.	Late submission of requisite documents by the applicants.(c)	 During the previous year 2018, the total number of applications received for passports in Gujarat were 8,83,560 out of which, services were rendered for 8,67,081 applications. During the period January-May 2019, the total number of applications received for passports in Gujarat were 3,41,472 against which services were rendered for 3,52,183 applications. The number of applications processed in 2019 is higher than the number of applications during this period since some of the applications received in 2018 were processed in 2019.  There are two Passport Offices in Gujarat at Ahmedabad and Surat. The district-wise number of passport applications received at the Passport Seva Kendras under these two Passport Offices during 2018 and during the period January-May, 2019 is at Annexure-I.(d)	The district-wise pending passport applications submitted in the two Passport Offices at Ahmedabad and Surat till 31 May, 2019, is at Annexure-II.(e)	In order to clear the pending files, the Passport Offices in Gujarat have taken several steps. The Passport Offices have expedited the printing and dispatch processes for the passports. Passports Adalats are being organized at regular intervals for the benefit of the applicants who have also been requested to provide the documents in the absence of which the passport applications could not be further processed. At the same time, the Police are being urged to expedite the PV process of the applicants so that the passports could be issued at the earliest.***
