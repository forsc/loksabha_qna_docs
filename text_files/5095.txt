                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): Details of the disinvestment targets and receipts during the last five years i.e. 2014-15 to 2018-19 are as follows:(In Rs. Crore)S. No.	Financial Year	Disinvestment Target	Proceeds from Disinvestment     	Budget Estimate	Revised Estimate	1.	2014-15	43,425	26,353	24,3492.	2015-16	69,500	25,313	23,9973.	2016-17	56,500	45,500	46,2474.	2017-18	72,500	1,00,000	1,00,0575.	2018-19	80,000	80,000	84,972The Budget Estimate for disinvestment during 2019-20 has been set at Rs. 1,05,000 crore.(b) & (c): Disinvestment of the CPSEs is undertaken through an open competitive bidding process so that best price is realized for Government of India stake. During the last two years, strategic disinvestment of 5 CPSEs (HPCL, REC, NPCC, HSCC and DCIL) has been successfully completed.  Profitability is not a criterion for strategic disinvestment. (d): The Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 23 CPSEs including subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures with sale of majority stake of Government of India and transfer of management control (the list is at Annex). Strategic disinvestment has been guided by the basic economic principle that the Government should not be in the business to engage itself in manufacturing/producing goods and services in sectors where competitive markets have come of age, and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of the strategic investors due to various factors, e.g. infusion of capital, technology up-gradation and efficient management practices. In addition, the Government would also be able to monetize its investment in CPSEs.The proceeds from strategic sale will depend on various factors, including prevailing market conditions, at the time of actual sale. ***** AnnexAnnex as referred to in reply to parts (b) to (d) of the Lok Sabha USQ No. 4657 to be answered on 22.7.2019.CPSEs, including Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures for which Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment.1.
