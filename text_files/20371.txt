                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) had identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Under the Peninsular Component of National Perspective Plan, three link projects have been planned for benefitting the state of Tamil Nadu; i) Pennar-Palar-Cauvery link project ii) Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link project and iii) Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar link project. NWDA has completed FR’s of the above three links and has sent to conserned State Governments. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) to Cauvery-Vaigai-Gunder link project has also been completed by NWDA and sent to the concerned State Governments.(b) to (e)  Works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as scheme for Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies (WB) etc. under PMKSY. No proposal regarding renovation of Velliyenai, Panjapatti and Thalavapalayam lakes has been received from the Government of Tamil Nadu under RRR of WBs scheme. 	As regards the interlinking of Amaravthi, Shanmughanadhi and Kudaganaru rivers, it is not part of the Interlinking of Rivers programme of NPP. Further, no request to study the said proposal has been received by NWDA from Government of Tamil Nadu.*****
