ANSWER




                                                        (a)   Steps taken by the Government to ensure maintenance of public toilets in urban areas are:(i). Government has introduced Open Defecation Free Plus (ODF+) protocol with a focus on sustaining ODF outcomes. The ODF+ protocol focuses on Operation & Maintenance (O&M) of community / public toilets (CT/PTs) by ensuring functionality and proper maintenance of CT/PTs for their continued usage. Till date, 755 cities have been certified ODF+. (ii)  Government has also introduced Open Defecation Free Plus Plus (ODF++) protocol with a focus on achieving holistic sanitation. The ODF++ protocol focuses on addressing safe management (collection, transportation & processing) of fecal sludge from toilets, and ensuring that no untreated sludge is discharged into open drains, water bodies or in the open. Till date, 299 cities have been certified ODF++. (iii) Government has also launched multimedia campaigns for IEC and behavior change with the theme of “Swachh Shouchalaya” to promote responsible usage of public toilets. (iv) Government, in partnership with Google, is currently uploading all public toilets on Google maps (by the name of “Google Toilet Locator”) under the heading "SBM Toilets" for ease of access of citizens to the public toilets. To get the feedback of the citizens on the O&M of the public toilets, a dashboard has been launched to analyse the responses of the users and their feedback. Till now 57,000+ toilet blocks from 2300+ cities have been uploaded on Google maps. (b)  As per Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SWM-U) Guidelines, Bio-toilets (or Bio-digester toilets), is one of the recommended technological options for construction of Individual Household Toilet (IHHT), Public Toilet or Community Toilet (CT).                                *****
