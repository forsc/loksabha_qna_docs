The year-wise and State-wise details are at Annexure-I. Depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government implements following  schemes under PPP mode for creation of storage facilities for Central Pool Stocks in the country:-(i)	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) SchemeUnder this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). No funds are allocated by Government and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. After taking over of the storage facility by FCI, storage charges are paid for the guaranteed period of 9/10 years.
