ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b)	Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has launched an online portal namely ‘PARIVESH’ for submission and processing of online proposals for approval of use of forest land for non-forestry purposes under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. As per the information available in the portal a total of 3616 projects involving 69414.32 hectares of forest land have been approved for non-forest use under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 in the last five years. The State/UT-wise details are annexed. During the same period Compensatory Afforestation (CA) has been stipulated over more than 126000 hectares.The State/UT-wise and year-wise details of CA stipulated over forest land and non-forest land in the last five years are annexed.(c) & (d)	Complete compliance under Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 is ensured prior to any approval for use of forest area for non-forestry purpose under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is obtained. However, for taking up forestry activities such as afforestation (including those under Compensatory Afforestation Fund), compliance under FRA is not required. As per the provisions under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016 (CAF Act) and in pursuance of an order of Hon’ble Supreme Court on 28thJanuary 2019, an amount of Rs47,872.31 crore has been disbursed to the State Funds of 30 States/UTs till date. As per the provisions of the CAF Act, 2016 and with the constitution of the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (National CAMPA), all the activities related with forestry and wildlife management of each State/UT are proposed through Annual Plan of Operations (APOs) which is approved by the Executive Committee of the National CAMPA for utilisation of the CAMPA Funds. However, the CAF Act, 2016 does not provide mechanism for transfer of Compensatory Afforestation Funds directly to the Gram Sabhas.(e) 	As per norms maximum efforts to make plantation taken up in the forest areas to become viable and contribute enhance the quality of forests. In addition, to ensure effectiveness and sustainability of plantations, following activities are also taken:i.	Site specific interventions including mixed plantation of locally suitable species with provision for long term maintenance. ii.
