                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) The information on deforestation due to various reasons is not maintained at Government of India level. Whenever there is any illicit felling in any forest area, appropriate action is taken up by the concerned State Government/UT Administration as per Indian Forest Act, 1927 or State Specific Forest Act and Rules made there under. Tree felling is also taken up in the forest areas in which non-forestry activities are permitted under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.  In the last three years 69,44,608 trees were removed under different proposals approved under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. In such cases, reforestation through appropriate compensatory afforestation scheme is implemented against loss of such trees. In the last three years a total of 62769.58 hectare land (with plantation of 6,277 crore plants) has been stipulated for compensatory afforestation.Besides levying cost of compensatory afforestation, Net Present Value (NPV) is also levied from the user agency, as a cost towards ecosystem services compromised.Such compensatory afforestation are monitored by the field functionaries of the State Forest Departments and also time to time by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change through its Regional Offices.***
