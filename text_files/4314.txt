ANSWER




MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) Indian Railways endeavour to provide connectivity to various parts of the country, However, trains are not operated on State-wise  basis   as   Railway   network   straddles  across  State boundaries. Prominent stations-like Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam, located in the State of Kerala are connected to important destinations of Northern part of country like Delhi, Jammu Tawi, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra, Dehradun, Amritsar, Chandigarh etc. by services like 12625/12626 Thiruvananthapuram-New Delhi Kerala Express, 16317/16318 Kanniyakumari-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra Himsagar Express, 22659/22660 Kochuveli-Dehradun Express, 12483/12484 Kochuveli-Amritsar Express, 12217/12218 Kochuveli-Chandigarh Kerala Sampark Kranti Express etc. For Guwahati, three pairs of train services are available on the Ernakulam- Guwahati sector. The existing services are catering to the needs of passengers of these sectors and are supplemented by operation of special trains and augmentation of loads of existing services, whenever required.Owing to operational and resource constraints, introduction of additional trains on the Ernakulam – Guwahati sector and additional trains for Northern parts of the country, is not feasible, at present.  However, introduction of trains is an on-going process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility, traffic demand, availability of resources etc. *****
