                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) As per data maintained by National Crime Record Bureau, the conviction rate of States/UTs relating to cognizable crime under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes during 2017 to 2019 is 63.3, 66.6 and 66.5 respectively.(b) to (e) “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to make the police force efficient & capable and its functioning more effective, transparent and accountable.  -2-L.S.US.Q NO. 4548 FOR 23.03.2021The Ministry of Home Affairs circulated Model Police Act, 2006 to all State Governments which has the provision of constituting Police Accountability Commission & District Accountability Authority for ensuring accountability of the police. This Act also describes social responsibility of police. The responsibility includes display of good behaviour with members of public with due courtesy and decorum, guide and assist members of public, particularly senior citizens, women, children, the poor and indigent and physically or mentally challenged individuals found on streets or other public places or otherwise. Further, one of the directions of the Supreme Court of India in the Prakash Singh case on police reforms was to constitute Police Complaints Authorities at the State and District levels for looking into complaints against police officers. These directions were forwarded to the States/UTs for its implementation. Government has taken several steps on Police reforms which is an ongoing process. The Centre also issues advisories to the States to bring in the requisite reforms in the Police to meet the expectations of the people. In order to improve the functioning of the police, the Union Government has set up various Commissions/Committees i.e. National Police Commission (1977), Ribeiro Committee (1998), Padmanabhaiah Committee (2000), Malimath Committee on Criminal Justice (2002). -3-L.S.US.Q NO. 4548 FOR 23.03.2021Further, the Government constituted a Review Committee headed by Shri R.S. Mooshahary to review the recommendations of the previous Commissions and Committees on Police Reforms in December 2004. The Committee submitted its report in March 2005. The Committee shortlisted 49 recommendations.   The recommendations of the Review Committee have been sent to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for taking appropriate action. Bureau of Police Research & Development initiated several training courses, webinars and sessions for State police and investigators to improve the overall rate of conviction through training interventions & skilling them in the use of specialized evidence collection kits.Ministry of Home Affairs included a component of “incentives for police reforms” in the implementation structure of the scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police”. It has been decided to keep certain amount each year for providing incentive/grants to State Government for implementation of Police Reforms.  To incentivize the implementation of police reforms as recommended by various committees, originally a provision of keeping up to 10% of the total annual allocation of the scheme was made.  This incentive component has been increased to ‘up to 20%’ of the total allocation from the year 2019-20.-4-L.S.US.Q NO. 4548 FOR 23.03.2021Ministry of Home Affairs has also introduced a system for ranking of Police stations since 2018. It is a two stage process where 3 Police Stations from States having more than 750 police stations, 2 each from all other States and Delhi and 1 each from Union Territories are selected from more than 16,000 Police Stations in the country on the basis of rate of conviction in cases of crimes against women, crimes against SCs/STs, property offences and missing persons, unidentified found persons & unidentified dead bodies. In the second stage, performance measurement is done based on parameters like crime prevention and proactive measures, disposal of cases, maintenance of public order, infrastructure assessment and citizens feedback. Personal visits are made by the surveying team to the selected police stations for this purpose.The assessment includes considerable focus on various aspects of infrastructure and basic amenities of police stations including solar lighting, energy saving features, Crime and Criminal Tracking Networks and Systems, CCTVs, safe & secure Armoury, record room, communication room for wireless, computers and automated kiosks for filling of complaints by public with a back-end system for tracking follow up action. The guidelines provide for awarding two sets of awards i.e. one for the top 3 best police stations in the country and another for the best police station in each State/Union Territory. This initiative has worked as a demonstration effect for Police Stations in the country to raise their standard of performance.-5-L.S.US.Q NO. 4548 FOR 23.03.2021Government has taken initiatives of Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) and Inter Operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) to bring reforms in the system by using new technology. CCTNS sought to interconnect all police stations and higher police officers for collecting and sharing information on crime and criminals on a common platform. CCTNS was extended to establishment of ICJS by integrating data from prisons, courts, prosecution, forensics and police with a view to strengthen justice delivery system. *****
