                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)::	As per Indian Nursing Council (INC) records, there are around 8,92,829 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), 21,51,850 Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives(RN&RM) and 56,644 Lady Health Visitors(LHV) in the Country.  There are around 8500 Nursing institutions in the country producing about 3 lakh nursing personnel annually.  The nurse patient ratio in the country at present is 1.7 nurses per 1000 population.  However, the nurse-patient ratio varies from State to State, District to District and Institution to Institution.  The problem is more of skewed distribution, with dense concentration of work force in some areas and lesser concentration in other areas causing challenges in delivery of services in certain areas. (b) & (c):	The State/UT-wise distribution of Government and private nursing colleges/institutes in the country is at Annexure.(d):	No.
