ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) 	Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP), the erstwhile National Land Records Modernization Programme was launched in 2008-09as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and converted to a Central Sector Scheme with effect from 1st April, 2016 with 100% funding by the Centre.(b) & (c) Substantial progress has been made under the Programme in the basic requirements of inter alia Computerization of Land Records i.e. Record of Rights (RoR) completed more than 90% in 24 States/UTs(5,98,290villagesout of total 6,58,160 in the country); Cadastral Maps digitized more than 90% in 22 States/UTs(1,09,10,525 maps out of total 1,60,69,413 maps); Computerization of Registration completed more than 90% in 27 States/UTs(4,784 Sub-Registrar Offices out of total 5,211 SROs) and Integration of SROs with Land Records completed more than 90% in 19 States/UTs (3,844 SROs out of total 5,211 SROs).(d)	The Programme is demand driven and depends on the pace of implementation by the States/UTs. Its implementation is a complex, sensitive and voluminous work, involving cumbersome and time-consuming processes. Gestation period of completion of the various activities/components of this Programme is relatively longer as compared to other schemes. In the north-eastern states like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Manipur, the progress is relatively slow due to the fact that land is owned/controlled by the communities and land records of most of the villages are not available with the government. Department is making all possible efforts for speedy implementation of the Programme in these States by holding regional review meetings – in Tripura on 6.9.2018, Manipur on 5-6 August, 2019and Meghalaya on 28.2.2020 to resolve the issue of computerization of land records in the areas where land is owned by communities. Responses are encouraging and some of the north-eastern states have started reporting progress under computerization of land records. The progress of implementation is also monitored regularly by the Department through Regional Review Meetings, Video Conferences, Central Management Information System (MIS) and visits of senior officers.
