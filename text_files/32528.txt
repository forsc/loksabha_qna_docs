ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a): Domestic Natural Rubber (NR)  prices have increased in the country in the recent past.  The average price of RSS4 grade sheet rubber for the period of April to December 2021 was Rs. 172.82 per kg  compared to the yearly average of  Rs. 141.85 per kg during 2020-21.  As domestic Natural Rubber  is highly sensitive and is linked to prevailing international prices of natural rubber, the Government has been taking steps from time to time to ensure that domestic farmers get remunerative prices for their produce.  (b): No such proposal is under consideration of the Government.(c) & (d): The task force on rubber sector has recommended treating Natural rubber (NR) as an agricultural product and its inclusion under Minimum Support Scheme (MSP).  The Government of India fixes MSP for 25 agricultural crops. These prices are fixed on the basis of recommendations of   the   Commission   for   Agricultural   Costs  &   Prices  (CACP).   Natural Rubber is not included in the selected 25 crops for which Minimum Support Price (MSP) is notified, as it does not fulfill most of the criteria for inclusion under MSP, and is not covered under the Comprehensive Scheme for studying the cost of cultivation of principal crops in India.*******
