                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c) Since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of potable water to every rural household through tap water connection of the country, including those in the State of Rajasthan, by 2024. Drinking Water being a State subject, it is States, who plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual projects/ schemes for rural water supply projects, including their foundation and inauguration programme details, are not maintained at the Government of India level. The details of Central fund allocated, released/ drawn by the State and reported utilization in Rajasthan under JJM in 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22 (as on 21.03.2022) is as under:Year	Central share	Expenditure under Stare Share	Opening Balance	Fund allocated	Fund released	Available fund	Reported utilization	2019-20	313.67	1,301.71	1,301.71	1,615.38	620.31	698.542020-21	995.07	2,522.03	630.51	1625.58	762.04	789.052021-22	 863.53 	 10,180.50 	 2,345.08  	 3,208.61 	 1,330.74	868.56Further, recognizing the key role Hon’ble Members of Parliament (MP)/ elected representatives can play in mobilizing the local community and empowering them to ensure assured piped water supply in rural homes, provisions have been made in the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission to enable their participation to make Jal Jeevan Mission truly a people’s movement, i.e. ''Jan Andolan''. In this regard, an advisory has been issued to all States/ UTs elaborating the roles of MPs wherein States/ UTs have been specifically requested to ensure that:i.)	Hon’ble MPs are consulted while preparing District Action Plans for water supply schemes and are also invited as ‘special invitees’ in all the DWSM meetings; ii.)	convening of State/ District level DISHA meeting on regular intervals, for monitoring the progress of implementation of JJM; and iii.)	invitation to various official functions organized for bhoomi pujan, inauguration/ commissioning of schemes, etc. for which district/ divisional level officers to be sensitized.*****
