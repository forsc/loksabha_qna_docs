ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) 	The details of quantity and value of exports and imports of foodgrains and other agricultural products, during the last three years and the current year, are at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. Country-wise details for the last three years (top 10 countries) are at Annexure-III. As export and import of agricultural products depend on several factors such as International & domestic demand & supply situation, international & domestic prices, quality concerns, food security concerns etc., no targets for exports or imports are fixed.………2/--2-(b) 	The share of agriculture sector in the country’s total exports, during the last three years, has been as under:Year	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Share of agriculture sector in total exports	12.07%	12.66%	11.76%Source: DGCI&SState/Union Territory-wise data is not published by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCI&S).(c) 	Overall exports of agricultural products grew by 2.64% in 2016-17 as compared to the previous year. The exports of tea, spices and manufactured tobacco grew by 1.56%, 12.22% and 2.41% respectively while the exports of unmanufactured tobacco declined by 4.65%. Some of the major commodities, which registered a decline in exports were buffalo meat (-4.07%), basmati rice (-7.75%) and cotton (-16.38%). There are several reasons for the decline viz. lower prices and demand in the international market, unfavourable currency movements, international developments like sanctions against Iran and Russia etc. (d) 	No study has been conducted to assess the long term impact of exports on the agricultural and horticultural sector by the Department of Commerce. However,  it is expected that exports not only provide better market opportunities to the growers but also generally help in increasing their income.(e) To promote the agricultural exports, The Government has introduced a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy with the following vision:-“Harness export potential of Indian agriculture, through suitable policy instruments, to make India a global power in agriculture, and raise farmers’ income.”Inter-alia, the objectives of the Agriculture Export policy are as under:(i)	To diversify our export basket, destinations and boost high value and value added agricultural exports, including focus on perishables. (ii)	To promote novel, indigenous, organic, ethnic, traditional and non-traditional Agri products exports.(iii)	To provide an institutional mechanism for pursuing market access, tackling barriers and dealing with sanitary and phytosanitary issues.(iv)	To strive to double India’s share in world agri exports by integrating with global value chains.(v)	Enable farmers to get benefit of export opportunities in overseas market.The Government has also brought out a new Central Sector Scheme – ‘Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products’ - for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products, and marketing of agricultural products.The Department of Commerce also has several schemes to promote exports, including exports of agricultural products, viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.
