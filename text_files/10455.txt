ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (e) The erstwhile Planning Commission constituted an Expert Group under the Chairmanship of Prof. Suresh D. Tendulkar on 2nd December, 2005 to review the methodology for estimation of poverty. The Expert Group submitted its report on 8th December 2009. Some of the major recommendations of the committee are as follows:1. The Expert Group has acknowledged the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and recommended the estimates of poverty continue to be based on private household consumer expenditure collected by National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO). 2. The Group has recommended moving away from anchoring the poverty lines to the calorie intake norm.  3. In line with the decision of the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), it has been recommended to adopt the Mixed Reference Period (MRP) based estimates of consumption expenditure as the basis for future poverty lines.  4. The Expert Group has also recommended MRP equivalent of urban Poverty Line Basket (PLB) corresponding to 25.7% urban headcount ratio as the new reference PLB. The rural poverty line should be recomputed to reflect money value in rural areas of the same poverty line basket (PLB) that is recommended as the new reference PLB for urban areas.The Tendulkar Committee recommended Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) of Rs. 447 for rural areas and Rs 579 for urban areas as the poverty line for the year 2004-05, which was accepted by the erstwhile Planning commission. The State-wise poverty line and poverty ratio in urban and rural areas for the year 2004-05 are given at Annexure-I. The erstwhile Planning Commission had been using Tendulkar Committee methodology to estimate the poverty line and the poverty ratio at national and state level. For the year 2011-12, the erstwhile Planning Commission, using the poverty line recommended by the Tendulkar Committee for 2004-05 and updating it to 2011-12 had estimated the poverty lines as monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) of Rs. 816 in rural areas and Rs. 1000 in urban areas. The number of persons living below poverty line in India has been estimated as 27 crore (21.9%) in 2011-12. These poverty lines vary from state to state because of price differentials. The State wise poverty line and number of persons living below poverty line in 2011-12 for rural and urban areas are given at Annexure-II.
