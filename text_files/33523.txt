ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS {SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR} (a) & (b): As per the information provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital or video gaming activities. It has not been recognized as a primary disorder by most of the classificatory systems as of date. It is an evolving field and diagnostic criteria are still not formalized all over the world. But individual institutes and researchers are doing studies to understand the problem. (c) & (d): Betting and Gambling come under List II of Seventh Schedule (Entry 34) of the Constitution of India, for which States are competent to enact laws. However, e-sports, which is in the nature of competitive sport and which has also been included in the Asian Games, 2022 falls within the regulatory purview of the National Sports Development Code of India, 2011.***
