                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a):	Yes Sir.  (b):	Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing a Centrally Sponsored "PM Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme" for providing financial, technical and business support for upgradation of micro food processing enterprises in the country. Support to upgrade existing units or setting up of new micro units for individuals is provided through a credit linked grants-in-aid @35% upto maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakhs. The Scheme also provides support to food processing units of SHGs/ FPOs/ Cooperatives for credit linked grants-in-aid @35%, Seed Capital to SHGs, Incubation Centre, Common Infrastructure, Marketing & Branding and Capacity Building. The Scheme adopts One District One Product (ODOP) approach to reap the benefit of scale in terms of procurement of inputs, availing common services and marketing of products. ODOP for the scheme provides the framework for value chain development and alignment of support infrastructure. The details of the proposals / applications for establishing individual micro food processing units and seed capital received under the scheme from Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand is at Annexure-I. (c) & (d). The Ministry does not set up mini food parks on its own. However, MoFPI has been implementing the Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Processing Clusters (APC) under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) to incentivize the setting up of agro processing clusters in the country. Till date, Ministry has approved 68 agro processing cluster projects. However, no APC project has been approved in Jharkhand under the scheme due to non-receipt of eligible proposals from the State. The State-wise number of APC projects sanctioned under the scheme are at Annexure-II. *****
