ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):	 GST has been introduced by the Government of India to rationalize multiple taxes on goods & services and to bring transparency in the taxation system. Accordingly, it is applicable to the Textile sectors also, including handlooms. Turnover of most of the weavers does not exceed Rs.40 Lakh and hence they do not require registration under GST. Moreover, GST is implemented through an Act of Parliament with States as equal partners in GST Council with Government of India. GST is applicable on each stage of the value chain i.e. cotton fibre, yarn and fabric @ 5% with facilities of input credit.*******
