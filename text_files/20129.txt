                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b)  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), is a demand driven wage employment programme. A rural household, adult members of which agree to do unskilled manual work, is entitled for hundred days of wage employment. During the financial year 2020-21 (so far), more than 1.61 crore new job cards have been issued. Total number of person worked during the current FY 2020-21 (as on 06.02.2021) is 10.36 crore which is 31% more than that of the FY 2019-20. During FY 2020-21 (as on 06.02.2021), more than 326 crore person-days have been generated, which is approximately 44% more than the employment generated during the same period in FY 2019-20. (c) to (e) The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), is a demand driven wage employment programme. A rural household, adult members of which agree to unskilled manual work, is entitled for hundred days of wage employment. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. During the current financial year 2020-21 (as on 06.02.2021), a total number of 36.35 lakh households received 100 days and more of employment under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.*****
