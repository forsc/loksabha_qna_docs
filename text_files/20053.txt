                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the seventh Schedule  to  the Constitution  of  India.  Modernization of police forces is a continuous and ongoing process.  However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments towards equipping and modernizing  of  their  police  forces,  under  the  scheme  of  ‘Assistance  to --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 1228 FOR 09.02.2021States for Modernisation of Police’ [erstwhile scheme of Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF)]. Under this scheme, State Governments are provided central assistance for acquiring advanced weaponry such as Assault Rifles, all types of surveillance equipment including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Night Vision Devices (NVDs), CCTV surveillance systems and body worn camera systems, modern communication equipment and state-of-the-art equipment for Intelligence branches & forensic science laboratories. The State Governments are free to include proposals in accordance with their strategic priorities and requirements. The details of the funds allocated and released to the States and expenditure incurred by the States during the last three years and current year are at Annexure.(c): Significant technical developments have taken place in the State Police Forces though they are at different levels of modernization as per their requirements and resources. The major technological developments reported are that of Police forces shifting from analog to digital technology in  communication,  upgradation  of forensic lab equipments and more lethal weaponry. Body worn cameras and UAVs/drones are being increasingly used by the Police Forces. In  the field of investigation, various new technologies --3--L.S.US.Q.NO. 1228 FOR 09.02.2021are being adopted such as Automatic Finger Print Identification System (AFIS), 3D Crime Scene Scanner etc. (d)& (e): The office of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) regularly audits expenditure under the Scheme at the various police directorates. In addition, the Ministry of Home Affairs conducts Concurrent Audit of the Scheme and release of funds has been linked with submission of Action Taken Report (ATR) on the observations of audit reports by the State Governments. Performance of the scheme is evaluated from time to time and several studies have been conducted including Impact Assessment study of MPF scheme conducted by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BP&RD), an Evaluation Study of MPF scheme conducted by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BP&RD) and evaluation study commissioned by Niti Aayog in respect of the schemes of the umbrella scheme of Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF). ****
