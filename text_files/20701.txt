                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):	Gulbarga Textile Park, Gulbarga was approved on November 8, 2011 with a project cost of Rs. 46.39 cr of which  GoI grant is Rs. 18.56 cr. An amount of  Rs. 1.85 cr has been released to the project so far. During Project Approval Committee (PAC) meeting held on 03.12.2019, the SPV stated that the park is facing equity generation issue from last 2-3 years as very small manufacturers are involved in the Park. SPV is also facing some constraints at the level of State Govt. from last 2 years.  PAC upon deliberations, observed that the prospect of the park is very low as it is not able to generate enough equity from last 2-3 years. Accordingly, PAC decided to cancel the park. ***
