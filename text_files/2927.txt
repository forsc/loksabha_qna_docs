                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) & (b): Manual Scavenging is prohibited under Section 5 of the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013” (MS Act, 2013) no person, local authority or any agency shall, after the date of commencement of this Act,- engage or employ, either directly or indirectly, a manual scavenger, and every person so engaged or employed shall stand discharged immediately from any obligation, express or implied, to do manual scavenging. Under Sections 11 and 14 of the MS Act, 2013, if any Municipality or Gram Panchayat have reason to believe that some persons are engaged or employed as manual scavengers, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the concerned Municipality and Gram Panchayat shall cause a survey to identify such persons. In addition, any person working as manual scavenger can also apply for being identified as manual scavengers to the concerned CEO of the municipality or Gram Panchayat. Such claims would be verified for inclusion in the list of manual scavengers. As per these provisions 13 States have reported identification of 14,505 manual scavengers upto 30.06.2019.On the basis of information provided by the social organizations and the data relating to conversion of insanitary latrines into sanitary latrines under Swachh Bharat Mission, a National Survey was carried out during 2018 in 170 districts of 18 States which has resulted in identification of 39,093 manual scavengers. Thus a total of 53,598 manual scavengers have been identified from 06.12.2013 upto 30.06.2019.(c): There have been no reports from any State/Union Territory regarding conviction in such cases.(d): Under Section 19 of the MS Act, 2013 the District Magistrate and the authority authorized under section 18 or any other subordinate officer specified by them shall ensure that no person is engaged or employed as manual scavenger within their jurisdiction and also ensure investigation and prosecution of persons contravening the provisions of section 5 of the MS Act, 2013. The State Governments have been requested to ensure implementation of these provisions and furnish monthly progress report in this regard.****
