Since its inception, Fit India Mission has been actively spreading awareness about fitness through various campaigns which inter-alia include a campaign, namely, Fit India Cyclothon to create awareness on fitness through cycling. Fit India Cyclothon can be organised by any Government or private organisation, schools, colleges, universities, individuals, interested groups, residential associations, communities in villages, towns, workplaces, etc.(b) to (d) No, Sir. The Government has not constituted any team to take stock of the condition of all the stadiums and sports of the country. ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the primary responsibility for promotion and development of sports is that of State/Union Territory Governments.
