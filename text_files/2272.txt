ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) Yes, Sir. During the period from January to June 2019, four letters have been received regarding high airfare and delinquent services at airport. Two letters are regarding high airfare in Kolkata-Aizawl-Kolkata sector, one is regarding high airfare in respect of flights to and fro Srinagar and one is regarding misbehaviour by an Indigo staffer at Bagdogra airport.;(b) In respect of two letters, M/s Air India have informed that fares offered by them are competitive and are based on market considerations such as fares offered by the competitors, seasonality, product features like frequency, timings, direct/ indirect operations, etc. Fares offered are multiple levels on the domestic network. At no point of time the fares are arbitrarily increased. The issues in other two letters are under process. (c) & (d) As per the prevailing regulation, air fare is neither regulated nor established by the Government. Airlines are free to fix the reasonable tariff under the provision of Sub-rule (1) of Rule 135 of Aircraft Rules 1937 having regard to all relevant factors including the cost of operation, characteristics of service, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff.;Fares offered by airlines are market driven primarily depending on demand and supply. On the supply side, the Government has facilitated the induction of more aircraft by airlines to check any rise in airfare.
