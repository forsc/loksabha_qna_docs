                                                        (a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Operational Guidelines of Scheme of Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH) under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), provides for conducting a systematic third party survey by the local/ municipal bodies so as   to   assess   accurately the   need   for shelters at suitable locations. So far, 22 States/ Union Territories (UTs) have conducted third party survey through which 2,07,847 urban homeless persons have been identified. The States/ UTs-wise details are at Annexure.(c) & (d): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/ UT Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for providing permanenthouses to destitute persons. However, Government of India through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission, has been providing technical and financial assistance to States/ UTs to provide houses with basic civic amenities to eligible urban poor including destitute persons.                                *****
