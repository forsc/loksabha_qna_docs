Further, as per Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, it is mandatory to give particulars of ingredients as well as nutritional information such as energy value, carbohydrate, protein and fat.  Apart from these, there are other mandatory nutrition declarations as specified in these Regulations.               As regards fancy price of packed food products, no such incidence is reported to Ministry of Food Processing Industries as on date.

In terms of Section 31 of FSS Act, 2006, no person shall commence or carry on any food business without a valid license/registration under FSS Act, 2006.
