                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. Under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), earlier the households included in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) list were considered the target group. Subsequently, from 2014-15 onwards, the criteria has been changed. All households with at least one deprivation, as per the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 database, are included in the DAY-NRLM target group. In addition, all households identified through the process of Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) and vetted by the Gram Sabha can also be covered under the Programme. (c) & (d) The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) across the country in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs), and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take up economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty.            DAY-NRLM also has a sub-scheme namely Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) to promote entrepreneurship at village level. The block is the unit of implementation of SVEP. The objective of the scheme is to help the rural poor (SHGs) to set-up enterprises at the village level in non-agricultural sectors. Besides providing start-up capital, a cadre of Community Resource Persons-Enterprise Promotion (CRP-EP) is set up to provide business support services to the enterprises. Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), which is another sub-scheme of DAY-NRLM, aims at meeting the specific needs of women farmers to enable them to achieve socio-economic empowerment. The primary objective of the MKSP is to empower women in agriculture by making systematic investments to enhance their participation and productivity, as also create and sustain their agriculture-based livelihoods. The scheme also supports development of a pool of Community Resource Persons to enable the community institutions to manage their activities.During the last three years i.e 2018-2021 (up to January, 2021), 2,63,52,365 Households have been mobilized under DAY-NRLM and 14,57,213 Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been promoted. Additionally, in the last three years 1.02 Crore SHGs have been disbursed 1,913.84 Lakh Crore of credit through Banks. Further, under SVEP 1,13,159 enterprises have been formed during the last three years. Under MKSP, more than 38 lakh Mahila Kisans have been supported. Overall, more than 1.10 Crore Mahila Kisans have been supported under the Mission.The State-wise details of the beneficiaries under NRLM during the last three years including Maharashtra are provided at Annexure. ****Annexure referred in reply to Part (c) & (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 4377 for answer on 23.03.2021 regarding “Deen Dayal Antodaya Rashtriya Ajeevika Mission”Households Mobilized into SHGs under DAY-NRLM
