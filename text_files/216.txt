In order to ensure period of calm during the resolution process, a moratorium was sought against the creditors, which has been granted on interim basis by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) until further orders. Justice (Retd.) D.K. Jain, Supreme Court of India has been appointed by the NCLAT to oversee the monetization and resolution of the assets of IL&FS and its group companies. As per the information provided by IL&FS, the fund based outstanding debt (principal amount) is Rs. 94,216 Crores and the non-fund based outstanding debt is Rs. 5,139 Crores.
