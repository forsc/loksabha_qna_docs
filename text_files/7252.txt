These guidelines are available on NDMA’s website:www.ndma.gov.in•	Setting up of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for prompt response and pre-positioning of NDRF in disaster vulnerable areas and preposition them across various vulnerable locations in the country. •	Strengthening of State and District Disaster Management systems through various schemes of Central Government.•	Capacity buildings of various stake holders including State Disaster Response Force of States/UTs by providing training through NDRF.•	Construction of multi-purpose cyclone shelters in coastal States and training of coastal communities on shelters during 2011-2020.•	Carrying out capacity building of disaster professionals and communities by NDMA, NDRF and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM).•	The early warning is provided by the forecasting agencies of Government of India on real time basis for the impending disasters to all the concerned stakeholders for taking appropriate precautionary measures.
