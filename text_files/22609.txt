ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c):  The UDAN Scheme is subject to periodic review. Acknowledging the fact that market dynamics change over time, MoCA may amend various Scheme provisions from time to time as and when necessary for efficacy in accomplishment of objectives. Thus, it is a continuous process and the ministry has been reviewing the scheme from time to time in consultations with the stakeholder and takes necessary course corrections wherever requires. The primary objective of the UDAN is to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable and connecting unserved / underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes. Ramnad, Salem , Arakkonam, Chettinad, Cholavaram, Neyveli, Sulur, Ulundurpet, Vellore Airports of Tamil Nadu are included in the scheme documents. The implementing agency, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has awarded 39 UDAN routes in Tamil Nadu till completion of Phase I of 4.0 round of bidding. Out of these, 12 routes have been operationalized by the Selected Airline Operators. The implementing agency, AAI, subsequently cancelled 19 RCS routes due to non-compliance by Selected Airline Operator (SAO).
