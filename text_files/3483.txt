                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):   Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres(AB-HWCs) is being implemented in all States/UTs except UT of Delhi.  Facilities under AB-HWCs are available to all.           As on June 2019, 33 states/UTs have signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for implementation of Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and the scheme is operational in 30 States/UTs. Only Delhi, Odisha and Telangana have not signed the MoU. The implementation of the scheme has been rolled back in West Bengal by the State Government. States have not cited any particular reason for non-implementation of the scheme.  Action is at hand to convince these States/UT to join the scheme so that eligible sections of such states/UT may avail the benefits under the scheme.…………
