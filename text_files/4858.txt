                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	 Cancer is being diagnosed and treated at various levels in the Government health care system. While doctors with D. M. (Medical Oncology), M.Ch (Surgical Oncology) and M.D. (Radiation Oncology) treat Cancer patients in higher level tertiary care hospitals, Cancer is also being treated in hospitals by other Doctors such as General Surgeons, Gynecologists, ENT Surgeons etc., depending on the type and site of Cancer.To support the States/UTs for interventions upto district level, the Government of India is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) under National Health Mission (NHM). The focus under the programme is on common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), namely hypertension, diabetes and three common cancers (oral, breast and cervical).In addition, population based prevention, control, screening and management for hypertension, diabetes and common cancers (oral, breast and cervical) has been rolled out in more than 215 districts under NHM. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centre.  	The Government of India is also implementing “Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities” Scheme under NPCDCS to assist to establish/set up State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. Oncology is one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and 2nd campus of Chittranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata has also been approved. All these will enhance the capacity for prevention and treatment of cancer in the country.(c): 	The cancer survival rate is generally believed to depend upon amongst others, stage at diagnosis, stage of initiation of treatment, type and site of cancer, correct and complete treatment. Cancer can be diagnosed and treated at various levels in the Health care system.According to an article “Global surveillance of trends in cancer survival 2000-14 (CONCORD-3): published in LANCET, there are differences in survival rates across countries. The study estimates 5-year survival for breast cancer as 88.2% in Canada, 68.78% in Thailand, 76.5 % in Poland and 66.1% in India.However, the coverage of population in the study is reported to vary from higher coverage in European Countries while it is reported to cover about 0.1 % of population in India. The study has indicated various reasons for variations in survival rate of cancer. (d): 	As per Indian Council of Medical Research’s data, the estimated number of incidence of cancer cases and related deaths reported during the last three years, state/UT- wise, are at Annexures I and II, respectively.
