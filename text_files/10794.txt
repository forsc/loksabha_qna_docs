                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b) As informed by National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), no information is available in this regard. (c) to (d) ‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and as such prevention of the crime of human trafficking and crime against children is the responsibility of State Governments. However, the Government of India has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments by taking various initiatives and measures. The Government of India has provided financial assistance to all States for setting up of Anti-Human Trafficking Units and 332 Anti-Human Trafficking Units have been set-up in various districts of the State. The Government of India also provides financial assistance to the States and judicial academies in States to hold ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and ‘ State level conference’ to sensitize police officials, judicial officers and prosecutors about various provisions of law relevant to trafficking and their role in curbing trafficking. The Government of India has also issued various advisories to the State Governments and UT Administrations, from time to time, on preventing and combating human trafficking. Through the National Investigation Agencies (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Schedule of NIA Act, 2008 has been amended and National Investigation Agency has been empowered to investigate the cases committed under Section 370 and 370A of Indian Penal Code relating to Human Trafficking. To address the cross border trafficking, Memorandum of Understanding on prevention of human trafficking have been signed with Bangladesh, UAE and Cambodia. Further as per Section 2 (14) (ix) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is found vulnerable and is likely to be inducted into drug abuse or trafficking is included as a “child in need of care and protection”. The JJ Act, 2015 mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional and non-Institutional care to these children. The Act contains a separate chapter on offences against children including Section 84 of the Act which provides for dealing with cases of kidnapping and abduction of children. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the States/UTs. The scheme inter-alia provides for setting up of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by the States/UTs either by themselves or in association with voluntary organizations. The scheme, also provides for non-institutional care wherein support is extended for adoption, foster care, and sponsorship. The scheme supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress. This service is available through a dedicated toll-free number, 1098 which can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India.(e) Does not arise.*********
