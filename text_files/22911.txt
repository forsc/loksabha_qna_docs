                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	 to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *349 TO BE ANSWERED ON 19.03.2021 ON SHORTAGE OF STAFF IN RADIO STATIONS. (a) to (c): Yes, Sir. Prasar Bharati Recruitment Board has been constituted on 01.07.2020 in accordance with Ministry of Information & Broadcasting notification dated 12.02.2020  for vacancies carrying scale of pay less than that of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India. The process of recruitment to fill up the backlog vacancies for physically impaired persons is already initiated by the Board. Before establishment of Prasar Bharati Recruitment Board, limited recruitment has been undertaken as a special dispensation through Staff Selection Commission for Critical Group ‘B’ and Group ‘C’ vacancies, approved by the Government on an All India basis in 2013. As a result, 1358 officers have finally joined in various States including Gujarat. As regards filling up of the vacancies by promotion, continued efforts have been made by Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and Prasar Bharati in accordance with extant instructions of DoP&T. Promotions are an ongoing process and every effort is made to fill up the posts by promotion expeditiously. Further, the Manpower Audit of Prasar Bharati has been carried out which has found key gaps in Prasar Bharati''s existing manpower mix and skill capabilities due to changes in technology, I.T. enablement and automation. The Manpower Audit has recommended several steps to phase out obsolete technologies and unviable services, automate and IT enable key operations and to outsource non-core activities so as to bring the manpower requirements in line with global best practices in Public Broadcasting. State/ UT-wise (including Gujarat) details of shortage of officers/ staff for broadcasting of various programmes from Radio Stations are at Annexure. *****
