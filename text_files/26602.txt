                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) The Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), an Institute under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has conducted a study in 2013-14 sponsored by Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Government of India on “Assessment of Quantitative Harvest and Post-Harvest Losses of Major Crops/Commodities in India”. The study included assessment of harvest and post harvest losses of 45 crops and livestock produce like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables, plantation crops, spices, fish, eggs, poultry meat and milk. The losses have been assessed in farm operations (harvesting, collection, sorting, grading, drying, packaging and transport) and storage channels (farm, godown/cold storage, wholesaler, retailer and processing unit). .......2/--2-               As per the study report, the harvest and post-harvest losses of cereals ranged from 4.65 - 5.99%, for pulses ranged from 6.36 - 8.41%, for major fruits ranged from 6.70 % to 15.88% and for vegetables the losses ranged from 4.58% to 12.44%. The details on crop wise losses as assessed by the study are in Annexure.        No further study has been conducted to assess Quantitative Harvest and Post-Harvest Losses of Crops/Commodities to compare reduction of losses.         However, foodgrain stocks under Central Pool are issued by Food Corporation of India (FCI) to States/UTs as per the allocation. The quantum of foodgrains including wheat and rice damaged FCI for the last three years is as under:Year	Damage accrued in FCI (Fig. in  Lakh tonnes)	% age of damaged foodgrains w.r.t. quantity handled (offtake)2018-19	0.05	0.0102019-20	0.02	0.0042020-21	0.02	0.003 Owing to various steps taken by the Government, the foodgrains accrued as damaged/ non-issuable in FCI has come down from 0.05 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 to 0.02 lakh tonnes in 2020-21.(c) & (d):   CIPHET has been working on R&D activities towards the development of tools, machines and technologies for storage, post harvest processing and value addition of agricultural commodities to minimize the losses. The Institute established around 228 agro processing centres (APC) and value addition to farm produce. Hands on trainings/ demonstrations to farmers, entrepreneurs and self-help groups engaged in agriculture and related activities to create awareness in reduction of post-harvest losses are undertaken.  ***** AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a)&(b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2476 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 03.08.2021 IN LOK SABHA.DETAILS ON QUANTITATIVE LOSSES OF MAJOR CROPS AT NATIONAL LEVELS.
