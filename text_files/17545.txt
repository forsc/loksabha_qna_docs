                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a) to (c): With regard to returns on deposit accounts of bank accountholders vis-a-vis rise in inflation, it is stated that as per data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for the terminal month of the financial year 2019-20 (March 2020), the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) offered by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) was 6.38%, while the Consumer Price Index inflation rate was 5.84% at the end of March 2020.RBI has further apprised that interest rates on advances and deposits are subject to directions issued by RBI under the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as per which the interest rates in respect of SCBs are as per Board-approved policy, subject to RBI guidelines in this regard. It is further stated that different banks offer different rates, depending upon, inter alia, their fund requirements, tenor premium and profile of the depositor, such as whether or not they are senior citizens.With regard to good deposit rates to depositors and encouragement to financial savings, it is stated that Government has introduced small savings schemes like the  Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, SukanyaSamridhiYojana, Public Provident Fund and Post Office Saving schemes, which offer higher rate of interest as compared to the average rate of interest on other financial instruments. With regard to assessment of returns on deposit accounts, it is stated that RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee in its Monetary Policy report of April 2020 had assessed monetary policy transmission to banks’ term deposits and stated that policy rate cut to WADTDR on outstanding Rupee deposits has improved to 39 basis points (bps) during the period from October 2019 to February, from 7 bps during the previous eight months (February to September 2019).***
