ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????         ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):  As per 2nd Advance Estimates, total Horticulture production for 2020-21 is estimated to be 329.86 Million Tonne, outnumbering the food grain production of 305.44 Million Tonne.(c), (d) & (e):  The Horticulture production in the country has been steadily increasing over the years due to pro-active policies and initiatives of the Government of India and the State Governments and improved crop production technologies & management practices. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Horticulture for the last 5 years is a healthy 2.35%.     For the holistic development of horticulture, for increasing area, production and creation of post-harvest infrastructure, the Government is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in the State/UTs since 2014-15. Under MIDH, support for production of quality planting material, area expansion of fruits, vegetables , spices and plantation crops, protected cultivation and creation  of post harvest management infrastructures, training & capacity building etc. of farmers are provided.    The projects proposals of State Governments for horticulture development are also supported under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana(RKVY) scheme.   The total Horticulture production in 2020-21 has increased to 329.86 Million Tonne (2nd Advance Estimate) from 320.47 Million Tonne (2.83%) achieved in 2019-20, due to a number of factors such as effective implementation of  Central and State Government schemes for Horticulture, increase in area coverage from 26.48 Million Ha.  to 27.23 Million Ha., more than average rainfall in 2020-21 leading to better availability of water.(f): The Government implements the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period. The condition is that there should be either at least a 10 percent increase in production or a 10 percent decrease in the ruling market prices over the previous normal year. The scheme is implemented at the request of a State/UT government which is ready to bear 50 percent of the loss (25 percent in case of North-Eastern States), if any, incurred on its implementation. The extent of total amount of loss to be shared on a 50:50 basis between the Central Government and the State Government is restricted to 25 percent of the total procurement value which includes cost of the commodity procured plus permitted overhead expenses. Under the scheme, in accordance with MIS guidelines, a pre-determined quantity at the fixed Market Intervention Price (MIP) is procured by the agencies designated by the State Government for a fixed period or till the prices are stabilized above the MIP whichever is earlier.     In order to promote creation of scientific Storage infrastructure and  Marketing infrastructure (other than Storage), the Government is implementing a sub-scheme “Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI)” of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) across the country. The rural godowns enable small farmers to enhance their holding capacity in order to sell their produce at remunerative prices and avoid distress sale. AMI is demand driven, credit linked, back ended subsidy scheme. Subsidy support @ 25% and 33.33% is available for beneficiaries viz. Farmers, Individuals, Agri-preneurs, Farmer Producer Organisations, Cooperatives, state agencies etc. *****
