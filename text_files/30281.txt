ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d) 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.170 due for reply on 09.12.2021.(a) to (b)    Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] was launched by the Government on 2ndOctober, 2014, with the main aim to make the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2nd October, 2019, by providing access to toilets to all the rural households of the country.  During the period of five years from 2014 to 2019, more than 10 crore individual household latrines were constructed under the SBM(G).  As a result, all the villages in the country declared themselves ODF by 2nd October, 2019.  Studies undertaken by some international and UN organisations have observed noticeable gains towards social, economic and health benefits due to successful implementation of the programme.  The gist of some of them is indicated below:(i)	A UNICEF study titled ‘The Financial and Economic Impact of Swachh Bharat Mission in India’ released in 2017 estimated that a household in an ODF village in India saves Rs.50,000 every year.(ii)	A WHO Study titled ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Preliminary estimations of potential health impacts from increased sanitation coverage’ released in 2018, estimated that SBM(G) would result in averting more than 3,00,000 deaths (diarrhoea and protein-energy malnutrition) between 2014 and October 2019.  (iii)	A study undertaken jointly by UNICEF and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in February, 2020 titled ‘Access to toilets and the safety, convenience and self-respect of women in rural India’, observed that the increased access to household toilets has led to the improvement in the Suvidha (convenience), Suraksha (safety) and Swabhimaan (self-respect) of women in rural India.  By not going out in the open to defecate, 93% women feel safer.Successful implementation of SBM (G) has also been able to enhance capacity of Gram Panchayats to plan and implement development programmes, especially sanitation and hygiene related programmes, and increase dignity and convenience for women and adolescent girls by providing them toilets at home.(c) & (d)   All villages have become ODF.  Having achieved the outcomes of ODF, Phase-2 of SBM (G) is now being implemented to support the villages to sustain the ODF status and to make solid and liquid waste management arrangements by 2024-25, i.e. to convert the villages from ODF to ODF Plus.*****
