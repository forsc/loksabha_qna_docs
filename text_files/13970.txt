                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) :  The Hon’ble Supreme Court, while affirming the conviction of the accused, Budhadev Karmaskar for murdering a sex worker in Calcutta in the year 1999, converted the said appeal into a public interest litigation to look into various aspects of sex workers’ rehabilitation and to provide them with a dignified life. Subsequently, on 19.07.2011, a panel of five members was set up by the Hon’ble Supreme Court under the Chairpersonship of Shri Pradip Ghosh, Senior Advocate. The Panel presented its report to the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 14.09.2016. At present, the matter is sub-judice before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.(b) :	Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing the Schemes ‘Ujjawala’ and ‘Swadhar Greh.  Ujjawala Scheme is for combating trafficking, with five specific components – Prevention, Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-Integration and Repatriation (cross-border) of victims of trafficking. The scheme has been conceived primarily for the purpose of preventing trafficking on the one hand and rescue and rehabilitation of victims on the other. The scheme provides for rehabilitation of victims by providing food, shelter, counselling, medical care, legal aid and vocational training as well as their reintegration into society. Swadhar Greh Scheme targets women living in difficult circumstances without social and economic support like deserted women and women survivors of natural disaster who have been rendered homeless, trafficked women/girls, women victims of terrorist violence, mentally challenged women/girls who are without support and women with HIV/AIDS deserted by family. These women are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing and health services as well as economic and social security for them along with facilitating their emotional and economic rehabilitation into the society. *****
