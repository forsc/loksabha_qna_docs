This contraction reflects the unparalleled effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic. The fundamentals of the economy remain strong as gradual scaling back of Covid-19 restrictions, along with the astute support of various government interventions has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery. As per 2nd Advance Estimates released by NSO, GDP is estimated to grow at 8.9 percent in 2021-22 with the level of real GDP surpassing the pre-COVID level of 2019-20. With regard to the manufacturing sector, manufacturing sector Gross Value Added (GVA) is estimated to have contracted by 0.6 percent in 2020-21, but estimated to grow by 10.5 percent in 2021-22 as per the second advance estimates Similar trend is witnessed in case of Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The cumulative growth of IIP for the period April-January 2021-22 is 13.7 per cent as compared to (-)12.0 per cent in April-January 2020-21, indicating significant improvement of industrial production in the current financial year. Restrictions imposed on account of Covid-19 has had an impact on labour market as well in 2020-21. With the recovery in 2021-22, the labour market has been buoyant. Net payroll data of Employees'' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) as on 20th February, 2022, shows new subscribers increasing from 77.1 lakhs in 2020-21 to 92.4 lakhs during April-December period of 2021-22. (c) The economic recovery in 2021-22 is a result of measures taken by Government. In FY 2020-21, Government had announced a special economic and comprehensive package under AtmaNirbhar Bharat (ANB) Abhiyaan to combat the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, to revive economic growth and to bolster employment. The package included, among others, in-kind and cash transfer relief measures for households, employment provision measures under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan and increased allocation under MGNREGS, credit guarantee and equity infusion-based relief measures for MSMEs and NBFCs and regulatory and compliance measures.
