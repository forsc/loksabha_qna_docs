The Memorandum of Understanding envisages establishment and promotion of cooperation between the two countries in the field of environment protection and management of natural resources on the basis of equity, reciprocity and mutual benefits, taking into account the applicable laws and legal provisions in each country. However, the MOU is still to be signed by both the countries.Further, the Memorandum of Understanding between Government of India and the Government of Nepal is being finalized through consultative process. The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between  India and Bhutan and Nepal would  help in overall conservation of  wildlife that move across the borders, including species like Elephant, Tiger, Rhinoceros, Snow Leopard, River Dolphin, Vultures, migratory birds, etc. and would also help in strengthening the capacities of officials in areas of  eco-tourism promotion and livelihood improvement of local communities through trans boundary cooperation.	***
