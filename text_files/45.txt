                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (BBBP) launched by Hon’ble  Prime Minister on 22nd January, 2015 addresses the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues of women empowerment and aims to change mindsets to value girl child. It is a tri-ministerial effort of Ministries of Women and Child Development, Health & Family Welfare and Human Resource Development. The key elements of the scheme include nation-wide awareness and advocacy campaign and multi- sectoral action, initially started in select 100 districts (low on CSR) and got expanded to 61 additional districts in 2015-16. Considering the encouraging results of implementation in 161 districts the Government of India has expanded the BBBP Scheme in all 640 districts (as per census 2011) of the Country on 8th March, 2018. The 405 districts are covered through Multi - sectoral intervention, Media & Advocacy and 235 districts are covered through alert Media & Advocacy outreach. Multi-sectoral intervention includes effective enforcement of Pre Conception & Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PC&PNDT) Act 1994, Pre-Natal/ Post Natal care of mother, improve enrolment of girls in schools, community engagement/ training/ awareness generation etc.   (b)  Yes, Sir.  The Siddharth Nagar District has been selected under the Multi-Sectoral Activities component of the Scheme on 8th March, 2018.  Since then the District accomplished and implemented many activities to sensitize the mind set of local population towards the importance of girl child viz. Media Workshop, capacity building training programme for every segment of the society, organized rally, kanya janmotsav, pasting awareness posters on buses and important places in the districts.  The latest reports as per Health Management Information System (HMIS) data of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) show that  the district fared well in the F.Y. 2018-19 by improving in the registration of pregnant women for ante natal care during the first trimester of pregnancy and institutional deliveries by 3% and 1 % respectively from the previous F.Y. 2017-18.  The Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) at 892 (number of female live birth against 1000 male birth) showed improvement of four points during 2018-19 in comparison to 888 in previous F.Y. 2017-18.(c) It has been included in the 405 districts where multi sectoral intervention is being taken apart from media advocacy & outreach activity. (d) The overall target and objective of the Scheme is to improve declining Child Sex Ratio in the country and create an enabling environment for the education of girl child and this requires long-term attitudinal change. The key indicator to achieve this target is to improve the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB). The latest reports on State/UT-wise SRB data of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health & Family welfare (MoHFW) for the time period between F.Y. 2015-16 & 2018-19, reveal that SRB from 923 to 931 is showing improving trends at National level. While at State/UT level, SRB in 21 States/UTs are showing improving trends whereas 3 States/UT are stable in comparison of previous F.Y. 2017-18.
