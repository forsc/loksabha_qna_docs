ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (b) The powers of Highway Administration were delegated to Officers of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) vide Gazette Notification dated 16.09.2019. All encroachments brought to the notice of the Authority are processed as per rules of Highway Administration by the concerned offices.      The encroachment identified by the Highway Administration is to be removed with the assistance of the State Administration and the State Police Authorities. The role of the Highway Administration is limited to issuing of orders in this regard and providing support to the State Authorities in removal of the encroachments. (c) The provision of fencing/boundary wall along the Right of Way (ROW) of the National Highways is generally adopted in Greenfield alignments of the expressways. Generally non/partially access controlled National Highways do not have the provision of fencing/ boundary wall along the ROW throughout the project length but it is only limited to specific locations specified in the contract/ concession agreement. Further, efforts are made for provision of the Road Boundary Stones/Pillars as part of scope of the contractor/ concessionaire so as to demarcate the Right of Way. (d) The regular drives under the supervision of NHAI Regional Officers and Project Directors are conducted to identify the encroachments along the National Highways and reported to the State Authorities for taking necessary action in this regard. *****
