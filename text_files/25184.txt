                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e) :  With the aim of making the best of our skilled workforce returning due to the  pandemic, the Government of India launched an initiative SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) to conduct a skill mapping exercise of the returning workers under the Vande Bharat Mission. SWADES, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of External Affairs, aimed to create a database of qualified citizens based on their skill sets and experience to tap into and fulfill demand of Indian and foreign companies. It was aimed at all the citizens from all over the world, across ECR and ECNR categories. This was done to facilitate reintegration of migrant workers into the labour market and promote effective employment opportunities. For facilitating employment opportunities, details of SWADES registrations have been integrated with Skill India’s ASEEM (Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping) portal which was launched on 10 July 2020. Further, all data regarding Indians returning under Vande Bharat Mission was also shared with relevant State Governments, on a real time basis.*******
