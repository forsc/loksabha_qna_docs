As per the Rules, the generators of waste,including plastic packaging waste, have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter the plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorized by the local bodies. The rules also mandate the responsibilities of local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste. The rules mandate the producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.(b) and (c) It is estimated that around 25,940 Tonne per day of plastic waste is generated in the country, out of which about 60% waste is collected and recycled by the plastic recycling industries, therefore, there is no separate landfill area occupied by the plastic waste. However, the mixed municipal solid waste reaching the dumping sites contains plastic as well.With regard to existing landfill sites, the Rules provide criteria for closure and rehabilitation of old dumps. The solid waste dumps which have reached their full capacity have to be closed and rehabilitated by reducing the waste by bio mining and waste processing followed by placement of residues in new landfills or capping.In order to reduce and eliminate landfills, 94.77% of door-to-door collection of waste and 71.97% of source segregation of waste has been achieved by the Urban Local Bodies across the country. Plastic including plastic packaging segregated in such manner are given for safe disposal that inter-alia includes recycling, co-processing in cement plants, road construction etc. (d) to (f) MoHUA is implementing the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) (SBM-U) project under which various projects have been taken up. Under this programme during the mission period of 2014-15 to 2019-20, an allocation of Rs. 7424.24 Cr has been madefor Solid Waste Management Projects, which also include plastic waste. An amount of Rs 5024.45 Cr has been released to the State Governments till November, 2019.No proposal from the State Government of Kerala is pending with the Union Government.The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 defines the norms for compostable plastic as an ecologically sustainable and green alternatives of plastics.
