In Central Universities and Sanskrit Higher Education Institutions fully funded by the Central and State/ Union Territory Governments the sanctioned strength of Teacher Student Ratio is 1:28. However, in these institutions there is shortage of 809 regular teachers due to which actual Teacher Student Ratio is 1:52. The shortage of regular teachers is met by engaging Guest / Part-time faculty till the posts are filled on regular basis.  The Government has launched a special drive to fill up vacancies in academic posts in all academic institutions.                                       *****
