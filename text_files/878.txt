However, rationalization of train services, review of stoppages, augmentation/review of composition and review of timings is an on-going process on Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility.  Revision of time table is an annual process and revised time-tables are  published afresh every year. Indian Railways consistently endeavour to operate train services punctually, for which purpose, train running is monitored at the Divisional, Zonal and Railway Board level on a daily basis.*****
