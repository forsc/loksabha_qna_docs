(c) to (e) Under the project on “Semen Sexing in Cattle”, the following technologies have been standardized by ICAR: 1)	Selection of high fertile bulls with more than 50% conception rate at an early age through technologies like Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) of testicular tissue, use of Ultrasonography and Infrared Thermography 2)	Reduction of sperm dose (from 20 million to 5 million) per straw (0.25 ml) without compromising fertility (more than 40% conception rate) in indigenous and crossbred cattle and Murrah buffaloes.  In addition, a project entitled “Targeted immobilisation of Y-bearing spermatozoa and modulation of oviduct milieu for skewing sex ratio towards female offspring in dairy cattle” has also been sanctioned by ICAR for funding through National Agriculture Science Fund (NASF) to Southern Research Station, ICAR-NDRI at Bengaluru for a period of three years (2018-2021).
