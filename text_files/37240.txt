ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): Government of India’s goal is to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub by broadening and deepening our electronic manufacturing ecosystem. The major impediments faced by the electronics hardware manufacturing sector in the country are as under:(i)  Information Technology Agreement and FTAs: Electronics was the first sector to be opened up and which accepted zero duty regime for large number of products. As a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA-1) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), India has implemented zero duty regime on 217 tariff lines. Under the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the import of electronics hardware from the FTA countries such as ASEAN, Korea and Japan is allowed at a duty which is lower than the normal duty rate. Thus, there is limited protection to the electronics industry in the country.(ii)  Disability costs in domestic manufacturing: The electronics manufacturing sector faces several disabilities which render domestic manufacturing less competitive vis-a-viz other countries. The three factors which pose challenges to Indian manufacturers are infrastructure, power, and finance. Infrastructure challenges arise from poor supply chain logistics and inadequate ready availability of land. Finance costs in India are typically 5 to 6 percentage points above international rates. Power supply has improved much in the few years but it still remains unreliable and costly in many parts of the country.(iii)  Diversity and velocity of technology change: Electronics is pervasive and permeates all sectors of the economy. Therefore, the development of the sector involves domain knowledge of each of the sectors which it serves. The technologies in the electronics sector changes rapidly and currently it is estimated to be even less than six months in certain verticals. Convergence between different technologies, devices, software, and hardware are also driving technology changes.(c) and (d): Steps taken by the Government to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub by broadening and deepening our electronic manufacturing ecosystem, are annexed********AnnexureSteps taken by the Government to promote the electronics hardware manufacturing sector in the country 1.
