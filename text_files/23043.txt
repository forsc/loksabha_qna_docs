                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (f): 13 Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) have been approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on 03.08.2016 for the upgradation under Phase-IV of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Details of GMCs are at Annexure.The cost approved for each GMC is Rs. 200 crore with Central share of Rs. 120 crore and State share of Rs. 80 crore. The Ministry, while finalizing the up-gradation projects, gives priority to the States generally considered “backward” with respect to the broad socio-economic indicators. As upgradation projects are jointly funded, commitment of the State Government in terms of providing state share of funds, encumbrance free land, water & power supply and statutory clearances is also essential.
