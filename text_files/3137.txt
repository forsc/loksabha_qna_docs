ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)  Government follows zero tolerance policy to cross-border terrorism. Necessary measures are taken to prevent and deter cross-border terrorist infiltration. Close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies at the Centre and the State level is maintained in order to avert terror incidents in the country. The Multi Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it function on 24x7 basis for real time collection and sharing of intelligence with other Agencies and State Governments. With a view to enhance the capacity of State forces, the Central Agencies have been organizing training programmes for the State forces on intelligence sharing and investigation of terrorism cases. Many States have raised special forces to deal with terrorism. Central Armed Police Forces and National Security Guards have also been stationed at different locations to assist the States in dealing with such incidents.(b) to (d)	The Government has conveyed to Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an atmosphere free from terror, hostility and violence. The onus is on Pakistan for creating such an environment.The Government has consistently raised the issue of  cross border terrorism and placed high emphasis on international cooperation in combating the menace of terrorism including in bilateral, regional and international fora. As a result of Government’s persistent efforts, international community has shown understanding of India’s position. There is enhanced concern in the international community at terrorism emanating from Pakistan, including the continuing activities of internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals including Jamaat-ud Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen. This was manifest in the international support after the cross border terrorist attack in Pulwama in February 2019. Major partner countries have also called on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to terrorist groups operating from territories under its control and take meaningful action against these groups. In the aftermath of the cross-border terror attack in Pulwama, UN Security Council condemned in the strongest term, the heinous and cowardly act. Many terrorist entities and individuals who find shelter in Pakistan and are also engaged in terrorism against India have been proscribed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union and other countries. On 01 May 2019, the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee designated Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad as a UN proscribed terrorist. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at its Plenary in June 2018, notified Pakistan in the ‘Grey List’ due to continuing terror financing related concerns, including with respect to the UN proscribed terrorist entities like LeT, JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation. These vindicate India’s consistent stand that internationally designated terrorist groups and individuals continue to operate from and raise financial resources with impunity in Pakistan, and use territories under its control for carrying out cross-border terrorism in India and elsewhere in South Asia. India’s call to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestation; zero tolerance to terrorism; rejection of any justification for an act of terror; delinking terror from religion; need for all forces believing in humanity to unite in fight against terrorism has found greater acceptance among the international community, and is reflected in a number of outcome documents issued after bilateral Summit meetings with various countries, and at regional and multilateral fora, such as Shangai Cooperation Organization; G20; BRICS, among others. ***
