Though this question was transferred by this ministry to them for acceptance, in the meantime it has been admitted and indicated against the name of this Ministry therefore, Facts as obtained from Legislative Department regarding the question are reproduced below:-(a)	to (c) Legislative Department does not maintain any such database or register on PLCP compliance. However, this Department has already issued the guidelines for Pre-legislative Consultation based on the Policy formulated by the Committee on Secretaries, which should invariably be followed by all the Ministries/Departments before any legislative proposal is submitted to the Cabinet for its consideration and approval. However, the committee of Secretaries has also taken decision that if the Department/ Ministry concerned is of the view that it is not feasible or desirable to hold pre-legislative consultation, it may record the reasons in the note for the Cabinet, which is available on the website of legislative Department (http://legislative.gov.in/documents/pre-legislative-consultation-policy). *****
