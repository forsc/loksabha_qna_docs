ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b) Speeding up of Mail/Express trains and converting trains into superfast services thereby levying applicable charges is an ongoing process on Indian Railways. Accordingly, during the year 2018-19, 11309/11310 Solapur-Miraj Express has been converted into superfast and is being operated as 22155/22156 Solapur-Miraj Superfast Express w.e.f. 07.06.2018. Similarly, 11051/11052 Solapur-Shri Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj (T) Express and 19061/19062 Bandra (T)-Ramnagar Express are being converted into superfast w.e.f. 01.07.2019.(c) & (d) Punctuality of passenger carrying trains including Superfast trains and Premium trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Humsafar, Tejas etc. is being monitored rigorously on a daily basis at Divisional, Zonal and Railway Board levels by Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs), General Managers (GMs) and Railway Board Members and Senior officers. Efforts are made to ensure right time starts at originating station and also to maintain punctuality at enroute halting stations. To ensure running of these trains right time when pairing trains are running late, scratch rakes are inducted and rakes are standardized to the extent operationally feasible. Also, various steps have been initiated to improve punctuality such as prioritization of preventive maintenance of assets to minimize asset failures, capacity enhancement projects by construction of additional loop lines at stations, doubling, construction of third line corridors, automatic signaling, construction of limited height subways to replace level crossings, Road Under Bridges (RUB) and Road Over Bridges (ROB) etc. Besides, punctuality drives are launched from time to time and staff involved in train operations are sensitized. In addition, Zonal Railways have also been advised to have better coordination with Civil and Police authorities of States to deal with situations arising out of law and order problems.*****
