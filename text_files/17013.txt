All promotional schemes of the Department, are Central Sector Schemes, hence, details of amount spent on these schemes are not maintained either State/UT-wise or sports-wise.   (d): The progress of expenditure on funds allocated to various schemes of the Department for development of sports is monitored by calling reports periodically, having meetings with representatives of States/Union Territories/National Sports Federations (NSFs), visits by Officers wherever possible, etc. with a view to reach the benefit of schemes to actual beneficiaries.    (e): “Sports” being a State subject, the primary responsibility for development and promotion of sports rests with the respective State/UT Government. Department of Sports supplements efforts of the State/UT Government through its various schemes which are equally applicable to the whole country irrespective of any specific State/UT. The details of steps taken at the level of Central Government for development/promotion of sports in the country under various sports promotional schemes are at Annexure-II.   (f): SAI does not allocate the funds district-wise. However, one coach is posted in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh and expenditure on salary is being met by SAI. *****
