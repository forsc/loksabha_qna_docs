 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (b):  Coal-based generation percentage to the total generation of electricity in 2018-19  was 79.0 % as compared to 78.9 % in 2017-18.  (c)        Ministry of Coal releases fund to coal companies under the scheme "Conservation and Safety and Infrastructure Development in Coal Mines" as payment against collection of cess (excise duty) on coal and coke for conservation and development related work including infrastructure development. This cess is a specific purpose levy under the Coal Mines (Conservation and Development) Act, 1975 which has now been subsumed under Goods and Services Tax. Releases under the scheme are classified as “subsidies” in the budget of the Ministry for technical reasons. Subsidy provided to coal industry under the central sector scheme of  "Conservation and Safety and Infrastructure Development in Coal Mines" was Rs. 182.40 Crore in 2018-19 in comparison to Rs. 499.50 Crore in 2017-18.  (d):       Not applicable in view of point (c).     ****
