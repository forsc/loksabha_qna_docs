Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) mobilise the eligible rural poor youth from different target districts and enroll them for training in the trade of their interest. After completion of the training, these PIAs support the youth in successful placement and provide post placement support to the candidates within or outside the State. There is a provision of providing placement to minimum 70% of the trained candidates.
