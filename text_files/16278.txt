ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), under the Ministry of Skill Development is responsible for implementation of CSCM (Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed) component of PMKVY(2016-20) program which is the flagship skill development scheme for all sections of the society including persons with disability (PwD) and fee based program through its affiliated and accredited training partners across country.  Under PMKVY (2016-20), there are incentives to encourage participation of PwDs in the skill training namely; post placement support, monthly conveyance allowance, boarding and lodging etc. There is an exclusive Sector Skill Council for PwD namely Skill Council for PwD (SCPwD) for catering to the needs of the PwD candidates and it runs training in PwD-friendly training centres. Such centres are structurally designed to enable PwD candidates to experience  beneficial training such as availability of Braille, computer screen reader for visually impaired, sign language interpreter for speech and hearing impaired at Training Centres. (b)	 National Skill Development Agency has been subsumed under National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) which has been notified by MSDE on 05th December, 2018 as an overarching regulatory body to establish minimum standards for the functioning of entities in both long and short term training. It, amongst others, anchors the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) and allied quality assurance mechanisms.In order to incorporate the needs of PwD in development of qualifications, a committee comprising of various stakeholders was set up in NSDA (now NCVET).  After several consultations the following decisions were taken:•	To include PwD component in the Qualification File Template.•	To add new sector in the NQR to reflect Qualifications being used for training of PwD.•	To invite (SCPwD) and Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DePwD), in stakeholder consultations of all job roles at NSDA (now NCVET), in order to obtain their inputs on the PwD amenability of job roles.(c)	Under NSDC Fee based program, 9,086 persons with disability (PwD) candidates have been trained in the last 3 years. 800 PwD candidates have been trained in Tamil Nadu. However, no PwD candidate has been trained in Karur district of Tamil Nadu in the last 2 year.Under PMKVY 2016-20, as on 17.03.2020, more than 40,000 PwD candidates have been trained out of which more than 1100 PwD candidates have been trained in the state of Tamil Nadu. However, no PwD candidate has been trained in Karur district of Tamil Nadu. The state-wise details of the PwD candidate trained, certified and reported placed is at Annexure-I.(d) & (e) 	National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) through its Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra’s (PMKKs) and other Training Partners conduct Rozgar melas on PAN India basis as it’s an ongoing process. In the light of the current ongoing Covid19 Pandemic, there are currently no plans to organise Rozgar Melas in Karur Parliamentary Constituency.
