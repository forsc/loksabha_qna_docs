ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country.  The target of completing 1,00,000 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under Phase-I of BharatNet was achieved in December, 2017. Subsequently, the workfront was increased to 1.25 lakh GPs in Phase-I. The work of connecting the remaining GPs of BharatNet is under progress. (b)	As part of BharatNet project, the Last Mile connectivity, through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology to access broadband /internet services, is to be provided at all the 2.5 lakh GPs in the country. Towards this end, provisioning of 2 Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) is under implementation in each of the GPs of BharatNet Phase-I. As of now, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed in 44,786 GPs.(c) &  (d)	The Union Cabinet on 19.07.2017 approved a modified strategy for implementing BharatNet which, inter-alia, includes providing broadband connectivity to all GPs by March 2019. As on 07.11.2019, by laying 3,80,988 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC), a total of 1,40,668 GPs have been connected, out of which 1,27,393 GPs have been made Service Ready. In addition, 983 GPs have been provided connectivity through satellite media. Implementation of BharatNet is very challenging as the project is of mega nature and the GPs are widely dispersed across the country in rural and remote areas. However, all out efforts are being made to expeditiously implement the project.(e)	The District-wise details are given in Annexure-I.
