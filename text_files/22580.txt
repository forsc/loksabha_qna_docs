The flood management and anti-erosion schemes are planned, investigated and implemented by State Governments with their own resources as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. The Government of India has been making continuous efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management. During XI Plan Government of India had launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) for providing Central Assistance to States for works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, anti-sea erosion, etc. which continued during XII Plan and thereafter as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21. Central assistance amounting to Rs.148.67 Crores has been released to State Governments of Bihar and West Bengal for various flood management/ anti erosion projects on river Ganga and Mahananda under FMP as per the Annexure I (c) & (d)  The Central Water Commission compiles flood damage data state-wise as reported by states and the district-wise data is not maintained centrally. However, it has been reported that State Government of Bihar is constructing new flood embankments about 1195.87 Km in length on either side of different rivers such as Mahananda, Mechl, Donk, Kankai and Ratwa in upper reach of Mahananda Basin under Mahananda Flood Management Scheme.  Similarly, for the construction of new embankment along the river Ganga for protecting Amdabad Block from soil erosion, land acquisition process has been taken up.***** ANNEXURE IAnnexure referred to Part (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.†*340 to be answered on 18.03.2021 regarding “Soil Erosion due to Floods”A.
