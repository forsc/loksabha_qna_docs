THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) & (b): 	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is one of the major drivers for economic growth of the country as it is one of the sources of non-debt finance for the country. FDI infuses long term sustainable capital in the economy and contributes towards technology transfer, development of strategic sectors, greater innovation, competition and employment creation amongst other benefits. FDI is not the only contributor to India’s significant present on the innovation map. Government has taken various initiatives/measures to build aatma-nirbharta and nurture innovation. Some of these include : 1. Startup India initiative: Startup India was launched with an aim to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship to drive sustainable economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities. The Government has made fast paced efforts towards making the vision of Startup India initiative a reality. Substantial progress has been made under the initiative, which has stirred entrepreneurial spirit across the country. The details of various programs undertaken by the Government to promote startups across the country under Startup India initiative are placed as Annexure I. 2. Production Linked Incentives (PLIs): For enhancing India’s Manufacturing Capabilities and Enhancing Exports, the PLI Scheme in the 14 key sectors were introduced, with the objective to make Indian manufacturers globally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology, ensure efficiencies, create economies of scale, enhance exports and make India an integral part of the global supply chain. 3. Measures to boost Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Filing – with adoption of National IPR policy in 2016, the Government has taken several initiatives to encourage innovation in the country through spreading awareness about importance and need to protect valuable IPR, appropriate legislative amendments to improve and expedite the processing of IPR applications, reduction in various fees to boost filing from startups, MSMEs, educational institutes, and various infrastructural measures including adoption of IT and technology. As result of these measures, India’s rank in Global Innovation Index has improved from 81 in 2015 to 46 in 2021. 4. Taxation benefits: Government has provided various tax incentives for promoting R&D. These includes allowance for expenses (both revenue and capital) incurred for in-house scientific R&D where the research relates to the business of the entity undertaking such research. Deductions are also allowed for payments made to scientific research organizations, including approved research consortia, universities, colleges, or other research institutions. Apart from the income tax incentives, government also provides benefits of concessional customs duty, and goods and services tax (GST) for research purposes. 5.  Corporate Social responsibility (CSR): CSR has been made mandatory through provisions under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013. Under the law, a company needs to spend at least 2% of their average net profit made during the 3 immediately preceding financial years for CSR activities. The scope of CSR for private companies has been expanded to allow them to support research and innovation by the Government-funded incubators, or agencies funded by central and State Governments or public state utilities.*******
