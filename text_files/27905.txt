ANSWER




	ANSWERTHE MINISTER  FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING (SHRI PURUSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) and (b) The Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) does not have any collaboration with Eco Health Alliance. However, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has proposed partnering with the Department to contribute towards the latter’s efforts for the benefit of small scale producers in India by providing technical assistance, programme design and support DAHD’s mandate that include (i)	deployment of technologies to support livestock production, health and systems (ii)	establishing national ‘One Health’ priorities and intersection of livestock and human health issues, including inter-ministerial coordination (iii)	livestock sector planning, analytical and research capacity, including sustaining investment from public and private sector (iv)	programmes to improve sector productivity focusing on traceability of livestock and livestock products, value addition of livestock products, marketing solutions (like e-platforms), disease reporting and digital infrastructure to promote integration and growth in the sector. It is gathered that Eco Health Alliance was selected by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for provision of this technical support initially, due to their global partnership with OIE, WHO and FAO. However, the transition from that alliance has been made considering the need for a domestic partner to understand country context and local needs. *****
