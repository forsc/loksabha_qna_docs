ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS[GEN. (DR.) V. K. SINGH (RETD.)] (a)  Details of ongoing works of National Highways including expressways at present in the country, State-wise including Tamil Nadu are at Annexure-I. (b)   These projects shall optimize the efficiency of freight and passenger movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. These roads include development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridor and Feeder Corridor, National Corridor Efficiency Improvement, Border and International connectivity roads, Coastal and Port connectivity roads and Green-field expressways.  These roads run through the length and breadth of the country, connect adjacent countries, the National Capital with State Capital and the State Capitals mutually, major ports, non-major ports, large industrial centers or tourist centers, meet very important strategic requirement in hilly and isolated areas, help opening up large tracts of backward area and hilly regions (other than strategically important ones) which enable sizeable reduction in travel time & distance. (c) & (d). There are 778 delayed projects (National Highways including expressways) under this ministry. Details of these projects are given at Annexure-II. These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. These projects are given time period of 2 to 3 years for completion.
