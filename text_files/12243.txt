ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) 	Fire prone forest areas of different severity classes have been mapped in the grids of 5 km x 5km based on the frequency of forest fires and published in the India State of Forest Report, 2019. The analysis reveals that 21.40% of the forest cover of the country is highly to extremely fire prone. However as reported by the States, an area of 93,273 ha only has been affected by fire in 2019 in India. Most of forest fires in the country are ground fires in which ground vegetation, etc. get burnt. The number of incidents of forest fire in the country varies from year to year depending on various natural and anthropogenic reasons. Since forests are managed by the States and UTs, the responsibility of forest fire prevention and management lies primarily with the respective State/UT. The Ministry supports the efforts of States and UTs in prevention and control of forest fire by providing financial assistance for various forest fire prevention and management measures under the Centrally Sponsored Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme. Accordingly, State/UTs prepare Annual Plan of Operation for prevention and management of forest fire under this scheme and submit to the Ministry for funding approval.In addition to above, Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules 2018 allow the use of CAMPA fund by States and UTs for capacity building, providing appropriate firefighting equipment to forest fire fighting squads and activities for forest fire management.Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has prepared a National Action Plan on Forest Fire in 2018 after several rounds of consultation with all the States and UTs. The objective of this Plan is to minimize forest fires by informing, enabling and empowering forest-fringe communities and incentivizing them to work in tandem with the State Forest Departments. The Plan also intends to substantially reduce the vulnerability of forests across diverse forest ecosystems in the country against fire hazards, enhance capabilities of forest personnel and institutions in fighting fires, and speed-up recovery after a fire event.Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry disseminates real-time satellite-based forest fire alerts to State/UT Forest Departments and other registered mobile users whenever forest fires are detected.The Ministry is the nodal Ministry for disaster management caused by forest fire in the country. Nodal Officers for forest fire prevention and control have also been appointed in all States and UTs. A Crisis Management Committee has been constituted in the Ministry under the chairmanship of Secretary, MoEF&CC. For supervision and review of forest fire management, a Central Monitoring Committee has been constituted in the ministry under the chairmanship of Secretary MoEF&CC while Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of all States and Union Territories are members of this Committee. *****
