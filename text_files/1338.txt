                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)	In the pre-2020 period, India announced its voluntary goal to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. According to the second Biennial Update Report submitted by Government of India to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2018, India has achieved 21 per cent reduction in emission intensity between 2005 and 2014. Under the Paris Agreement, India submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to UNFCCC outlining eight targets for post-2020 period, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF), and (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The other targets pertain to sustainable lifestyles; climate friendly growth path; climate change adaptation; climate finance; and technology and capacity building.(b)	and (c) The NDC goals have to be achieved between 2021 and 2030. As part of its climate action agenda, Government of India is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) comprising eight Missions namely National Solar Mission, National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, National Water Mission, National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system, National Mission for a “Green India”, National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture and National Mission on Strategic knowledge for Climate Change. Further, 33 States and Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC to address their State specific action. The Government is also supporting adaptation actions of States and Union Territories through National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change.*****
