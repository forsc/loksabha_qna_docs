MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a) & (b): The details of total number of sanctioned and vacant positions for Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant professors and the category wise break-up thereof, in Central Universities under the purview of this Ministry are given at Annexure.(c) & (d): Vacancies in positions sanctioned for OBCs at various levels are caused by dynamic processes attributed, inter-alia, to retirements, resignations, deaths, deputations, expansion and opening of new institutions. Occurring of vacancies and filling up is a continuous process. Ministry of Education and University Grants Commission (UGC) continuously monitor it with Universities. UGC vide its D.O. letter No.F.1-14/2019 (CPP-II) dated 4th June, 2019 UGC has prepared the Guidelines for Recruitment of Faculty in Universities, Colleges and Institutions Deemed to be Universities outlining the selection procedure and the time frame for recruitment which has been circulated to all Universities to adhere the guidelines. The Universities have also been requested to take steps to ensure that the vacancies in the Universities as well as in the Colleges affiliated to the Universities are filled up at the earliest. However, the onus of filling up the teaching posts lies on Central Universities which are autonomous bodies created under Acts of Parliament. *****
