The State/UT-wise distribution is placed at Annexure.(c) to (e) Employment generation coupled with improving employability of the youth is the priority concern of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme run by Ministry of Rural Development and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) run by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has been initiated by Government inter alia, for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans upto Rs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. Upto 1st November 2019, 20.83 crore loans were sanctioned under the scheme.	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is the flagship scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE). The objective of this Skill Certification Scheme is to enable a large number of Indian youth to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood.	ASPIRE (A scheme for promotion of Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship) was launched to set up a network of technology centres and to set up incubation centres to accelerate entrepreneurship in agro-industry.The individuals trained under the ASPIRE scheme of Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (M/oMSME) can become agri-enterpreneurs/entrepreneurs and can seek financial support under different schemes of the Govt. including Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) under which loans are provided by banks and subsidy to the extent of 15-35% is given by the Govt. of India.  Individuals can also seek employment in the related industry or can seek further higher skills/training.	Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched with the objective to incentivise employers for creation of employment. Under the scheme, Government of India is paying Employer’s full contribution i.e. 12% towards EPF and EPS both (as admissible from time to time) for a period of three years to the new employees through EPFO. The beneficiaries registered upto 31st March, 2019 will receive the benefit for 3 years from the date of registration under the scheme.	Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/ Departments/ States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment.*****
