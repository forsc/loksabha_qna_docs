ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (d): With regard to the amount of loans written off by PSBs in Jharkhand since 2014 till date, bank-wise, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stated that data in this regard are not maintained by it.With regard to the total number of persons in Jharkhand who have got undue advantage of loan write-off, it is stated that as borrowers of written-off loans continue to be liable for repayment and the process of recovery of dues from the borrower in written-off loan accounts continues, write-off does not benefit the borrower.With regard to the details of loans of farmers in Jharkhand that have been written off, RBI has apprised that information is not maintained by it. However, as per RBI data on domestic operations, the amounts written-off for Agriculture and Allied activities, as reported by PSBs to RBI at the end of the financial years (FYs) 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (up to 31.12.2019, provisional data) were Rs. 2,833 crore, Rs. 6,361 crore, Rs. 7,091 crore, Rs. 9,589 crore, Rs. 12,491 crore and Rs. 6,760 crore respectively.*****
