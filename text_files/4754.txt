The policy also encourages plantation of trees alongside roads, railway lines, rivers, streams, canals etc. under social forestry. The MoEF&CC is supporting State/UT Governments to take up afforestation programmes under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM). Afforestation activities are also being taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) and Compensatory Afforestation Fund. Further the plantation activities outside forest areas like agro forestry/ farm forestry /social forestry including massive plantation on all such lands are also being carried out cross-sectorally by various departments, Ministries, NGOs, Civil Society, Corporate etc., under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes and also under different State Plan/Non Plan Schemes including Externally Aided Projects.With a view to promote tree plantation on unused Railway land along the Railway tracks and along the National Highways, Model Agreements were also issued by the Ministry to all States/UTs for entering into the agreements with concerned Railway Zones in States and NHAI respectively for greening of such unused government lands.  The concerned State Forest Departments are taking up plantation activity on railway land in States like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu, etc.Green Highways (Plantation, Transplantation, Beautification& Maintenance) Policy-2015 of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways alsopromotes plantations along National Highways.
