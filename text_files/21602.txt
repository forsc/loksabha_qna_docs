ANSWER




                                                        (a):  The expenditure of Department of Health Research (DHR) ranged from 2.89% to 3.5% of that of Department of Health & Family Welfare in the last five years.(b) & (c):  The allocation has been lower as compared to the allocations for similar Departments engaged in research, namely, Department of Agricultural Research & Education (DARE), Department of Science & Technology (DST) and Department of Scientific & Industrial Research (DSIR).	The Department of Health Research was created as a new Department in 2007-08 and its full-fledged working started from 2013-14 after the roll out of various schemes for infrastructure development and human resource & capacity development for promotion of health research in the country. Since then, with the increase in the activities and research programmes of DHR-Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the allocation and expenditure has been increasing every year. The expenditure of Department of Health Research has increased from Rs.564.56 crores in 2008-09 to Rs.1808.03 crores in 2019-20.(d) & (e): The Department has created research infrastructure for promoting health research activities, undertaken health research activities in infectious and non-communicable diseases, trained human resources and has contributed significant interventions for containing infectious disease outbreaks/ epidemics, including COVID-19 pandemic.  Thus, there has been a gradual increase in the allocation for the Department of Health Research from Rs. 567 crores in RE 2008-09 to Rs.4062.30 crores in RE 2020-21, which also includes Rs.2100 crores of Emergency COVID-19 package.
