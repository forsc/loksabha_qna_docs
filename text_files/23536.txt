                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	The existing provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 are considered sufficient to deal with the cases of insult to Indian National Flag, Constitution of India and the National Anthem of India. -2-L.S.US.Q. No. 4472 FOR 23.03.2021(c)  & (d):	Complaints relating to the incidents of the disrespect of National Flag and National Anthem are also received in the Ministry of Home Affairs. Since the offence of disrespect of National Flag and National Anthem is punishable under section 2 and section 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, these complaints are forwarded to the concerned State/Union Territory Government for taking action as per law, as the onus of implementation of the said Act lies with authorities under whose jurisdiction the alleged act of disrespect has taken place. Details of registration of police complaints are not maintained in the Ministry of Home Affairs.  However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has been issuing advisories, from time to time, to all State/Union territory Governments to strictly comply with the provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. ******
