                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) Yes, Sir. On 30.06.2019, M/s Air India Express B737 aircraft VT-AYA while operating flight from Dubai to Mangaluru met with an incident of runway overrun during landing at Mangaluru. ;On 30.06.2019, M/s Spicejet Q400 aircraft VT-SUM while operating flight Bhopal to Surat met with an incident of runway overrun during landing at Surat.;(b) Yes, Sir. Both these occurrences have been classified as serious incidents by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau(AAIB) and are being investigated under Rule 11(1) of the Aircraft (Accident and Incident Investigation) Rules 2017.;(c) The details of measures taken to ensure air safety are at Annexure A.;(d) Runway expansion at Mangaluru is not feasible due to huge land fillings, high cost and operational challenges.;(e) & (f) Yes, Sir. A representation was received from Shri J.R Lobo, Hon''ble MLA, Mangaluru to construct a new runway at Mangaluru airport for wide bodied aircraft proposing to use the existing runway for smaller aircrafts. The proposal was not found feasible owing to ''dependent operation'' of the proposed new runway on the existing runway, rehabilitation of project affected parties and high cost of construction. It was found that despite these interventions the runway capacity would be enhanced marginally only.
