ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a): As per the latest information received from State Governments, State-wise Per Capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) at current and constant (2011-12) prices for 2015-16 to 2017-18 are given in Annexure.(b):  The Per Capita Net Value Added (NVA) for rural and urban area is estimated only for the Base-Year of National Account, and is given below:                   Per Capita Net Value Added (NVA) (in Rs.)                        Year	    Rural	Urban                       2011-12	   40,925	98,435 (c): Government is focusing on inclusive growth as reflected in its commitment of Sabka Saath,  Sabka Vikas. Various steps have been taken to address the rural urban disparity. “Gaon, Gareeb aur Kisan” has been at the centre of government policies. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Pension Yojana, small and marginal farmers will get a minimum fixed pension of Rs 3,000 per month on attaining the age of 60 years. The Government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-Kisan) with the objective of supplementing the financial needs of farmers in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income. The Government is also providing boost to the farmers’ income through Minimum Support Price (MSPs). The ‘Scheme of Fund for Upgradation and Regeneration of Traditional Industries’ (SFURTI) aims to set up more Common Facility Centers (CFCs) to facilitate cluster based development of Bamboo, Honey and Khadi. The Government is also encouraging private entrepreneurs in agriculture and also focusing on agricultural infrastructure. The zero-budget farming, as a model for farmers is being considered and would help in doubling the farmers’ income.  The Government will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure economies of scale for farmers access to inputs and markets. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) aims to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022. The Government’s rural road scheme has brought about socio-economic improvements. Under phase three of PM Gram Sadak Yojana, 1.25 lakh kms of road is to be built in the next five years.                                             *****
