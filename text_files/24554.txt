ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):   Government has recently announced  Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 14 mandated kharif crops including paddy, pulses, oilseeds and cereals on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.                    The Government in its Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at a level of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19 onwards (Annex).(d) to (f):   Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. While recommending its price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. The costs include all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for in land, expenses incurred in cash and kind on the use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.             In addition to cost of production CACP also considers various other factors while recommending MSP which include overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, likely effect of price policy on rest of economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production.            CACP also consult various stakeholders including Farmer’s association while recommending MSP.           Government has taken a “multi pronged approach” to double the farmer’s income which include reducing input costs; ensuring fair price for the produce; reducing wastage; and creating alternate sources of income among others. The Government has been implementing/reorienting various schemes to address the above mentioned key areas which include Soil Health Card (SHC), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) , e NAM, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’(PM-AASHA) among others.
