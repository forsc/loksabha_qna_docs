                                                        (a)       Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) was launched in 2015. Presently, the third phase of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 is being implemented across the country.

(b)       Under PMKVY, short term training is being imparted through skill development Training Centres (TCs) including Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs). The TCs are accredited and affiliated through single online platform i.e. Skill India Portal (SIP). Further, Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode throughout the country, including State of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.
