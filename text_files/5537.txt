                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) 	Yes, sir. India’s share in world exports of fruits like apple, pear, peach, plum, apricot and cherry is very low. These fruits are grown in temperate climates and in India can be grown only in specific regions. As such, the availability of exportable surplus of these fruits as well as availability of right quality, colour, size, texture and aroma of fruits, suitable for exports, is low.

The Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the administrative control of the Department of Commerce, has the mandate to promote exports of fruits. APEDA provides assistance to the exporters of fruits under various component of its scheme “Agriculture & Processed Food Export promotion Scheme of APEDA” viz.
