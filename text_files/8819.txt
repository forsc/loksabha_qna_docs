                        be pleased to state:-















(a) whether the action of identifying medicines under price control by a NITI Aayog Committee instead of National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) will weaken NPPA in fixing drug prices and regulating the prices of important drugs; and (b) if so, whether the Government is planning to take any steps to prevent the weakening of NPPA?






ANSWER




(a):	No, Sir. The NITI Aayog Committee is not identifying the medicines under price control. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare notifies the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). All the medicines specified in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) are included in the First Schedule of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013) and brought under price control by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). 	A Standing National Committee on Medicines (SNCM) has been constituted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in July, 2018 to review and revise the National list of Essential Medicines (NLEM) by way of additions and deletions in the existing NLEM in the context of contemporary knowledge of use of therapeutic products in health & hygiene of general public.(b):	In view of reply at (a) above, the question does not arise.*******
