In addition to this, the Act provides that pregnant women and lactating mothers and children in the age group of 6 months to 14 years are entitled to meals as per prescribed nutritional norms under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) schemes. Higher nutritional norms are prescribed for malnourished children upto 6 years of age. Accordingly, for children below 6 months of age, exclusive breastfeeding is promoted and for pregnant women and children in the age group of 6 months to 6 years, under the Anganwadi Services of the Umbrella ICDS Scheme, Supplementary Nutrition is provided in the form of Take Home Ration, Morning Snacks and Hot Cooked Meals. (c) & (d) Government of India has not proposed any mobile Maternity Homes and Neo-Natal Care Centres in the country as emergency obstetric care can not be adequately provided in mobile maternity homes ******
