                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a):  Yes, Sir.  The specifications of Organic Fertilizers viz City Compost, Vermi compost, Phosphate Rich Organic Manure (PROM), Organic Manure, Bio-enriched Organic Manure, Bone-Meal (Raw), Bone-Meal (Steamed) and Potash Derived from Rhodophytes have been notified in the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985.(b):	Government has been promoting chemical-free organic farming through Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) & Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) since 2015-16 to reduce the consumption of chemical fertilizer.  Under PKVY and MOVCDNER farmers are directly provided Rs. 31,000 and Rs. 32,500 respectively through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for organic inputs including on-farm production/procurement of organic fertilizer. Handholding & training on on-farm production of organic input including organic fertilizers and its use are also the integral part of this scheme. Government is also promoting Natural farming to reduce the consumption of chemical fertilizer through Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP) as a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2020-21 by supporting traditional indigenous practices. The scheme mainly emphasizes on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching, use of cow dung-urine formulations and plant-based preparations. Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis.
