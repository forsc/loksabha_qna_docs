                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) Rural Roads’ is a State subject and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network. The details of length of roads constructed under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) since its inception in 2000, year-wise and State-wise are given in Annexure-I. The details of road length constructed under PMGSY year-wise and district-wise in the State of Bihar are given at Annexure-II.(b) As per the programme guidelines, Maintenance of rural roads constructed under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is the responsibility of the State Government. The State Governments are required to undertake the maintenance of the entire Core Network, particularly the road works constructed/upgraded under the PMGSY. All road works constructed under PMGSY are covered by initial five year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. During the routine maintenance period, the road is to be maintained to the serviceable standards as defined in chapter 11 of the Rural Roads Manual SP 20 (2002) and as per the maintenance specifications contained in Ministry of Rural Development specifications for Rural roads 2014.  On expiry of this 5 year post construction maintenance, PMGSY roads are required to be placed under Zonal maintenance contracts consisting of 5 year maintenance including renewal as per cycle, from time to time. The details of expenditure incurred by the State on maintenance of roads constructed under PMGSY are not maintained centrally as of now.(c) The details of road length constructed per year since 2000 as also rate of construction per day is given at Annexure-III. (d) to (e)	The annual targets and achievements of the States with regard to providing all weather connectivity to eligible and feasible habitations during last three years are given at Annexure-IV. Implementation of PMGSY is lagging behind in few States primarily due to following reasons:- (i) Short working season;(ii) Scarcity of construction material;(iii) Difficult terrain;(iv) Most remote habitations remaining for connectivity;(v) Climate change and unpredictable adverse weather in recent years;(v) Inadequate execution and contracting capacityThe Ministry of Rural Development is constantly monitoring the implementation of the PMGSY for providing all-weather road connectivity to all the eligible and feasible habitations at the earliest.******
