ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES[SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR]a)	There are 316 Community Radio Stations (CRS) operational in the country as on date. A State/UT-wise list, reflecting the number of CR Stations, is available on Ministry’s website www.mib.gov.in.b)	No Sir.c)	The number of Letters of Intent (LOI) issued, till 31st December, 2020, to(i) Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) is 401;(ii) Educational Institutions (Private) is 164;(iii) Government Institutions is 182; and(iv) Others is 1d)	Yes Sir. The Policy Guidelines for setting up Community Radio Stations in India prescribe that within one month of issue of Letter of Intent (LOI), the applicant will be required to apply to the Wireless Planning & Coordination (WPC) Wing of Ministry of Communications for frequency allocation and clearance from Standing Advisory Committee on radio Frequency Allocation (SACFA). A time frame of six months, from the date of application, is prescribed for issue of SACFA clearance. On receipt of SACFA clearance, the LOI holder is required to apply for signing of Grant of Permission Agreement (GOPA) to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, along with requisite Bank Guarantee. Further, within three months of receipt of all clearances i.e., signing of GOPA, the permission holder shall set up the Community Radio Station.e)	The Policy Guidelines for setting up Community Radio Stations in India provide that failure to comply with the prescribed time schedule shall make the LOI/GOPA holder liable for cancellation of its LOI/GOPA and forfeiture of the Bank Guarantee. The Policy Guidelines do not prescribe the mechanism to be followed for cancellation of LOI/GOPA. The proposal for cancellation of LOI, however, is placed before the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), that is constituted under the Policy Guidelines for grant of LOI, which takes an appropriate decision.So far, 104 LOIs have been cancelled.f)	Several measures have been taken by the Government to start more Community Radio Stations (CRS) in urban and rural areas in the country. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has pursued with Central Ministries, National Disaster Management Authority and State/UT Governments, to motivate eligible organizations to apply for CRS permission, especially in Aspirational Districts, North East region and disaster-prone areas. Further, the Government of India has approved a Central Sector Scheme namely “Supporting Community Radio Movement in India”. Under the scheme, Community Radio awareness workshops are organized from time to time to spread awareness about Community Radio Policy Guidelines in urban and rural areas in the country and infrastructure support grant is provided to the licensee organization.****
