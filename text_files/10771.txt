Section 15 (Punishment for storage of pornographic material involving child) has been amended as below:Section 15 (1): Any person,  who  stores  or  possesses  pornographic  material  in  any form involving a child, but fails to delete or destroy or report the same to the designated authority, as may be prescribed, with an intention to share or transmit child pornography, shall  be  liable  to  fine  not  less  than  five  thousand  rupees,  and  in  the  event  of second or subsequent offence, with fine which shall not be less than ten thousand rupees.Section 15(2): Any person, who stores or possesses pornographic material in any form involving a child for transmitting or propagating or displaying or distributing in any manner at any time except for the purpose of reporting, as may be prescribed, or for use as evidence in court, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.Section 15(3): Any person, who  stores or possesses pornographic material in any  form involving a child for commercial purpose shall be punished on the first conviction with imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than three years which  may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both, and in the event of second or  subsequent  conviction, with imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than five years which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.The details of the number of persons who have been booked and charged for the offence of Child Pornography during 2015-2017 is at Annexure-I.(c)  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) are mandated under Section 44 of POCSO Act to monitor the implementation of the POCSO Act. Further Section 43 of the POCSO Act provides that the Central Government and every State Government shall take all measures to give wide publicity to the provisions of the Act. In accordance with this, the Government has taken various steps from time to time to create awareness of the provisions of the POCSO Act through electronic and print media, consultations, workshops and training programmes with stakeholders concerned. In order to generate awareness about the POCSO Act, a short clip (duration 45 secs) on POCSO Act was disseminated in Cinema Halls and Doordarshan across the nation from 02.10.2019 to 08.10.2019. Hon’ble Minister, Women and Child Development (WCD) has written to all the Chief Ministers, Members of Parliament, and Heads of local Bodies/Panchayati Raj Institutions to take note of the POCSO Act as amended, and take all necessary measures for its effective implementation. Secretary, WCD has also written a letter to this effect to all the Secretaries of line Ministries.‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including children, rest primarily with the respective State Governments and UT Administration.*********  ANNEXURE-IStatement Referred To In Part (b) of Reply To Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.4148  For Answer On 13.12.2019 Raised By SHRI CHANDRA SEKHAR BELLANA “Protection Of Children From Sexual Offence” indicating Cases Registered (CR), Cases Chargesheeted (CS), Cases Convicted (CV), Persons Arrested (PAR), Persons Chargesheeted (PCS) and Persons Convicted (PCV) for usage of children for pornographic purpose and storage of pornographic material of children under POCSO ActSL	State/UT	2015	2016	2017		CR	CS	CV	PAR	PCS	PCV	CR	CS	CV	PAR	PCS	PCV	CR	CS	CV	PAR	PCS	PCV1	Andhra Pradesh	11	4	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	02	Arunachal Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	03	Assam	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	2	0	3	2	04	Bihar	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	26	5	0	27	7	05	Chhattisgarh	26	24	0	26	24	0	1	3	0	1	3	0	6	6	3	7	7	36	Goa	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	07	Gujarat	1	2	0	1	2	0	1	1	0	2	2	0	1	1	0	1	1	08	Haryana	3	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	1	0	1	1	09	Himachal Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0	5	5	010	Jammu & Kashmir	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	011	Jharkhand	17	17	17	17	17	17	19	8	0	18	8	0	24	8	2	17	17	212	Karnataka	7	4	0	7	4	0	3	4	0	4	6	0	47	38	3	72	54	413	Kerala	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	1	0	4	1	0	109	76	10	166	72	1014	Madhya Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	8	6	0	11	11	015	Maharashtra	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	9	11	0	14	13	016	Manipur	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	017	Meghalaya	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	018	Mizoram	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	019	Nagaland	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	020	Odisha	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	8	22	3	22	22	321	Punjab	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	32	36	0	32	45	022	Rajasthan	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	2	0	2	2	0	84	64	1	84	84	223	Sikkim	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	024	Tamil Nadu	8	10	0	8	10	0	9	4	0	9	4	0	8	8	1	13	16	125	Telangana	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	5	1	026	Tripura	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	027	Uttar Pradesh	19	19	3	36	32	6	2	2	1	4	4	1	4	1	4	4	4	1128	Uttarakhand	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	029	West Bengal	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	5	0	18	18	0	2	12	0	1	12	0 	TOTAL STATE(S)	94	82	20	102	95	23	47	33	2	65	51	2	374	303	27	485	374	3630	A&N Islands	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	031	Chandigarh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	032	D&N Haveli	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	033	Daman & Diu	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	034	Delhi	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	035	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	036	Puducherry	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0 	TOTAL UT(S)	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	94	82	20	107	95	23	47	33	2	65	51	2	374	303	27	485	374	36 Source: Crime in India
