ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 Yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) have been launched from Kharif 2016 by the Government in the country.  All food and oilseed crops and commercial/horticultural crops can be notified under the PMFBY subject to availability of past yield data based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments   and capacity   of the States to  conduct the requisite number of CCEs for each crop and insurance unit area.   However, for coverage of crops under RWBCIS requisite weather data is the prerequisite.   As per the provisions of the scheme, specific crops and areas under the schemes are notified by the concerned State Government.    State-wise details of crops notified by States during Kharif 2018 and Rabi 2018-19 season are annexed.Actuarial/bidded premium rate is charged by the insurance companies.  But farmers have to pay maximum of 2% of sum insured for Kharif and 1.5% for Rabi food and oilseed crops and 5% for commercial/horticultural crops.  Remaining part of actuarial premium shared equally the Central and State Government.(b):	  During implementation of the scheme, some complaints about non-payment and delayed payment of claims; under payment of claims on account of incorrect/delayed submission of insurance proposals by banks; discrepancy in yield data, unrealistic assessment of crop loss due to large unit area of insurance; delay in providing Government share of funds etc., have been received in the past.   Most of the complaints were suitably addressed by the Insurer and the Ministry.
