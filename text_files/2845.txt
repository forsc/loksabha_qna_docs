                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a): 	No Sir. As per the existing arrangements, procurement is made of the crops for which Minimum Support Price (MSP) is announced through Central and State agencies. In so far as cereals/nutri cereals are concerned, they are procured through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and decentralized procurement system mainly for distribution under the public distribution system (PDS), for welfare schemes and buffer stocking for food security. The objective of foodgrains procurement by Government agencies is to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce and do not have to resort to distress sale.Further, in order to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, the Government has launched a new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA), comprising Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS), and pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS). PSS is implemented for pulses, oilseeds and copra. For oilseeds, states have options to choose either PSS or PDPS in a given procurement season with respect to a particular oilseed crop for the entire state.Contd…2/--2-PSS is implemented at the request of the concerned State Government which agrees to exempt the procured commodities of pulses, oilseeds and copra from levy of mandi tax and assist central nodal agencies, in logistic arrangements, including gunny bags, working capital for state agencies, creation of revolving fund for PSS operations, etc. as required under the scheme guidelines. Procurement of these commodities are undertaken directly from pre-registered farmers within the stipulated period and conforming to the prescribed Fair Average Quality (FAQ) norms by Central Nodal Agencies through the State level agencies at MSP announced by the Government as and when prices fall below MSP. Under PSS, during 2018-19 (as on 24 June 2019), 18.09 lakh tonnes of oilseeds and 19.31 lakh tonnes of pulses have been procured. For Kharif  Marketing Season 2018-19 (as on 19 June 2019), 432.3 lakh tonnes of rice and for Rabi Marketing Season 2019-20 (as on 19 June 2019) 340.6 lakh tonnes of wheat have been procured. (b) & (c):	The National Commission on Farmers (NCF) under the Chairmanship of Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, submitted its final report in 2006. The commission also prepared the ‘Draft National Policy for Farmers’. The government approved the ‘National Policy for Farmers in 2007’ (NPF-2007). The policy aims to improve economic viability of farming and increase net income of farmers. The Policy provisions in NPF-2007 include: (i) asset reforms in respect of land, water, livestock, fisheries and bioresources; (ii) Supply of good quality seeds and disease-free planting material, (iii) Issue of soil health passbooks to the farmers and integrated pest management system; (iv) Region and crop specific implements and machinery; (v) Support services for women; (vi) Timely, adequate and easy reach of institutional credit at reasonable interest rates and farmer-friendly insurance instruments; (vii) Support services and inputs like application of frontier technologies; (viii) Agricultural bio-security system; (ix) Use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and setting up of farm schools to revitalize agricultural extension; (x) Coverage of farmers under a comprehensive national social security scheme; (xi) Effective implementation of Minimum Support Price (MSP) across the country and establishing community food grain banks; (xii) Development of agricultural market infrastructure and terminal markets for agriculture; (xiii) Curriculum reforms in agricultural universities; (xiv) Special categories of farming like organic farming and contract farming; (xv) Rural non-farm employment initiative for farm households; and (xvi) Integrated approach for rural energy, etc.An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), which was constituted for preparation of Plan of Action, identified 201 Action Points from NPF-2007, where necessary action had to be taken. Of the 201 number of action points identified, 200 numbers have already been implemented as of date.********
