RAJDEEP ROY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.11.2019 REGARDING BROAD GAUGE TRACKS IN MIZORAM(a):	Silchar to Sairang Broad Gauge line comprises of 3 projects.  Status of these projects is as under:(i)	Silchar - Katakhal section (19.71 km) is a part of main Gauge Conversion project [Lumding - Badarpur - Katakhal - Silchar (210 km), Badarpur - Kumarghat (118 km), Arunachal - Jiribam (50 km) and Material Modification for Gauge Conversion of Baraigram - Dullabcherra (29.40 km), Karimganj - Maishashan (10 km) and Karimganj byepass line (3.50 km)]. Gauge Conversion of Lumding - Badarpur - Katakhal - Silchar section was commissioned in November, 2015 and the complete project has been commissioned in November, 2017.(ii)	Katakhal - Bhairabi Gauge Conversion project (84 km) was commissioned in May, 2016.(iii)	Bhairabi - Sairang New Line (51.38 km):  Project was sanctioned in 2008-09. Latest anticipated cost of the project is `5021 crores. An expenditure of `2672 crores has been incurred upto March, 2019. An outlay of `750 crores has been provided for 2019-20. Construction work has been taken up throughout the length of the project.(b):	Bhairabi - Sairang New Line project is quite challenging as it passes through hilly area and is a Ghat section involving construction of tunnels and tall bridges (more than 70 meter height).  Also there is scarcity of construction materials (i.e. sand, stone, chips etc.) which is transported from Assam. Further, around 54 Hectare land is yet to be acquired by the Government of Mizoram for construction of terminal station facilities at Sairang Railway Station.  As such, confirmed completion time for project cannot be fixed at this stage.*****
