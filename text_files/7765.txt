ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The Integrated Action Plan (IAP) was implemented in 88 districts w.e.f. Nov. 2010 to equip them with public infrastructure and services such as School Buildings, Anganwadi Centres, Primary health Centers, drinking Water Supply, Village Roads, and furniture in School etc. IAP was discontinued w.e.f from 2015-16. The rational for discontinuation was due to higher devolution of union net tax receipts from 32% to 42% on the basis of acceptance of recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC). However, the IAP was replaced by a special initiative launched in 2017-18 for 3 years with total outlay of Rs. 3000 Cr at the rate of annual outlay of Rs. 1000 Cr under which projects are being funded in LWE affected districts as a special measure to develop these districts. Since inception of the Programme Rs. 1775 Cr has been released to the States till date for 30 most affected districts. Important intervention approved under this programme is placed at Annexure-A. Funds released to different States are placed at Annexure-B.(b)	& (c) The projects under the aforesaid special initiative are regularly reviewed. Firstly, a District Level Committee (DLC), headed by District Magistrate having Superintendent of Police (SP) and Division Forest Officer (DFO) approved the projects. Secondly, at State level the progress is monitored and reviewed by State Level Committee under the Chief Secretary of the State. Thirdly, a Central Level Committee (CLC) at Ministry of Home Affairs releases the funds in 02 installments on the basis of the utilization of the funds released earlier under the programme.  The CLC reviews and monitors the overall progress periodically with the States and districts. d)	The provision of approval of the projects by a Committee of DM, SP and DFO is to ensure that projects are selected on the basis of local requirements. Similarly, this Committee comprising of three key district level officials and the review mechanism mentioned under (b) above is to ensure that the projects are implemented efficiently.  In addition, 35 LWE Districts have also been included in the on-going Aspirational Districts Programme under which special monitoring mechanism has been instituted with respect to important indicators pertaining to sectors viz. health & nutrition, school education, agriculture and water resources, skill development and financial inclusion and basic infrastructure.
