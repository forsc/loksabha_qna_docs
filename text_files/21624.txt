ANSWER




                                                        (a): As per Indian Council of Medical Research’s “National Cancer Registry Programme Report, 2020”, the estimated number of   cervical cancer cases in the country reported   during 2015-2020 state/UT wise is at Annexure.(b) & (c): National Technical Advisory Group on Immunixation (NTAGI) is India’s apex technical advisory body to make recommendations for inclusion of any new vaccine in country’s Universal Immunization Program(UIP).  NTAGI considers key factors like disease epidemiology, clinical characteristics, economic considerations, vaccine and immunization characteristics and other public considerations before making recommendations for any new vaccine introduction.  As of now HPV Vaccine has not been recommended by NTAGI for inclusion in UIP.(d): Public health and hospitals is a state subject, the central Government supplements efforts of State Government through technical and financial supports.  In order to combat the major Non Communicable Disease (NCDs) including cancer, Government of India is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) for interventions upto district level under the National Health Mission(NHM), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment and follow up to non-communicable diseases including cancer. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) including cancer, 638 NCD Clinics at District level and 4464 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS. Treatment for cancer is also available at other health facilities run by the Central and State Governments.With Ayushman Bharat, India has launched health care services in a holistic manner to include preventive and promotive health care. A population level initiative of prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. Oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out, as a part of comprehensive primary health care. Under this initiative, frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), inter alia, are leveraged to carry out screening as well as to generate awareness about the risk factors of NCDs including cancer among the masses. The initiative is under implementation across the country. Screening for common NCDs including cancer is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres.Several awareness initiatives have been undertaken by the Government including observance of National Cancer Awareness Day, organising of screening for major NCDs and major awareness events at occasions such as the India International Trade Fair (IITF), Delhi and use of print, electronic and social media, etc. In addition NPCDCS supports awareness generation activities to be undertaken by the States.
