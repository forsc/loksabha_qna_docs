ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d): 	The primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the State Government. To supplement the efforts of the State, the Government of India extends logistic and financial support to them to assist the rescue and relief efforts in the event of a disaster. Government of India also provides financial assistance to the affected States from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per laid down procedure for “immediate relief” and not for compensation of the loss suffered. With regard to rehabilitation, reconstruction, medium and long term measures, this has to be undertaken by the concerned State Governments from their own resources/ Central Schemes, and based upon their existing policies, since execution of rehabilitation measures on the ground is the responsibility of the concerned State.-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.No.2590 FOR 09.07.2019	In order to give relief to the people affected due to the ‘Cyclone Gaja’ in the State of Tamil Nadu, the Central Government had approved the assistance of Rs.1146.12 crore subject to adjustment of 50% of balances available in the SDRF account as on 1st April, 2018. Accordingly, an amount to the tune of Rs. 900.31 Crore from NDRF has been released to the State. Further, as on 1st April, 2018, Rs.491.62 Crore was also available in their SDRF apart from the amount of Rs. 786 crore allocated for the year 2018-19. Thus, the total amount to the tune of Rs.2177.93 crore was available for the year 2018-19 with the State of Tamil Nadu for providing relief to the people.*****
