ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under PMKVY 2016-20, 1,57,099 candidates have been trained/oriented in State of Gujarat including 6,062 candidates of Rajkot. The district wise details are given at Annexure.(b)	PMKVY 2016-20 has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the States / UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).There is no provision of State/UT-wise allocation of fund under CSCM component while funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States/UTs under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20. Under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, after evaluation of proposal received from Gujarat Skill Development Mission (GSDM), Government of Gujarat, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 77,824 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 119.82 Cr. for FY 2017-20. Out of which, Rs. 35.94 Cr. has been already disbursed to State of Gujarat for the implementation of this component in State of Gujarat covering all districts including Rajkot. However, after rationalisation, the fund allocated for State of Gujarat has been reduced to Rs. 98.85 crore.(c)	Under the Short Term Training component of PMKVY, the placement data is reported within 90 days of certification of trained candidate. As per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), as on 12.06.2019, 50,967 candidates are certified under STT of PMKVY 2016-20 in State of Gujarat. The number of candidates certified under STT of PMKVY in State of Gujarat 90 days prior i.e. upto 12.03.2019 is 43,844. Out of these candidates, as on 12.06.2019, 24,136 candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors.(d)	Ministry has undertaken various measures to encourage greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem to improve employment outcomes. Employer led skill development is also being promoted to further improve placements rates under PMKVY 2016-20.Under PMKVY 2016-20, there are provisions for increasing the placement of the trained candidates. Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. The Scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. Further, the reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate.
