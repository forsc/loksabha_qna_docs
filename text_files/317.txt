ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c): Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act,2009 provides for admission of children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groupsin the neighbourhood private unaided schools in Class I or below to the extent of at least 25percent of the strength of that class.Section 12 (1)(c) of RTE Act 2009 is applicable in 34 States and UTs only. The RTE Act 2009 isnot applicable in the State of Jammu & Kashmir and Section 12 (1) (c) is not applicable in UT ofLakshadweep as it does not have any private unaided school. For implementation of this section,States and UTs are required to notify the disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, notify perchild cost and start admissions in private un-aided schools. Accordingly, 33 States/ UT havenotified disadvantaged groups and weaker sections which are eligible for admission in Privateunaided Schools under Section 12 (1)(c). Telangana is the only State which has not yet notifiedDisadvantaged groups and Weaker Sections.As per Annual Work Plan and Budget of the States and UTs (AWP&B 2019-20), 17 States andUTs are admitting children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker section in privateunaided schools under Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act. Information provided by the States andUTs indicate that there is a consistent increase in the number of children getting admission orcontinuing under this provision. The reimbursement is based on per child cost norms notified bythe State/UT concerned for classes I to VIII. The reimbursement from Central Government toStates and UTs has started from 2014-15 onwards.Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) vide letter no 12-5/2016-EE.11 dated25.05.2016 requested States/UTs to carry out a ground assessment of private unaided schoolsacross the country to ensure compliance with the provisions of Section 12 (1)(c) of RTE Act,2009. Further, MHRD, in various meetings like State Education Secretaries Conference, ProjectApproval Board Meetings, Regional workshops, reviews and emphasizes on the properimplementation of the provisions of the RTE Act.Whenever This Ministry receives complaints about non-compliance of RTE Act, relating toreservation of seats for the Economically Weaker Sections in private schools, such complaintsare forwarded to concerned States and UTs for taking appropriate action as per their existingrules. Education is in the Concurrent List and majority of the schools are under the purview ofthe State Governments and it is primarily for the States to take appropriate action forimplementation of RTE Act.Samagra Shiksha an integrated scheme for School Education has been launched by Government ofIndia from 2018-19, for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class 12 bysubsuming the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA),Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). The schemeprovides for support to the States & UTs for implementation of RTE Act, including reimbursementof expenditure incurred by the States & UTs under Section 12(1)(c) of the Act.****
