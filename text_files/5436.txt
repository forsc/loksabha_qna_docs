                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a)  	Yes, Sir. Aquatic Quarantine Facility is required to maintain a group of aquatic animals in isolation with no direct or indirect contact with other aquatic animals, in order to undergo observation for a specified length of time and, if appropriate, testing and treatment, including proper treatment of effluent waters. The primary purpose of quarantine is to minimize the risk of introducing infectious agents (pathogens) into the national territory of the importing country and their escape and spread to susceptible species. (b) Yes, Sir. The Government of Tripura has informed that they have received a proposal for establishment of Aquatic Animal Health Monitoring Research & Quarantine Station from a private party.  The State Government has requested the Central Governmnet for guidance on the action to be taken by the them. (c) It is informed by the Government of Tripura that they have not yet set any timeline for starting the project as the private firm has still no land in their possession.  (d) The import of fish and fishery products is regulated under provisions of Livestock Importation Act, 1898 as amended from time to time. Presently, live fishes are allowed through designated ports of entry where Animal Quarantine and Certification Services (AQCS) are authorized to inspect and clear the consignment on the basis of a standard sanitary protocol.  *****
