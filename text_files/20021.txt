ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI D V SADANAND GOWDA)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir.  As approved by the Cabinet, Office Memorandum for evaluation of reasonableness of MRP of Phosphatic & Potassic (P&K) fertilizers was issued on 3.5.2013 to all P&K fertilizer companies. Subsequently, Department of Fertilizers initiated evaluation of the reasonableness of MRPs of P&K fertilizers as per the audited cost data submitted by the companies and also issued the detailed guidelines on 15.11.2019. Under the examination of reasonableness, the profit earned above 12% are treated as ‘unreasonable profit’. (c) & (d):  The Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, NBS rates are decided on annual basis and provided as subsidy on P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. P&K fertilizers are under Open General License (OGL) and decontrolled under the NBS Scheme. Therefore, MRP which is fixed by the P&K fertilizer companies as per market dynamics keeping in view the relevant factors like international prices, exchange rate, inventory level and NBS rates etc is monitored through the reasonable exercise by the Government.******
