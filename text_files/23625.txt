                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY ANDCONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4713 BY DR. HEENA GAVIT, DR. SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE, DR. SUJAY RADHAKRISHNA VIKHE PATIL, SHRI DHAIRYASHEEL SAMBHAJIRAO MANE AND SHRI UNMESH BHAIYYASAHEB PATIL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2021 REGARDING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS(a): Railway projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes, augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throw forward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands. As on 01.04.2020, 513 Railway projects (189 New line, 54 Gauge Conversion and 270 Doubling works) of 53,039 km length, costing approx. `7.5 lakh Crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which 10,013 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of  `1.86 lakh crore has been incurred upto March, 2020. The Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise as the Indian Railways’ network spans across various State boundaries. However, 39 projects  (16 New Line, 05 Gauge Conversion and 18 Doubling Projects), covering a length of 6772 km costing `86,696 crore falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra  are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which, 1026 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `17,841 crore has been incurred upto March, 2020.Thorough review of projects has been carried out and with focused approach, projects have been prioritized into 58 Super Critical Projects, 68 Critical Projects, 20 Additional Coal Projects, 41 Additional HDN/HUN   Projects,  43  Essential  Multi  tracking  Projects,  9 National Projects, 55 Essential New line Projects and 30 Gauge conversion projects and all out sincere and focused approach is being adopted by Railway for quick execution so as to get early returns to Railways.  The Completion of Railway project(s) depends on various factors like expeditious land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project(s). Nevertheless, every efforts is being made to execute the project(s) expeditiously.Average annual Budget allocation for infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Maharashtra during 2014-19, has increased to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 310% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14 and budget outlay of `6,572 crore was provided to these projects for financial year 2020-21 which is 461% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. Budget outlay of `7,107 crore has been proposed to these projects for Financial Year 2021-22 which is 507% more than Average Annual outlay of 2009-14.During 2014-19, 596 km length (87 km New Lines, 92 km Gauge Conversion and 417 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra has been commissioned, which is 104% more than the commissioning during 2009-14 (292 km). During 2019-20, 183 km Doubling has been commissioned which is 213% more than average annual commissioning during 2009-14 (58.4 km/year).(b): Yes, Sir. The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) project comprising 2853 route km has witnessed major progress recently and a total of 657 km of sections have been commissioned on Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridor during the year: (i)	Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor: New Baupur New Khurja section (351 km) commissioned on 29.12.2020. (ii)	Western Dedicated Freight Corridor: New-Rewari-New Kishangarh-Madar section (306 km) commissioned on 07.01.2021.The entire project is targeted for completion by June 2022. (c): 184 km route length of Western DFC falls in the state of Maharashtra. (d) & (e): Delay in completion of DFC is, mainly due to following reasons: (i)  Delay in land acquisition and physical possession of land, (ii) replacement of all level crossing (LCs) with Road Over Bridges (ROBs)/Road Under Bridges (RUBs), (iii) resistance by Project Affected People (PAP) in handing over land, (iv) court cases related to land issues, (v) working Capital problem with EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contractors and (vi) effect of COVID-19 on supply chain of material.All efforts are being made to resolve the above issues and expedite the work in consultation with State Governments. Various measures have been undertaken to improve the cash flow of the contractors by implementing the guidance issued by Ministry of Finance. *****
