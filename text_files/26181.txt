ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	&(b) 	Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has commissioned a project for survey of degraded forest area in about 10000 ha  each in 26 States/UTs, using LiDAR technology and preparation of  Detailed Project Reports(DPRs) for Soil Moisture Conservation (SMC) works.10 DPRs pertaining to Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura States have been finalized so far.The DPRs have been prepared using LiDAR technology in which3-D(three dimensional) DEM (Digital Elevation Model), is prepared based on survey of vegetation, streams and water catchments. The DPRs recommend different types of soil and water conservation structures such as Anicut, Gabion, Gully Plug, Mini percolation tank, Percolation Tank, Field bund, Sunken pond, Farm pond, Plantations of trees including fodder plants etc.Appropriate soil and water conservation structures at specific locations help in catching and retention of rain water and prevent stream run off which helps in groundwater recharge and greater surface water availability for wild animals and for regeneration of trees and grasses. It also prevents soil erosion, thus reducing further degradation of the area. The resultant improved regeneration and enhanced fodder availability in forest areas encourages wild animals to remain inside forest and not to enter the adjoining areas in search of food and fodder, thereby reducing human-animal conflict out of such wild animals.(c)All participating States have been advised to implement the DPRs with funds available with them, such as State Plan Funds, State Fund under Compensatory Afforestation Fund, Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) etc.(d)The above project for survey and DPR preparations has been awarded to M/S WAPCOS (a Government of India Undertaking) under Ministry of Jal Shakti. So far,Rs.6.18 crores have been released to the implementing agency for survey and DPR preparation.*****
