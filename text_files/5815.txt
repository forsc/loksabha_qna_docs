Enayam	The Union Cabinet gave in-Principle approval for setting up of the Port at Enayam(Tamilnadu) on 5.7.2016.Thereafter, V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust engaged Consultants   for preparations of Detailed Project Report (DPR). However, DPR could not be completed due to agitation by the local public.2.	Duggirajupatnam	The project development of Port at Duggirajupatnam in Andhra Pradesh is listed in Schedule XIII of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. NITI Aayog has informed that the project will not be viable due to strong competition from nearby ports of Krishnapatnam, Ennoreand Chennai, which are respectively 40, 80 and 80 km away from the proposed Port. It was also noted by NITI Aayog that there will be an adverse impact on nearby ports as these ports are currently operating at 65% capacity only.However, Ministry of Shipping has now constituted an Expert Committee to examine the proposal for Development of a Major Port in Andhra Pradesh and recommend further course of action in the matter.                                                               </pre>                                        ******
