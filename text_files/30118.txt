ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)   To prevent the Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), TRAI has issued Telecom Commercial Communication Customers Preference Regulation-2018 (TCCCPR-2018) on 19.07.2018. As per the provisions of TCCCPR-2018, every Access Provider shall ensure that no commercial communication is made to any recipient except as per the provisions of the Regulations. Telecom subscribers can register their preferences about the type of commercial communications they want to receive with their Telecom Service Provider. The TCCCPR-2018 Regulation has provision to take action against entities who are in violation of these regulations. In case a subscriber receives UCC, then he can make a complaint by sending a SMS or making a voice call at 1909 or through TRAI DnD App/ Telecom Service Provider’s App. The Telecom Service Providers are responsible to take further action on UCC complaints as per the regulations. However, TCCCPR-2018 does not deal with all types of unwanted Calls and messages which might include malicious calls, threatening calls, Financial frauds etc.  (b)	 The mechanism of ‘Do Not Call Register’ was available in the TCCCPR- 2010 under the provision of ‘Customer Preference Registration Facility’ and a similar provision is also there in the latest TCCCPR-2018 issued on 19.07.2018. 	The earlier regulatory framework of TCCCPR-2010, was having various problems related to effectiveness and efficiency of the regulatory framework. In order to address the issues and concerns of TCCCPR-2010, TRAI initiated a consultation process on UCC on 14.09.2017 and subsequently, the revised Regulations i.e. TCCCPR-2018 was issued on 19.07.2018.(c) & (d) 	As on date, there is no proposal to reconsider the existing mechanism for controlling and preventing unwanted calls at present.******
