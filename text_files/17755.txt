ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Odisha, Goa, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar have reported that, no incident of sale of pesticides with banned chemicals and herbicide-tolerant cotton seeds have been reported in their States and UT. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana have reported no incidences of sale of pesticides with banned chemicals; however, some incidences of sale of herbicide-tolerant (HT) cotton seeds have been reported in these States.State Government of Maharashtra has reported that Herbicide Tolerant Cotton Seeds (HTBT) has been seized in various districts of Maharashtra during 2020-21. Total 12148 packets and 1293 Kg. loose seeds worth Rs. 114.69 lakh has been seized in Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Dhule, Beed, Jalna, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Amravati, Nagpur, Wardha, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts and 40 FIRs have been lodged against culprits.         State Government of Gujarat has reported that, total 5 cases of illegal sales of HT Cotton crop were reported during 2019-20 in 4 districts of the State and in all cases, FIRs were registered against accused.Contd….2/-- 2 - Government of Telangana has reported that during 2019 and 2020, no samples drawn from dealer premises have been found positive. However, the spurious cotton seeds sourced from other areas which make entry into the State particularly in boarder districts i.e. Adilabad, Mancherial & Asifabad are being checked effectively and the Police Department is arresting the offenders who are in the chain of such spurious seeds circulation. IPC sections are being applied in such cases.As there are no incidences of sale of pesticides with banned chemicals, the question of its impact on crops and health of the farmers does not arise. However, as far as the HT cotton seeds are concerned, they are not approved for use in the country.In addition to the punitive actions mentioned above, the State Governments have alerted the quality control inspectors and district authorities to be vigilant to the illegal sale of HT cotton seeds duly taking samples in all cases of suspicion and taking consequential action in cases of mischief. Time and again farmers are being educated extensively not to use HT Cotton seeds by the concerned State Governments. In addition, to check the sale of HT cotton seeds, an Inter-Ministerial Field Inspection and Scientific Evaluation Committee (FISEC) had been constituted for on-the-spot inspection of the cotton fields to assess the veracity of spread of unapproved HT cotton in the country, to confirm the presence of gene(s), strategies and measures to contain it. The FISEC has suggested strategies for immediate action, short term action and medium term action to control and curb the spread of HT cotton. As a follow up step, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare has issued advisory to all cotton growing states urging them to take all the necessary steps to check the sale and cultivation of unapproved HT cotton.*****
