Under the above schemes, the targeted beneficiaries are provided with monthly assistance ranging between Rs.200-500 depending on age of the beneficiary and category of the pension. Further, States/Union Territories (UTs) have been requested to contribute at least an equal amount under these schemes of NSAP.
