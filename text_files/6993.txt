                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Utkela airport in Odisha figures in the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) document. In first round of bidding under RCS - UDAN, RCS routes connecting Utkela with Bhubaneshwar & Raipur were awarded to Selected Airline Operator (SAO). However, due to non-compliance of SAO agreement by SAO, network was cancelled by the Implementing Agency. No airline submitted proposal to operate RCS flight from Utkela in subsequent rounds of bidding under the scheme. In case, any proposal to operate RCS flight from Utkela is received in future rounds, same may be considered as per provisions of the RCS document. SAO is entitled for Viability Gap Funding upon commencement of RCS - UDAN operations.
