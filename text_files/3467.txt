ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at Annexure-I.Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project.(b)  An enabling allocation of Rs.100 lakhs for inter-linking of Rivers (ILR) programme has been made in the budget of each of the last three years. As the ILR projects are not at implementation stage, hence, no expenditure has been incurred on implementation of the ILR projects so far.(c) to (e)	NWDA has received 47 intra-state link projects from 9 States viz., Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Bihar. NWDA completed the Pre-Feasibility Reports (PFRs) of 37 intra-state link projects so far. The present status of the link projects is furnished in Annexure-II. Based on the request of States, DPRs of Kosi-Mechi link, Burhi Gandak-Noon-Baya-Ganga link of Bihar, Wainganga-Nalganga link of Maharashtra and Ponnaiyar-Palar link of Tamil Nadu have also been completed.*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †3047 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
