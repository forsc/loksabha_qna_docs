                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH  PATEL) (a) & (b) Since August 2019, Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) for making provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household, including those in all the districts which inter alia include Bokaro, Giridih, Dhanbad and Ramgarh districts of Jharkhand, by 2024. The estimated outlay of the mission is Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore, out of which Central share is Rs. 2.08 lakh Crore.District wise fund allocations is not made and maintained by this department. However, details of Central fund allocated, fund drawn and fund utilization reported by the State of Jharkhand under Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (as on 27.03.2022) is as under:(Amount in Rs. Crore)YearCentral share	Expenditure under State share	Opening Balance	 Allocation	Fund drawn by the State	Total fund available	Reported utilization	2019-20	75.79	267.69	291.19	366.98	114.58	119.712020-21	268.39	572.24	143.06	411.45	286.62	177.732021-22	137.93	2,479.88	512.22	650.15	279.83	343.71Source: JJM, IMIS(c) At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission, out of 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore (17%) households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, more than 6.07 Crore (31.42%) rural households have been provided with tap water connections in last two and half years. Thus, as of date, out of 19.32 Crore rural households in the country, 9.31 Crore (48.13%) households are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. As on date, out of 59.23 lakh rural households in the State of Jharkhand, 11.54 lakh (19.47%) households are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. The State/ UT-wise details are annexed. Further, the State/ UT, district & village-wise status of tap water connection in rural households, schools and anganwadi centres etc. as reported by States/ UTs are also in public domain and available on JJM dashboard at: https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx(d) to (g) States plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes as Drinking Water is a State subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual projects/ schemes for rural water supply projects are not maintained at the Government of India level. For ensuring tap water supply in drought-prone & water-scarce areas/ areas with inadequate rainfall or dependable ground water sources, including those in the State of Jharkhand, provisions have been made under JJM for planning and implementation of bulk water transfer from long distances and regional water supply schemes. In addition, provisions have been made for source recharging, viz. dedicated bore well recharge structures, rain water recharge, rejuvenation of existing water bodies, etc., in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, Integrated Watershed Management  Programme (IWMP),15th Finance Commission tied grants to RLBs/ PRIs, State schemes, CSR funds, etc. In order to enhance recharge of aquifers, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, State Governments have been urged to strengthen/ extend existing canal networks and/ or build canals so as to transfer surplus flood waters from dams/ reservoirs to ponds/ lakes and other water bodies and also recharge groundwater during monsoon season. Further, for villages in water-scarce areas, in order to save the precious fresh water, States are also being encouraged to plan new water supply scheme with dual piped water supply system, i.e. supply of fresh water in one and treated grey/ waste water in another pipe for non-potable/ gardening/ toilet flushing use. Moreover, the households in these areas are to be encouraged to use the faucet aerators that save a significant amount of water, in multiple taps they may be using inside their house.Further, water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. For supplementing the efforts of the States, the Central Government has taken various steps for sustainable ground water management in the country.
