ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): To substantially reduce the risk of accidents at unmanned level crossings, all such   unmanned level crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) route have been eliminated before January 2019.    As the level crossings (LCs) are potential safety hazard for both rail and road users,  Railways have decided that no new LC will be provided on existing railway lines.  As per guidelines of railways, Rail Over Bridges (ROBs) in lieu of LCs are provided on cost sharing basis where train vehicles units (TVU) is more than 1 lakh and consent for cost sharing and closure of LC is given by State Govt.   The works are regularly being sanctioned and executed at such level crossing gates in close coordination with State Govt.  Railways have already sanctioned 1509 ROBs.  Construction of ROBs involves sanction of work by State Government, fixing of alignment, shifting of utilities,  acquisition  of land etc. jointly by State Govt. and Railways.   Hence time line for completion of each of the ROBs is decided individually based on above considerations.*****
