ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b): Government has not conducted any such study. From time to time, research organizations, international organizations and agencies of other governments do bring out certain analysis which Government of India takes note of and useful recommendations, if any, are taken as inputs for policy-making. World Bank had released a report on “High and Dry: Climate Change, Water, and the Economy” in 2016 assessing the impact of water scarcity on any economy. (c): The National Institute for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog has developed a Composite Water Management Index to enable effective water management in India. However, the report has not specifically identified the business sectors most sensitive to water shortage.  (d): Water use efficiency and water management are immediate concerns that that need to be addressed to ensure minimal impact on the economy.*****
