                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) : Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. State Government of Gujarat has informed that due to continuous flooding of rivers mainly Bhadar, Ozat. Minsar, Venu in rainy season, the Gher region of Porbandar faces problems of flood inundation which further gets compounded during high tide level of the sea as flood discharge in river cannot be passed to sea during high tide. In order to mitigate the effects of floods, State Government is taking necessary steps like desilting of existing canals, widening and re-grading of river, construction of flood protection walls along farm banks etc. as per requirement. ******
