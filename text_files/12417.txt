ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)  The 14th Finance Commission (FFC) had recommended aggregate corpus of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for all States for the award period 2015-20 and that States contribute 10% to SDRF during the award period with the remaining 90% coming from the Union Government. Government accepted the above recommendation with the modification that the percentage share of the States will continue to be as before; and that, once GST is in place, the recommendation of FFC on disaster relief would be fully implemented. Accordingly, central share of SDRF is being released to States on 75:25 sharing basis between Centre and States in case of general category States and 90:10 in case of special category States.            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been introduced from 01.07.2017. Since GST has not stabilized, the Government has decided that during 14th Finance Commission (14th FC) award period, Centre’s share in SDRF shall remain in the same ratio as it was in 13th FC award period.(b) & (c)	  For the State of Odisha, 14th FC has recommended total allocation of Rs. 865 crore for 2018-19 and Rs. 909 crore for 2019-20. Central share @ 75% works out to Rs. 648.75 crore for 2018-19 and Rs.681.75 crore for 2019-20. Full amount of Central Share of SDRF for 2018-19 and 2019-20 has been released to Govt. of Odisha. (d)      There is no balance pending for release.
