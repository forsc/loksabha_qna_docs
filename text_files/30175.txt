ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) and (b) Kannur International Airport was commissioned in December 2018. Within a period of one year, by Winter 2019 schedule, Indian carriers were operating 65 international services per week from Kannur.;Currently, due to significant imbalance in the number of points of call in favour of foreign carriers, the Government of India is not granting any non-metro airport as a new point of call to any foreign carrier for the purpose of operating passenger services. However, Indian designated carriers are free to mount scheduled operations to/from any international airport including Kannur International Airport to foreign destinations under the ambit of bilateral air service agreements concluded by India with foreign countries.
