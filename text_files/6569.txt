                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for coverage of 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population, i.e. about two-thirds of the total population of the country, for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains. A statement indicating the State-wise percentage coverage under NFSA including Rajasthan and Jharkhand is at Annexure...........2/--2-(b):	The exercise of State-wise coverage within the overall national coverage under NFSA was done by the erstwhile Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) using the 68th round of NSSO Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2011-12). A State-wise cut off level of monthly expenditure was arrived at separately for rural and urban areas and population below this cut off monthly expenditure was eligible for coverage under the Act. The methodology of Planning Commission was such that the percentage coverage under NFSA was not uniform across all States/UTs. Coverage was higher for those States/UTs, where the size of the population below the cut off level of expenditure was relatively large in proportion to their total population vis-à-vis those states where the proportion was smaller. Therefore, the coverage of Rajasthan and Jharkhand was lower vis-à-vis those States that had a higher poverty ratio as compared to these two States.(c): 	No proposal to review the percentage beneficiaries coverage of Rajasthan under NFSA is presently under consideration of Government.***ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.249 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 19.11.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.
