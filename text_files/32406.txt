                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION & BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b):  With a view to promote ease of doing business in the film sector and promote India as a filming destination for attracting investment from foreign film makers, Film Facilitation Office (FFO) was set up by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting in 2015. The web portal www.ffo.gov.in provides a single window facilitation and clearance mechanism to both international and domestic film makers. 123 international projects of feature films, television series and web shows from across 27 countries have been accorded permissions to film in India under this mechanism.(c) and (d): Media & Entertainment sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country. For attracting foreign investment in the film Industry, National Film Development Corporation, under the aegis of Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, organises Film Bazaar at the International Film Festival of India held at Goa, India every year. It is the largest South Asian Film Market and attracts investors from around the world by encouraging creative and financial collaboration between the South Asian and International film communities. Local IP creation and outsourcing work for Western studios are key drivers of growth in the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics sector. In order to support skilled manpower in the animation and VFX sector, Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute, Kolkata and Film and Television Institute of India, Pune run courses on Animation and VFX. The Ministry has also decided to set up a National Centre of Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics for creating a world class talent pool in India to cater to the Indian as well as global industry.
