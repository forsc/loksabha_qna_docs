                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c): Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) was launched with effect from 1st October, 2020 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivize  employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during Covid-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. The salient features of the scheme are summarized  below:•	An employee drawing monthly wage of less than Rs. 15000/- who was not working in any establishment registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) before 1st October, 2020 is eligible for the benefit. The employees who lost their job during Covid-19 pandemic and did not join in any EPF covered establishment upto 30.09.2020 are also eligible for the benefit.•	Government of India is crediting for a period of two years, both the employee’ share (12% of wages) and employer’s share (12% of wages) of contribution payable or only the employee’s share, depending on employment strength of the EPFO registered establishments. •	The scheme has commenced from 1st October 2020 and shall remain open for registration of eligible employers and new employees upto 31st March, 2022. Government is paying the subsidy for two years from the date of registration.There is no specific State-wise target or allocation of funds under the scheme. All eligible establishments are encouraged to take benefits under this scheme. As on 20.11.2021, benefit of Rs. 404.42 crore has been provided to 6.45 lakh beneficiaries through 17,368 establishments in the State of Maharashtra.Mass awareness has been created through large-scale publicity through seminars and workshops with both the employers & employers’ associations and employees and union representatives. Moreover, EPFO is also promoting the scheme through social media platforms. Further, to increase the coverage, the registration of beneficiaries which was initially only upto 30.06.2021 has been extended till 31.03.2022.*****
