The Cabinet in its meeting held on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for BSNL and MTNL which inter-alia, includes in-principle approval for merger of BSNL and MTNL.The merger will benefit BSNL/MTNL through pan-India footprint, synergy in operations, reduction of fixed costs and overheads, sharing of technical infrastructure and enhanced Enterprise Business etc.  This will resultantly help BSNL/MTNL to provide better quality services to their customers on a pan-India basis.Further, the Cabinet approval also includes administrative allotment of spectrum to BSNL and MTNL for providing 4G services.  BSNL is currently providing 4G services on a limited basis in certain areas using its existing spectrum.  With roll out of 4G services on a pan-India basis, BSNL/MTNL will be able to provide high speed mobile internet services in a data-centric market which will further improve the customer experience.Additionally, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of telecom service providers including BSNL and MTNL against the benchmark for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters through quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs).  For the services currently provided by BSNL/MTNL, both are meeting all he benchmarks for all the parameters in their Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) except for the parameter for call drops in West Bengal service area by BSNL.  As regards 5G services by BSNL/MTNL, the standards for IMT 2020 (International Mobile Telecommunications 2020), also known as 5G technologies in industry, are being finalised.  The cabinet has also approved that allotment of spectrum for 5G services will also be made to BSNL and MTNL on the same principle followed for allotment of spectrum for 4G services.************
