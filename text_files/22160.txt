ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a) to (c) Yes sir, migratory birds could be one of the potential sources for introduction of Avian Influenza virus into the country. As per World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of Avian Influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal has taken up a project on “Surveillance of avian influenza in wild/ migratory birds”. As for the number of migratory birds visiting various states of the country annually, the Department does not maintain any such data.(d)      Eastern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ERDDL), Kolkata is involved in testingAvian Influenza for the States/UTs of West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, Sikkim and Andaman & Nicobar. However, as an OIE recognized reference laboratory, ICAR-NIHSAD, Bhopal provides confirmatory diagnostic services on Avian Influenza to all the States and UTs.(e)	 There are 5 (five) Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratories (RDDLs) located region-wise at Bengaluru (Southern), Pune (Western), Jalandhar (Northern), Kolkata (Eastern) and Guwahati (North-Eastern) and one Central Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (CDDL) located at ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareilly involved in testing for Avian Influenza. However, ICAR-NIHSAD, Bhopal is the National Reference Laboratory for confirmation of Avian Influenza. As per information,ICAR-NIHSAD and the other laboratories provide results for the emergency samples received from all states in almost 12-48 hours depending on the time of receipt of the eligible samples there. _________________________
