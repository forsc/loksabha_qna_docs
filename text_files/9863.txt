ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Council of the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education andResearch (NITSER) in its meeting held on 1st October, 2015 decided to give complete feewaiver to students taking admissions in National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and IndianInstitute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, whose family income is lessthan `1.00 lakh per annum and 2/3rd of the tuition fee waiver for students with family incomeless than `5.00 lakh per annum in addition to complete tuition fee exemptions granted to SC /ST / PH students. This resulted in decrease in internal revenue generation of NITs and IIEST.In light of the exemptions in tuition fees structures for protecting interests of the socially andeconomically backward students approved by the Council and in addition very few students intop 2000 JEE ranks taking admission in NITs, the Standing Committee of the Council on 23rdNovember, 2016 recommended scrapping of Merit Scholarship Scheme.*-*-*-*
