ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	 	Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995 is a ‘Defined Contribution-Defined Benefit’ Social Security Scheme. As per the provisions of this Scheme, the pensioners are given pension from the pooled account in which 8.33 per cent of the employee’s pay (statutory limit is Rs.15000/- per month) is contributed by the Employer and 1.16 per cent of the employee’s pay (upto Rs.15000/-) is contributed by the Central Government. Amount of member’s pension is determined on the basis of period of service and the salary on which contribution has been made by a member in the pension fund. The formula for calculating member pension under EPS, 95 is as follows:Contd..2/- ::  2  ::Pensionable Service X Pensionable Salary70(b) & (c):	 The Government has, for the first time, started providing a minimum pension of Rs. 1000 per month to the pensioners under EPS, 1995 from 01.09.2014 by providing additional budgetary support keeping the widespread demands although there is no provision in the Scheme for budgetary support. It is not possible to increase minimum monthly pension amount without compromising the financial viability of the Scheme and/or additional budgetary support. The Government constituted a High Empowered Monitoring Committee for complete evaluation and review of the EPS, 1995. The Committee has recommended, inter-alia, enhancement of monthly pension with fulfilling of certain conditions.*******
