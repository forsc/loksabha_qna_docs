                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a) to (c): Yes Sir. The Supreme Court in its judgment in Civil Appeal No.3123/2020 dated 5th May 2021, not only struck down the reservation given to the Maratha Community by the State Government of Maharashtra but also interpreted the Constitution (one hundred and two) Amendment Act 2018 to state that there should be only one Central List of SEBCs and States are not empowered to maintain a separate State List of SEBCs. Since this not only goes against the legislative intent but would also adversely affect the reservations currently provided to such SEBCs who are only in the State List, Government has decided to bring The Constitution (one hundred and twenty seven) Amendment Bill 2021 before the Parliament to amend the Articles 342A, 338B and 336(26C) of the Constitution to restore the power of the States to maintain their State List of SEBCs.*****
