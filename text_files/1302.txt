In order to ensure better productivity and production and to protect the interest of farmers, Government of India has increased the MSP for 2018-19 by 28% and 26% for Medium Staple Cotton and Long Staple Cotton respectively.  ii)	Nominated the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) as nodal agency to undertake MSP operation in all cotton growing States, in the event when prices of seed cotton (kapas) touches the MSP level, to purchase entire quantity of kapas (FAQ grade) offered by the cotton farmers in various APMC market yards at MSP rates. iii)	Around 350 procurement centres have been opened in all the cotton growing States.
