ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	The One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan is already enabled in 34 States/UTs covering about 75 Crore beneficiaries, that is, 94.3% National Food Security Act (NFSA) population in the country to have an option to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in these States/UTs by using their same/existing ration cards, along with biometric authentication on an electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device. Further, regular follow ups have been done with the 2 remaining States of Assam and Chhattisgarh to enable the same at the earliest, depending upon their technical readiness to implement the mechanism of ration card portability for the benefit of their beneficiaries, particularly migrant NFSA beneficiaries. (c): 		As per the information available from States/UTs, about 37 Lakh MT and 47 Lakh MT of regular NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) foodgrains have been distributed to the beneficiaries (mostly migrant NFSA beneficiaries) through inter-State and intra-State portability transactions under the ONORC plan, during the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 so far respectively. Additionally, about 2.74 LMT foodgrains were also distributed for the period of May and June 2020 to the migrants/stranded migrant persons in the country under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS). ****
