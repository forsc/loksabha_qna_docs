                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):   As per the Sample Registration System (SRS) Bulletins issued in May, 2020, 2019 and September 2017 by the office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India, the infant mortality rate (IMA) has decreased to 32 infant deaths per thousand live births in the year 2018, from 33 in the year 2017 and 34 in the year 2016. Similarly, as per SRS, child mortality rate or under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) for the country has also shown a decline of 1 point over 2018 (36 in 2018 against 37 in 2017) to 2 point over 2016 (37 in 2017 against 39 in 2016). Further, as per the Special Bulletin on Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) 2016-18 issued by the office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India, the MMR  has declined to 113 in 2016-18 from 122 in 2015-17 and 130 in 2014-2016. (c)       There is no credible data to suggest that child marriage is the major reason for IMR & MMR.  There may be various factors that affect motherhood like health, nutrition, lack of medical facilities etc. that may be contributing to the issues of IMR and MMR.(d) to (e):  The Government has enacted the ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006’. The Government also undertakes awareness drives, media campaigns and outreach programmes and issues advisories to the States/ UTs from time to time to highlight evil effects of this practice. Further, the Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the schemes of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)’ in which creation of awareness amongst women on matters pertaining to gender equality and discouraging of child marriage is an important focus area. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also undertakes awareness programmes and consultations with stakeholders from time to time in this regard. *****
