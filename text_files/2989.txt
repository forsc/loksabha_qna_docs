                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b): Sanctions of Railway projects depend on many factors including its financial viability, cost sharing by stake holders, last mile connectivity, operational requirement, socio-economic grounds etc. Projects are taken forward after survey only after due consideration.Total 154 Railway projects have been included in Budget during last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 subject to requisite approvals.  Details of funds spent on each project, allotment of funds and expenditure are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance(Budget) >2019-20_List_of_Works.(c): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affects the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time, without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various level (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) & regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
