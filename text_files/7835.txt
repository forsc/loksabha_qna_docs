ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)     Ministry of Coal releases fund to coal companies under the scheme "Conservation and Safety and Infrastructure Development in Coal Mines" as payment against collection of cess (excise duty) on coal and coke for conservation and development related work including infrastructure development. This cess, a specific purpose levy under the Coal Mines (Conservation and Development) Act, 1975, has now been subsumed under Goods and Services Tax. Releases under the scheme are classified as “subsidies” in the budget of the Ministry for technical reasons.   Fund release to coal industry under the central sector scheme of  "Conservation and Safety and Infrastructure Development in Coal Mines" was Rs. 182.40 Crore in FY 2018-19 in comparison to Rs. 499.50 Crore in FY 2017-18. Further, there is a budget provision of 135 Crore in FY 2019-20 under this scheme.  (b):       Not applicable in view of point (a). ***
