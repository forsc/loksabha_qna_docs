ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	India’s engagement with China is multifaceted. During the visits of President of the People’s Republic of China Mr. Xi Jinping to India in September 2014, the two sides forged a Closer Developmental Partnership, which was further consolidated during the visits of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to China in May 2015. There have been two informal Summits between Prime Minister and the Chinese President Xi Jinping, first in Wuhan (27-28 April 2018) and the second in Chennai (11-12 October 2019). The two countries share the view that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between them will be a positive factor for stability amidst current global uncertainties. To this end the two countries have agreed to significantly enhance efforts to build on the convergences through the established mechanisms in order to create the broadest possible platform for the future relationship. At the same time, the two countries have agreed to handle differences through peaceful discussion within the context of the overall relationship, bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations.  The Government has also taken note of the statements made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The Government has a consistent position that Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India. Government has indicated that it expects other countries to not comment on the internal affairs of India. ***
