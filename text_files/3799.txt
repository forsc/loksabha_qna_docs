The Integrated Scheme for School Education envisages the‘school’ as a continuum from Pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to SeniorSecondary levels. Under Samagra Shiksha, an amount of Rs. 17793.55 lakh has beenapproved for pre-school education.The scheme supports the efforts of State/UT Governments in providing Pre-schooleducation in schools. At pre-school level, support for co-location of Anganwadis in PrimarySchools, curriculum development in convergence with Ministry of Women and ChildDevelopment and training of pre-school teachers and Anganwadi workers is provided.
