ANSWER




                                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	& (b): Land and Colonization are State subjects. Schemes related to slums are implemented by States/UTs. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is supplementing the efforts of States/UTs by providing central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/beneficiaries including slum dwellers. The “In-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR)” component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers across thecountry. So far, a total of 6.34 lakh houses for slums dwellers have been grounded, of which 4.55 lakh houses have been completed with basic facilities under the scheme. The data related to number of slums demolished or evicted is not maintained centrally by the Ministry.                                     *****
