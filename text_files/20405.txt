ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) During the last three years, Government of India has accorded ''In-principle'' approval for development of new Greenfield airports at Hirasar (Rajkot) in Gujarat, Hollongi (Itanagar) in Arunachal Pradesh and Jewar (Noida) in Uttar Pradesh.;(b)  During the last three years, proposals have been received  from State Governments for ''site clearance'' for New Greenfield Airports namely, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, Kota in Rajasthan, Pantnagar in Uttarakhand, Kottayam  and Kasargod in Kerala.(c) A Greenfield airport policy is in place which prescribes procedure and conditions for development of a new Greenfield airport in the country. As per  policy, if any developer including the State Govt. desires to develop an airport, they are required to identify a suitable site and get the Pre-feasibility Study conducted for construction of airport and submit a proposal to the Central Government for ''Site-Clearance'' and ''In-Principle'' approval.;(d) to (f) The responsibility of implementation of airport project including funding of the project rests with the concerned airport developer and the respective State Government (in case the State Govt. is project proponent). Out of the three airports approved during the last three years, Airports Authority of India has undertaken development of Hollongi and Hirasar airports at original project costs of Rs. 646 Cr. and Rs.1405 Cr. respectively from its own resources with probable date of completion (PDC) for both the projects in December, 2022. Jewar airport is a project of State Government of Uttar Pradesh with original project cost Rs. 8638 Crore in Phase-I with PDC in 2023-24. However, timeline for completion of the airport projects depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatory clearances, financial closure, etc.
