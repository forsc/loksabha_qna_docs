PRITAM GOPINATHRAO MUNDE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019 REGARDING PASSENGER TRAINS(a)  	No specific passenger trains have been identified to be run by private players, so far. However, with a view to providing world class services to travelling passengers, Indian Railways are examining various options, including private participation in the operation of passenger carrying trains. (b) & (c) Yes, Sir. A report submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2018, highlighted the challenges presented by large scale privatization to protection of human rights. However, there is no proposal to privatize Indian Railways. (d)  & (e) Projects for providing first mile and last mile connectivity to Ports/Mines/Industrial Clusters from existing Indian Railways network have been taken up on participative policy of Public Private Partnership (PPP), wherein strategic partners including Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), State Governments and Private Industries have come forth and invested in Joint Venture Special Purpose Vehicle (SPVs).*****
