                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) and (b): The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has reported  that captive breeding of Grey Mullet (Madaval) through hormone manipulation is a significant achievement by the  Central Institute of Brackish Water Aquaculture due to its commercial value for coastal aquaculture. Grey mullet is highly demanding brackish water fish for farming in coastal region. Traditionally the fish farmers have been using seeds from the wild for their culture and the Broodstock development, captive breeding and larval rearing through hormone manipulation has now opened the avenues for expansion of grey mullet culture in coastal areas of the country.  (c) to (e): The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing a flagship scheme namely “Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) - to bring about Blue Revolution through sustainable and responsible development of fisheries sector in India” comprising centrally sponsored and central sector component with highest ever investment of Rs.20050 crore in fisheries sector in all the States/Union Territories (UTs) for a period of 5 years with effect from the financial year 2020-21. The PMMSY inter-alia aims to increase inland and coastal fish production with export promotion of the country. The Fisheries Research Institutes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) are undertaking research for the development of monoculture, polyculture and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in the country.*****
