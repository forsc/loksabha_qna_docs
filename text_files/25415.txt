                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) :  The World Consumer Rights Day is celebrated every year on 15th March. This year’s World Consumer Rights Day theme was “Tackle Plastic Pollution”. Department of Consumer Affairs celebrated World Rights Consumer Day virtually in association with Centre for Consumer Studies, Indian Institute of Public Administration by organising an online Webniar on the theme “Tackling Plastic Pollution”. The objective of the celebration was to generate awareness and engage consumers to adopt and promote more sustainable consumption practices and create awareness in tackling global plastic pollution crisis. Apart from events organised by Department, some industries bodies, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), National Law Universities also organised online events to celebrate World Consumer Rights Day.  (e) to (g) : Under the provisions of existing Consumer Protection Act, 2019, a three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism, called Consumer Commission, has been established at the District, State and National levels to provide simple, inexpensive and speedy redressal to consumer disputes. In addition to legislative measures, Department of Consumer Affairs runs a National Consumer Helpline along with Zonal Consumer Helplines in regional languages to deal with consumer grievances. To further strengthen the consumer protection and rights, an executive agency called the Central Consumer Protection Authority has been established as per the provisions of CP Act, 2019 to regulate matters relating to violation of rights of consumers, unfair trade practices and false or misleading advertisements which are prejudicial to the interests of public and consumers and to promote, protect and enforce the rights of consumers as a class. In addition, provisions have been made in the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 for mediation as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism, product liability, making of rules by the Central Government to regulate unfair trade practices in e-commerce and direct selling, penalty for adulteration of products and manufacture/sale of spurious goods. The department also runs a countrywide multimedia “Consumer Awareness” campaign titled ‘Jago Grahak Jago” on various issues related to consumer rights and responsibilities across diverse subjects. As per the information received from National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, details of functional Consumer Commissions at States and District level is given at Annexure.  As per the information available on CONFONET portal, during the last three years, 3,20,754 cases have been disposed by all Consumer Commissions across the Country.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (e) TO (g) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1213 FOR 27.07.2021 REGARDING CONSUMER RIGHTS DAY.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- STATE-WISE DETAILS OF OPERATIONAL CONSUMER COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
