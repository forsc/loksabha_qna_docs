                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 794 BY  SHRI N.K. PREMACHANDRAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 26.06.2019  REGARDING  SECOND ENTRANCE AT KOLLAM RAILWAY STATION(a): 	As far as New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects in the country are concerned, 189 New Line, 55 Gauge Conversion and 247 Doubling projects are in various stages of planning/approval/execution in the country. Out of the total length of 48860.64 Kms. of these projects, 9113.32 Kms. have been commissioned. Latest anticipated cost of these 491 projects is ` 6,47,602.93 crores and expenditure of  ` 1,43,150.07 crores has been done on these projects upto March, 2019. Budget Outlay of `  30,198 crores has been made for these projects during 2019-20.Indian Railways have taken various initiatives to increase pace of execution of New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects. This includes-i.	Railway has recently issued policy guidelines for land acquisition.  Under this policy, Railway has decided to take up the execution only after complete land acquisition.  However, General Managers of Zonal Railways have been empowered to invite tenders if they have written assurance of the State Government for the land acquisition. They have also been given powers to review the projects where land acquisition has been delayed.ii.	Institutional financing by tying up loan with M/s Life Insurance Corporation of India Limited for ` 1.5 lakh crores for assured funding of viable projects has increased Railway’s capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.iii.	Regular follow up with State Government for land acquisition. All Chief Secretaries of the concerned State Governments have been advised the details of land acquisition, Funds deposited etc. and have been requested to expedite the land acquisition.(b):	Till 2013-14, due to overall limited availability of funds, most of the projects were not progressing satisfactorily.  Since 2014-15, based on physical progress of projects, last mile connectivity projects and projects for decongesting the existing routes have been given sufficient funds. For this purpose, funds for capacity enhancement projects have been arranged through institutional financing by arranging loan with M/s Life Insurance Corporation of India Limited for ` 1.5 lakh crores for assured funding of viable projects.  Thus, there is no constraint of Funds for Execution of Doubling/3rd & 4th Line projects. However, execution/completion of projects depends on a number of factors such as statutory clearances, acquisition of land, shifting of various utility services etc. Therefore, it is not feasible to give fixed time lines for completion of the projects.(c) and (d): It is proposed to complete the pending works related to 2nd Entry at Kollam. In this regard, Second Entry work at Kollam consists of development of parking area, Booking office, Foot Over Bridge connecting 2nd Entry to Platform No.1 & 2, Lift at Platform No.1&2 and Escalators at Platform No.1&2.The major works of developing Parking area and Booking Office on 2nd Entry along with allied works have since been commissioned and opened to public in March, 2019. The works of construction of Foot Over Bridge from second entry to Platform No. 2 has been completed and commissioned. The construction of Foot Over Bridge between Platform No. 2 to Platform   No. 1 is under progress and has been planned for completion during 2019-20.As the Foot Over Bridge work is currently under progress, Escalator and Lift Work can be taken up after completion of Foot Over Bridge work.Electrification of second entry booking office and LED station name board work have been completed.*****
