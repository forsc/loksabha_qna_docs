ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The number of farmers registered by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh so far under the Scheme, district-wise, the number of farmers who have been released the benefit and the number of farmers yet to be released the benefit are given in the Annexure.(c):	The implementation mechanism of the scheme has been devised in such a way as to avoid any inclusion-exclusion errors.  The database of beneficiary farmers is prepared by the State / UT Governments, which is checked and validated for various parameters of the scheme, like adherence to exclusion factors, Aadhaar numbers, mobile numbers, bank account numbers, category of acceptable bank accounts like Saving Account, Jan Dhan Accout, etc., by effectively utilizing modern Information Technology tools with combined synergies of various agencies like the National Informatics Centre (NIC), the Public Finance Management System (PFMS), the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), etc. Unvalidated data is reverted back to the State/UT Governments for re-verification and re-submission, if required. Only after the multi-level verification and validation of the data by various concerned agencies, including the banks, the amount is transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. However, the entire procedure has been continuously reviewed and fine-tuned with the requirements of the scheme so as to achieve the ultimate goal of expeditious transfer of the financial benefit to the genuine beneficiaries.Contd…2/--2-(d):	Panchayti Raj Institutions have been envisaged to be involved at various stages of implementation of the Scheme particularly in the identification of beneficiaries, extension & awareness creation amongst farmers, obtaining feed-back of the farmers etc. Clause 10.5 of the Operational Guidelines of the Scheme also provides that the beneficiaries’ lists would be displayed at Panchayats to ensure greater transparency and information. Accordingly, instructions have been issued to all State/UT Governments to display the names of beneficiaries in Panchayats.(e):	Dr. C. Rangarajan Committee had been constituted to review the methodology for measurement of poverty in the country.  The PM-Kisan Scheme, which is an income support scheme exclusively for landholding farmers subject to exclusion criteria, has no linkages with the report of that Committee.(f):	The  PM-Kisan Scheme has been launched recently i.e. February. 2019 and hence no study has been conducted.
