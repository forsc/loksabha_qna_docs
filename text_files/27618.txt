ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed that Mr. John Paice, a PhDstudent at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy & Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India,jointly with University of Southampton, UK created the movie in 2019 which was widelycovered by the media in India and all over the world. The movie can be found athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V-sjuOzVVA(c): The UGC has further informed that many aspects of black hole research are carried out atIUCAA by faculty, students and other researchers. This includes theoretical studies of theformation and growth of black holes, of both the stellar mass and supermassive varieties, andtheir effect on Space and Time and the nature of gravitational waves and the implications ofthe General theory of relativity.For the last six years, IUCAA scientists have been studying the flow of matter onto black holesusing data from the Indian Space Observatory AstroSat and other facilities. In their recentstudy, IUCAA has identified some of these black holes to possess masses ranging between 2to a few tens of times the mass of our sun.IUCAA scientists are probing environments of super-massive black holes in active galacticnuclei using multi-wavelength observations with Indian space observatory AstroSat and otherinternational missions. Main findings include (i) a truncated accretion disk around a 100 millionsolar mass black hole in an active galaxy using AstroSat observations, (ii) larger sizes ofaccretion disks around supermassive black holes than predicted from theory using NASA''sSwift observatory, (iii) high density accretion disk around supermassive black holes usingESA''s XMM-Newton observatory, (iv) accretion disks providing seed photons for generating Xrayemission in active galaxies using AstroSat observations (v) frequency of occurrence ofwinds/outflows in active galaxies using XMM-Newton observations, etc.Machine Learning and Big Data methods are used to distinguish astrophysical signal fromdetector noise in gravitational wave detectors for detecting binary black hole mergers, andIUCAA scientists have significantly increased the sensitivity of these discoveries.(d): The Department of Science & Technology (DST) has informed that Thirty Meter Telescope(TMT) project is a large telescope project sanctioned under the Mega Facilities for BasicResearch scheme of DST as an extramural grant. India is participating in the construction ofTMT through Cash and in-kind contributions. The project is funded and implemented jointly byDST and Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). DST is the Lead Agency for the project. IndianInstitute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, IUCAA, Pune and Aryabhatta Research Institute ofObservational Sciences, Nainital are the three lead institutions from the country forimplementation of TMT project. So far, DST has released Rs. 137.486 crore and Rs.108.85crore have been released by DAE to IIA, Bengaluru for implementation of TMT project.******
