ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing Van Dhan Vikas Karyakaram through TRIFED (Tribal Co-Operative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited) to promote value-addition and marketing of tribal products and minor forest products (MFP) catering to increase in the income of tribal MFP gatherers. State-wise number of beneficiaries and the sales generated through these Van Dhan Vikas Kendra (VDVK) clusters is at Annexure. This being a demand-driven scheme, the proposals for establishment of VDVKCs are received from State Governments. Funds have been provided by TRIFED to the respective Implementing Agencies of State Governments to implement the Karyakaram as per the laid down objectives. No beneficiary State Government has so far formally submitted any report regarding non-fulfilling of the objective of the Karyakram. Till date no proposal for VDVKCs has been received from the State of West Bengal.(d) Ministry of Tribal Affairs envisages to set up 500 VDVKCs each year through TRIFED for generating additional income to the village level primary SHG units through value-addition and marketing of tribal products and minor forest products.
