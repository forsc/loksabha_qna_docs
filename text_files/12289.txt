The Act, inter-alia, provides for measurers to prevent accidents and occupational disease and requires provisions of some basic amenities to mines workers employed in those mines which are notified under Mines Act 1952. The Illegal mines do not come under the purview of the Mines Act, 1952. (b) to (e):	The Meghalaya mine accident which took place in 2018-19 was not a notified mine under the Mines Act, 1952 and thus does not fall in the jurisdiction of the Central Government.  State Governments/UT Administrations are empowered to take action against such illegal mining and consequently to prevent such accidents in these mining. 		Hence, the data in respect of number of deaths, bodies retrieved and compensation paid in the Meghalaya mine accident is not available with Ministry of Labour and Employment.******
