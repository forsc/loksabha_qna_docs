ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c)  Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts.       Flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Main reason for floods in the State of Bihar is on account of increased discharge in rivers of North Bihar like Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas which mainly lie in Nepal. The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR) (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. Broad outcomes of the dialogues mechanism are given below: i)    Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been set up jointly by India and Nepal for execution, operation and maintenance of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada. The  DPR of the project has been prepared by M/s WAPCOS Limited. ii)    Survey and investigation works including preparation of DPR of Sapta Kosi High Dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion scheme proposed in the Sapta Kosi basin in Nepal has been undertaken jointly by India and Nepal.*****
