                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a)	As informed by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Uttar Pradesh, the status of coverage of population (as per census 2011) by Banking Outlets in the State of Uttar Pradesh and Prayagraj District is given below:Banking Outlets	State of UP	Prayagraj	No. of banking outlets	Banking outlet per lakh population (Pop. – 19.95 crore)	No. of banking outlets	Banking outlet per lakh population (Pop. – 59.54 lakhsTotal Brick & Mortar Branches 	19056	10	620	10Bank Mitras (incl.

Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.To ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch / Business Correspondent/India Post Payments Bank), within 5 kilometres of all inhabited villages, the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based App., namely, Jan DhanDarshak App (JDD App) developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC). Banks upload the GIS location of their branches, Business Correspondents (BCs) and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) on the app. As on 28.02.2022, as per GIS data, there are 97,211 mapped inhabited villages in the State of Uttar Pradesh and all of these villages have at least one banking outlet within a distance of 5 kilometers. (c) to (e) As informed by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Startup India is a flagship initiative of Government of India, launched on 16th January 2016 and aims at building a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and Startups in the country. Under this initiative, as on 07th March 2022, a total of 5,833 eligible entities have been recognised as startup from the State of Uttar Pradesh with 130 startups from Prayagraj. The data of startup recognition, under Start up India, is compiled industry/sector-wise and not product wise.  List of industry-wise number of startups recognized by DPIIT is at Annexure.No guidelines have been prescribed fixing the time limit for credit from banks under the Startup India Scheme. However, Government is providing assistance under this initiative, under the following two schemes:	i)  Fund of Funds for Startups Scheme	ii) Startup India Seed Fund SchemeUnder the Fund of Funds for Startups Scheme (FFS), a corpus of Rs.10,000 crore has been sanctioned, spread over the 14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles. The Scheme is operated and managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). However, no direct financial assistance to startups is provided, under this scheme. Instead, it supports SEBI- registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), who in turn invest money in growing Indian startups through equity and equity-linked instruments.Under the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS), Rs.945 crore has been sanctioned for a period of 4 years starting from 2021-22. The funds are released to Startups through approved Incubators.* * * * *  Annexure as referred to in part (c) to (e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2974 for 21.03.2022 regarding “Bank Branches in Uttar Pradesh”Industries	No. of Recognised startupsAdvertising	520Aeronautics Aerospace & Defence	568Agriculture	2974AI	1302Airport Operations	6Analytics	533Animation	64AR VR (Augmented + Virtual Reality)	361Architecture Interior Design	354Art & Photography	210Automotivep	1191Biotechnology	130Chemicals	493Computer Vision	199Construction	2246Dating Matrimonial	53Design	505Education	4343Enterprise Software	1310Events	274Fashion	784Finance Technology	2035Food & Beverages	2958Green Technology	1545Healthcare & Lifesciences	6016House-Hold Services	445Human Resources	1231Indic Language Startups	161Internet of Things	1207IT Services	8203Logistics	207Marketing	1359Media & Entertainment	1039Nanotechnology	114Non- Renewable Energy	1307Other Specialty Retailers	457Others	1276Passenger Experience	5Pets & Animals	161Professional & Commercial Services	3224Real Estate	518Renewable Energy	1726Retail	1565Robotics	380Safety	207Security Solutions	666Social Impact	436Social Network	529Sports	319Technology Hardware	2006Telecommunication & Networking	630Textiles & Apparel	853Toys and Games	102Transportation & Storage	1105Travel & Tourism	1027Waste Management	270Not Specified	1301Grand Total	65010
