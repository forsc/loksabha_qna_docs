                                                                             THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                   (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b): Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) as a sub-scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) to provide dignified living to urban migrants/ poor near their workplace. This scheme is being implemented through two models as under:i.	Model-1: Utilizing existing Government funded vacant houses constructed under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) to convert into ARHCs through Public Private Partnership (PPP) or by Public Agencies;ii.	Model-2: Construction, Operation & Maintenance of ARHCs by Public/ Private Entities on their own available vacant land. Under Model-1 of the scheme, out of total 83,534 existing government funded vacant houses constructed under JnNURM and RAY in different States/ Union Territories (UTs), 5,478 houses have been converted into ARHCs and 7,483 units are under process of getting converted as ARHCs and are at various stages of completion across the country. The State/ UTs-wise details are at Annexure. (c): Under Model-2 of the scheme, MoHUA have issued Expression of Interest (EoI) three times so far to invite proposals from Public/ Private Entities to construct ARHCs on their own available vacant land. In response, so far, proposals for construction of 78,885 new ARHC units have been sanctioned. The State-wise details of proposals sanctioned under Model-2 is at Annexure. (d) & (e): No, Sir. There are no fixed city-wise targets. This is demand based scheme. (f): No, Sir. As per scheme guidelines, affordable rent of ARHCs is fixed by the local authority based on a local survey.  (g): Under Model-1 of the scheme, the required investment to Repair/ Retrofit the existing buildings to make it livable will be made by Concessionaire which would be recovered through rental income during the concession period i.e. 25 years. Under Model-2, the required investment for construction, operation and maintenance of ARHCs will be made by the Public/ private Entity which would be recovered through rental income during the project period of 25 years. However, MoHUA has provisioned for an additional grant in the form of Technology Innovation Grant (TIG) for projects using innovative & alternate technology. So far, TIG of ?175 crore has been approved by the Ministry for construction of 78,885 new ARHC units, out of which ?83.26 crore has been released to Building Material and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) for further releases to Public/ Private Entities.                                            ******
