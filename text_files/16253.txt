However, there were not many buyers as storagewas very limited and it led to people selling it off even at negative prices. However, thisnegative price was applicable only for one day and next day June WTI contract, was tradingaround $ 20 a barrel.(c) & (d) The Central Government has announced various measures to boost theeconomy and improve the demand of Oil including the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan PhaseI-V.x-x-x-x-x
