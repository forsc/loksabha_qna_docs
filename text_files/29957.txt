 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ---   Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) in respect of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 152 for reply on 08.12.2021 regarding Coal Gasification asked by  Dr. Bharatiben Dhirubhai Shiyal and Dr. Arvind Kumar Sharma. (a): Government has prepared a plan to achieve coal gasification and liquefaction of 100MT of coal by 2030. (b): In order to achieve gasification of 100 MT of coal by 2030, Ministry of Coal had organised an international webinar on 31.8.2020 under the chairmanship of Honorable Minister of Coal wherein NITI Aayog, representatives of various Ministries, research organisations, private and public sector companies and technology providers had participated. Based on the recommendations a draft Mission document was prepared and was discussed with stakeholders during the consultation organised 8th June 2021. The final Mission document has now been uploaded on the website of Ministry of Coal. Further, to incentivise coal gasification, Ministry of coal has formulated a policy wherein, a provision has been made for 50% rebate in revenue share for all future commercial coal block auctions for the coal used for gasification purpose provided the coal quantity used for gasification is at least 10% of total coal production. Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of Member, NITI Aayog has been constituted to oversee the program and taking policy decisions and implementation committee involving all industry stakeholders under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal to take up and monitor progress of such projects. As per Mission document, In the gasification projects, low ash coal will be gasified through projects identified by CIL. Five projects have been identified by CIL and PDIL has been awarded to prepare pre-feasibility reports. (c), (d) and (e): No Sir. Underground coal gasification is not a proven environmentally sustainable technology. Resultantly, Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) technology is not proven commercially across world. The pilot project at Australia was dropped due to economic and environmental concerns. As such UCG is not under consideration for adoption in India.  *****
