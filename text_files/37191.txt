                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a): The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has been implementing various schemes/programmes for sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture in the country and the schemes implemented are as below-(i) Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)” with  highest ever estimated investment of ?20050 crore with a Central share of Rs. 9407 crores, State share of Rs. 4880 crores and Beneficiaries contribution of Rs. 5763 crores,for a period of 5 years with effect from the financial year 2020-21 to FY 2024-25 in all States/Union Territories,(ii)Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) with a total funds size of Rs 7522.48 crore for providing concessional finance for creation of fisheries infrastructure.(iii) Extension of “Kisan Credit Card (KCC)” facility to fishers and fish farmers, in the year 2018-19 to help them to meet their working capital needs for pisciculture. (b): PMMSY is implemented with the objectives (i) to harness the fisheries potential in a sustainable, responsible, inclusive and equitable manner, (ii) enhancing the fish production and productivity, (iii) modernizing and strengthening of value chain - post-harvest management and quality improvement, (iv) doubling fishers and fish farmers’ incomes and generation of employment, and (v) enhancing contribution to Agriculture GVA and exports. While FIDF aims to (i) create infrastructure in fisheries, (ii) reduce post-harvest losses and improve domestic marketing facilities, (iii) to bridge the resource gap and facilitate completion of ongoing infrastructure projects. PMMSY is implemented with effect from the financial year 2020-21 and the budget allocation of Rs. 700 crore was made during 2020-21 and Rs. 1200 crore during 2021-22. FIDF being an interest subvention scheme, a budgetary provision of Rs. 10 crore each during the previous and current financial year has been made. The intended beneficiary of PMMSY are: Fishers, Fish farmers, Fish workers and Fish vendors, Fisheries Development corporations, Self Help Groups (SHGs)/ Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) in fisheries sector, Fisheries cooperatives, Fisheries Federations, Entrepreneurs and private firms, Fish Farmers Producer Organisations/ Companies (FFPOs/ Cs), SCs/ STs/ Women/ Differently abled persons, State Governments/ UTs and their entities including State Fisheries Development Boards (SFDB), Central Government and its entities.  Further, the intended beneficiaries of FIDF are State Government/ Union Territories (UTs) and their entities including Private Sector.  (c): Since PMMSY has been introduced in the year 2020-21, it is premature to undertake its impact assessment study within short span of its implementation. Further, no impact assessment study has been undertaken for FIDF,as its implementation period has not ended.(d): The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying during the past three financial years, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, has accorded approval to the proposal worth of Rs. 1356.21 crores to the Government of Tamil Nadu for development of fisheries and infrastructure in the State.
