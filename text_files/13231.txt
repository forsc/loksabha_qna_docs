The Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. An advisory specifically on safety of journalists was issued to States/UTs on 20th October 2017 requesting them to strictly enforce the law to ensure safety and security of media persons. These advisories are available on the Ministry’s website: www.mha.gov.in. ********
