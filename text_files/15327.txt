Such categories do not include students living outside their State. Further, the Commission has already made provision regarding enrolment of students who live outside their place of ordinary residence. A student, if otherwise eligible, living in a hostel or mess or lodge more or less continuously, going back to their normal home or place of residence only for short periods, can be held to be ordinarily resident in the place where the hostel or mess or lodge is situated. However, if they so wish, they have the option of retaining their enrolment at their residence with their parents instead. However, the course pursued by the said students should be recognized by Central/State Governments/Boards/ Universities/Deemed Universities and such courses'' should be of not less than 1 year duration. Such students who want to enrol themselves at the hostel/mess will have to attach a bonafide declaration duly certified by the Headmaster / Principal / Director / Registrar / Dean of the educational institution in form 6 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960.(d): No, Sir.(e): Does not arise.
