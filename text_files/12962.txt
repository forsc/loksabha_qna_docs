                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance(a) and (b):  The details of the month-wise ratio of total households who opened their bank account under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and the number of households not having bank accounts along with their ratio are not maintained centrally. As reported by banks, 38.13 crore bank accounts have been opened under PMJDY as on 19.02.2020. State-wise number of accounts opened under PMJDY as on 19.02.2020 is at Annexure. (c) As informed by banks, safety measures like not sharing the debit card details with anyone is incorporated in the Debit Card User Guide provided to the customers at the time of issue of Debit Cards. At the time of handing over of the debit card, customers are educated for the safety measures like not sharing critical information to anyone. Such information is also sent through periodic SMSs to registered mobile numbers of card holders. Further, as per Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Master Circular on ‘Customer Service in Banks’ dated 01.07.2015 while opening the Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts (BSBDA), which include PMJDY accounts, banks educate such customers about the ATM Debit Card, ATM PIN and risk associated with it. For the purpose of creating awareness, RBI conducts Electronics Banking Awareness And Training (e-BAAT) programs at various locations wherein audience is sensitised about safe digital payments. Also, a campaign named “RBI Kehta Hai” is being undertaken through print and electronic media to create awareness in this regard.(d) As per RBI’s Master Circular on ‘Customer Service in Banks’ dated July 1, 2015 banks make available all printed material used by retail customers including account opening forms, pay-in-slips, passbooks, etc., in trilingual form i.e., English, Hindi and the concerned Regional Language.
