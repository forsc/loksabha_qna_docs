ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING; AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS.(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (d):	The Competition Commission of India (‘Commission’) has recently released a report titled ‘Market Study on the Pharmaceutical Sector in India: Key Findings and Observations’.  The study has been conducted with the overarching objective of understanding the factors that influence price competition in the pharmaceutical sector, specific realms of pharmaceutical distribution including the emergence of e-pharmacies, the role of trade associations, trade margins and drug pricing, and the prevalence of branded generic drugs in India and its implications for competition. Since the pharmaceutical sector is a regulated sector, the study also attempted to explore the areas of interface between regulation and competition with a view to ascertain the Commission’s advocacy priorities. The report summarizes the main findings of the study and the Commission’s observations thereon. The insights gained from the market study would contribute significantly to the design of the pharma market in India to help attain the objective of affordable medicines for all.  The report is accessible in the public domain at www.cci.gov.in. ******
