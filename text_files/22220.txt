ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	& (b) : Government has not conducted any study recently on level of distress migration in the country from rural areas. However, migration of workers from one State to another State is a continuous process and the migrant workers keep on moving from one State to other States in search of work. As per the information provided by Ministry of Labour & Employment, on the basis of data reported by the States/UTs, during the Covid-19 situation, a total of 1,14,30,968 inter-state migrant workers returned to their home states. State-wise break up is enclosed at the Annexure.(c): The Ministry of Rural Development, inter alia, is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana –National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, development of infrastructure in rural areas, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities.  	Besides the schemes/ programmes of MoRD mentioned above, major schemes of other Ministries for generating employment and skill development of the rural population are given below:(i). Prime Minister’s Employment Generation (PMEGP): The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises has been implementing a credit-linked subsidy programme named Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) since 2008-09 with Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) as nodal agency at the national level for generating employment in the country by setting up of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth. (ii) Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY): The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) had launched Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in the year 2015. The objective of this Skill Certification Scheme is to enable a large number of Indian Youth to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills will also be assessed and certified under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of the Scheme. RPL mainly focuses on the individuals engaged in unregulated sectors.All these measures encourage people in rural areas to earn their livelihood and raise their quality of life near their places of residence and hence, act as a deterrent to migration of rural population to cities.Apart from the above, in order to safeguard the interest of the migrant workers, the Central Government had enacted the Inter-state Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979. This Act has now been subsumed in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code has been notified on 29.09.2020.  The above mentioned code commonly known as OSH Code, provides for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievances redressal mechanisms, protection from abuse and exploitation, enhancement of the skills and social security to all category of organized and unorganized workers including Migrant workers.  The Code is applicable to every establishment in which 10 or more inter-state migrant workers are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding 12 months.   ******
