ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a)  Panchayat being a State subject, providing infrastructure facilities to Gram Panchayat (GPs) is primarily the responsibility of concerned State Government. However, under the restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), this Ministry has been supplementing the efforts of State governments by providing financial support to States for certain infrastructural facilities such as Gram Panchayat Bhawans, computers and peripherals for GPs on a limited scale on demand from the states along with funding the capacity building of Panchayati Raj Institutions. (b) As steps towards modernisation of district and village panchayats, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is implementing e-GramSwaraj and other e-Governance Applications under e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) which addresses planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licences, etc. thereby improving transparency, accountability and governance at Panchayat level. No funds are released to States/ UTs including the State of Maharashtra for these activities.***
