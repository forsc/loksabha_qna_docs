ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): As informed by the National Medical Commission (NMC), the National Medical Commission (NMC) were requested by Non-medical teachers and scientists not to reduce permissible percentages in new MSR for UG Medical Education. The National Medical Commission (NMC) a statutory body has been constituted to replace MCI. The NMC has became operational on 25th September, 2020 and has informed that the as per the Minimum Requirement Regulations, 2020, percentage of appointment of non-medical teachers in the Department of Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology has been made to 15% and fresh appointment of non-medical teaching staff in the Department of Pharmacology and Biochemistry from the academic year 2021-22 onwards will not be permissible. However, existing non-medical teachers will continue to be recognized.The NMC has informed that they have revised the Regulations on the ground that the new Competency Based Medical Education curriculum has early clinical exposure from 1st year and requires persons with medical qualification to conduct these integrated teaching sessions. Further, Section 22(3) of the NMC Act, 2019 prescribes that a person who is aggrieved by any decision of an Autonomous Board may prefer an appeal to the NMC against such decision and in case a person is aggrieved by the decision of the NMC, he/she may prefer an appeal under section 9(6) of the Act to the Central Government against such decision.
