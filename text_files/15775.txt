While allocating the fund under JJM to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants. The fund provided to the States under JJM is to be utilized by giving priority to water quality-affected habitations.Water being a State subject, initiatives for water management, including its quality is primarily the responsibility of the States.
