ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	Under the Aspirational Districts Programme, the Government of India has identified 112 districts which in past has shown relatively slow progress in key social and economic indicators. The Programme aims at rapid transformation of these districts across sectors which are critical for improving quality of life or economic productivity of citizens and these sectors are Health and Nutrition, School Education, Basic Infrastructure, Agriculture and Water Resources and Financial Inclusion & Skill Development.(b)	These 112 Aspirational Districts are spread across 26 States and 1 Union Territory. The State-wise list of all 112 Aspirational Districts, including in Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Gujarat, is attached as Annexure – I. The selection of these 112 Districts was done through a transparent process on the basis of published data available during launch of the programme in 2018. List of data sets and the weight attached to them for selection of these districts is provided at Annexure - II. (c)	As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, infusion of additional fund is not envisaged. However, in order to foster a competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on the basis of performance is envisaged. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded ?10 crores and ?5 crores respectively. The first ranker   from each of the five sectors is awarded ?3 crores each. As per this method, a total of approximately ? 519.02cr has been disbursed for projects formulated by 91 Districts  across all sectors under focus in the Programme. These projects are in various stages of implementation. A detailed statement regarding the above is attached at Annexure-III. (d)	As stated above, the Aspirational Districts Programme is over and above the existing schemes of the Central and the State Governments concerned in a district and as such it is in the nature of additionality.(e)	Under the Programme, 49 key performance indicators have been selected across the five sectors under focus, and a district’s performance is monitored on the basis of progress made on these indicators. A list of these indicators is provided at Annexure–IV. (f)	At present there is no proposal to include any additional district. As stated above, the Aspirational Districts were selected on the basis of their relatively less progress in key social and economic indicators on the basis of published data. Araria district in Bihar is already a part of the Programme. As regards districts of Alwar, Sikar, Satara, Solapur, Latur, Rajsamanad, and Jalore, the 112 districts that were selected had lower overall progress compared to the districts that were selected in their respective States in 2018.*****Annexure – IList of 112 Aspirational DistrictsS.
