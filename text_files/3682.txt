ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	 & (b) The Government is aware that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has notified the new Regulatory Framework for Broadcasting and Cable Services. The DTH Operators have, in general, implemented the New Regulatory Framework. (c)  TRAI has not deferred the date of implementation of the DTH Rules. The new regulatory framework has been implemented with effect from 29th December, 2018.  However, keeping in view the consumer convenience and to provide sufficient time to consumers to exercise the options for the new tariff packs, TRAI provided time until 31st March, 2019 to consumers for conveying their informed choices to service providers.(d)  No incidence indicating that the DTH Operators are not adhering to the TRAI’s norms with regards to pricing of channels, has come to the notice of TRAI. As per the new regulatory framework, every broadcaster is required to offer all its channels on a-la-carte basis and declare maximum retail price (MRP), per month, payable by a subscriber for each of its pay channel offered on a-la-carte basis. Further, all the Distribution Platform Operators including DTH operators are mandated to display of prices of all channels on Electronic Program Guide (EPG), which are visible to all the consumers watching TV.(e)  TRAI has taken several initiatives for raising awareness of consumers and facilitating them in selecting the channels of their choice. For this purpose, service providers have created their website and APPs. Consumers can also provide their choice to call center of service providers and through their local cable operators. TRAI has developed the My Channel Application, available on TRAI’s website, which enables consumers to select the channels of their choice and assess their monthly bill.  TRAI has undertaken an extensive campaign for generating consumer awareness about the new regulatory framework. Several advertisements have been published in newspaper of various languages to make consumers aware about the various ways to exercise options.*****
