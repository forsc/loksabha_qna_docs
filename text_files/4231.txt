The Mining Surveillance System (MSS) has been successful in curbing Illegal Mining activities in the country. MSS is a satellite-based monitoring system which aims to detect illegal mining activity through automatic remote-sensing detection technology.  The system records any landform disturbances upto 500m beyond the lease boundary and generates trigger, which is investigated by the State Government and necessary action is taken by them. Almost all mining leases of major minerals in the country have been mapped on MSS. In the initial phase(Phase-I), based on the satellite imageries, the data has been analysed and a total 296 triggers for mining leases of major minerals have been generated across the country in the year 2016-17. Out of the 296 triggers, the respective State Governments have verified 287 triggers.  Out of these 287 triggers, in 47 cases, unauthorized mining has been detected / confirmed. State-wise, mineral-wise breakup of unauthorized mining after verification by State as on December 2017 is given as Annexure-I. In the second phase of MSS, based on satellite imageries of the year 2017-18, the data has been analysed and 52 triggers generated. Field verification of 45 triggers have been carried out by State Governments as on 03/07/2019.  In 4 cases,  un-authorized mining was detected. The State-wise details are given as Annexure-II. The State Governments were also requested to extend the MSS for the mining leases of minor minerals.  Some State Governments have mapped few mining leases of minor minerals on pilot basis.  In total 130 triggers were generated for minor minerals, out of which 104 triggers have been verified and in 9 cases un-authorized mining have been detected. State-wise details as on 03/07/2019 is enclosed as Annexure-III.***** Annexure- I State-wise detail of  triggers for mining leases of Major Minerals is as under (2016-17)State	Total Triggers	Total Inspection	Un-authorized mining cases detected ANDHRA PRADESH	29	29	4CHHATTISGARH	6	6	1GOA	42	42	12GUJARAT	32	32	12HIMACHAL PRADESH	11	11	-JHARKHAND	1	1	-KARNATAKA	35	35	1MADHYA PRADESH	46	46	5MAHARASHTRA	8	7	1MEGHALAYA	8	1	-ODISHA	20	20	-RAJASTHAN	23	22	1TAMIL NADU	29	29	10TELANGANA	6	6	-Total	296	287	47Annexure- IIState-wise detail of  triggers for mining leases of major minerals is as under                     (as on 03.07.2019)State	Total Triggers	Total Inspection	Un-authorized mining cases detectedANDHRA PRADESH	8	8	1CHHATTISGARH	4	3	-GUJARAT	7	7	1HIMACHAL PRADESH	2	-	-JAMMU & KASHMIR	2	2	-JHARKHAND	1	-	-KARNATAKA	4	4	-MADHYA PRADESH	4	4	-MAHARASHTRA	3	3	1ODISHA	2	2	-RAJASTHAN	8	8	-TAMIL NADU	7	4	1Total	52	45	4 Annexure- IIIState-wise details of triggers for mining leases of minor minerals is as under(on 03.07.2019)State	Total Triggers	Total Inspection	Un-authorized mining cases detectedANDHRA PRADESH	8	8	-CHHATTISGARH	4	-	-GOA	3	3	-GUJARAT	27	27	4HARYANA	4	2	-JHARKHAND	11	4	-KARNATAKA	12	12	-KERALA	5	3	3MAHARASHTRA	2	-	-RAJASTHAN	37	34	1TAMIL NADU	10	8	1TELANGANA	3	3	-UTTAR PRADESH	4	-	-Total	130	104	9
