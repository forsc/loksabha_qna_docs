NITI Aayog and Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs).  The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project has been prepared.  As per DPR  the cost of the project is approx. `1273.74 crore with Rate of Return             (-)3.19%.  Project being financially unviable, State Government of Odisha has been requested to provide land free of cost and share 50% cost of the project.  Response of State Govt. of Odisha is awaited.(c) & (d):   Presently, Koraput is connected to Raipur and Bhubaneswar by 1 pair of trains service each.  There is no proposal to introduce new train services between these sectors, at present due to operational and resource constraints.*****
