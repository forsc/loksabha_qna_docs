ANSWER




 (a) & (b):         The details of total quantity of Remdesivir injection manufactured so far by the pharmaceutical companies are as follows: Sl. No.	Name of the Pharmaceutical company	Total quantity of  Remdesivir manufactured for market till 08-09-20201.	M/s Mylan Laboratories limited	500,000 vials2.	M/s Hetero Healthcare	14,46,000 Vials3.	M/s Jubilant Generics Limited	150,000 vials4.	M/s Cipla*(as on 28-08-2020)	143,329 vials5.	M/s Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories	13286 units6.	M/s  Cadila Healthcare Limited	1,86,957 vials The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has not received any report that Pharma companies are not being able to match the current demand.(c) to (e):         Initially, CDSCO has granted permission to M/s Klinera to import and market Remdesivir injection 100 mg/20 ml and Remdesivir 100mg/vial lyophilised powder of M/s Gilead for Restricted Emergency Use in the country for treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and children hospitalised with severe disease subject to various conditions / restrictions. Based on the above import and marketing permission, M/s Klinera has submitted application for import registration certificate and import license to CDSCO for which firm needs to submit additional documents. Subsequently, CDSCO has granted permission to manufacture and market Remdesivir Injectable Formulations for restricted emergency use in the country, subject to various conditions and restrictions to the following manufacturers: S. No	Firm Name	Permission Date1	M/s. Hetero	20/06/20202	M/s. Cipla	20/06/20203	M/s Mylan	02/07/20204	M/s Jubilant	22/07/20205	M/s Cadila Healthcare Ltd	06/08/20206	M/s Dr. Reddy’s	10/08/2020 Further, CDSCO had received applications from M/s MSN Labs and M/s BDR Pharmaceutical limited for which applicant need to submit additional documents. (f):       The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes/revises the ceiling price of Scheduled medicines specified in First Schedule of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). The NPPA also monitors the prices of non-scheduled medicines so that their MRP does not increase by more than 10 percent of the MRP during preceding twelve (12) months. Further, Remdesivir is included under ‘Investigational Therapy category’ and is being used as off-Label and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) drug. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given conditional license to this formulation for “restricted emergency use”. These medicines are being administered after obtaining consent of the patient. Hence, full drug status has not been granted to these drugs for COVID-19 treatment. As noted above, presently, there are six manufacturers of Remdesivir Injection and its pricing is being governed by market dynamics. Initially, the manufacturers of Remdesivir Injection namely M/s Mylan Laboratories, M/s Hetero Healthcare Limited and M/s Cipla Limited were advised by Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to upload information regarding distributors and supply chain details along with the quantities on their website, so as to prevent black-marketing and overcharging of the drug. 	On receipt of complaints regarding selling of Remdesivir at a price above MRP, necessary instructions were issued to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to advise the manufacturers to start a 24x7 helpline for patients and their families in case the medicine is not available or higher price is being charged. In compliance, manufacturers started helpline number and displayed it on website. Further, contact details of manufacturers were provided on the website of the NPPA i.e. www.nppaindia.nic.in, to facilitate information regarding availability of medicine for the public. The NPPA also set-up a Control Room with Helpline No. 1800111255 and e-mail monitoring-nppa@gov.inon 20th March 2020 to respond to queries and complaints relating to COVID-19.  The issues raised are addressed and resolved; solutions are provided and forwarded to concerned authorities for redressal and followed up for final resolution. *******
