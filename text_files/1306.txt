                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)	Various Organizations/ Institutes, from time to time, have been publishing estimates of mortality/ morbidity attributable to environmental pollutionbased on models, simulations and extrapolations. These estimates are, however, based on models, simulations and extrapolations. Though air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.(b)	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) along with State Pollution Control Boardsand Pollution Control Committeesare monitoring ambient air quality at 779 monitoring stations located in 339 cities/towns covering 29 states and 6 union territories across the country under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). CPCB does not rank cities w.r.t. air pollution. However, CPCB has identified 102 non-attainment cities, based on ambient air quality levels exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the period 2011 – 2015 and World Health Organisation report 2014/2018.(c)	The Government has taken several steps to address air pollution,which inter alia, includethe following: • notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards,• revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time,• setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality,• introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.),• ethanol blending,• launching of National Air Quality index,• leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards,• notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules,• banning of burning of biomass,• streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate,• issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution,• installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries,• notification of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and NCR,• Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR,•launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP),• organization of clean air campaigns, etc.(d) and (e )The Government has taken various initiatives to control air pollution in Karnataka including Bengaluru, which inter alia, include framing of city specific action plans to  control vehicular emission, road dust, biomass/ crop/ garbage/ Municipal Solid Waste burning, construction activities, industrial emission, etc. *****
