MSP is fixed for 22 mandated agricultural crops which are not perishable and are amenable to storage.  On the other hand, tea leaves are highly perishable plantation crops and quality deteriorates with storage.  In order to ensure fair price realization to the tea growers especially the small growers, Tea Board in the year 2004 introduced Price Sharing Formula (PSF) which envisaged fair sharing of sale proceeds between the grower and the manufacturer in a certain ratio based on the cost of production of green leaf and made tea. Further, in order to ensure proper implementation of PSF, Tea Board also notifies Minimum Benchmark Price (MBP) for each tea growing districts including Kishanganj at the beginning of the every month. (b):	The Tea Board under the Tea Development & Promotion Scheme is extending financial assistance to the tea industry in the country, including the Purnea and Kisanganj Districts of Bihar, for uprooting and replanting, rejuvenation, pruning, irrigation, assistance to Self Help Groups (SHGs), field mechanization, assistance to Farmers’ Producers Organizations (FPOs), annual award for SHGs & FPOs, setting up of new factories by FPOs, setting up mini factories, workshop/training, development & promotion of organic farming/organic conversion, etc.  (c):	The Tea Board has reported that there is one tea factory namely ‘DRDA Tea Factory’ in the Kishanganj District owned by the State Government of Bihar.  The said Government Factory was established in the year 2004 under Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana at Kalidas Kismat, Pothia Block, Kishanganj and is functioning.
