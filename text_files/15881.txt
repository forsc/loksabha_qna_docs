GSR 128 dated 18.02.2020 (effective from 23.02.2020) as a part of Government of India’s Ease of Doing Business (EODB) initiatives.  The new Web Form christened ‘SPICe+’ (pronounced ‘SPICe Plus’) has replaced the existing PDF based SPICe form. The SPICe+ web-form offers 10 services by three Central Government Ministries and Departments (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Ministry of Labour & Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance) and One State Government (Maharashtra), thereby saves as many procedures, time and cost for Starting a Business in India. It also enables opening of a Bank Account for the newly Incorporated Company. It is an integrated Web Form and has two parts viz. Part A-for Name reservation for new companies and Part B- offering a bouquet of registrations viz. (i) Incorporation (ii) DIN allotment (iii) Mandatory issue of PAN (iv) Mandatory issue of TAN (v) Mandatory issue of EPFO registration (vi) Mandatory issue of ESIC registration (vii) Mandatory issue of Profession Tax registration (Maharashtra) (viii) Mandatory Opening of Bank Account for the Company and (ix) Allotment of GSTIN (if so applied for). Users may either choose to submit Part-A for reserving a name first and thereafter submit Part B for incorporation & other registrations or file Part A and B together at one go for incorporating a new company and availing the bouquet of registrations as above. The new web form facilitates On-screen filing and real time data validation for seamless incorporation of companies. The Government has taken various steps for creating awareness for the said web-form including convening webinars in consultation with the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) & the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and hosting of prior notice about the uploading of aforesaid web-form on the MCA21 portal and in the Print Media. **********
