                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	“Public Health and Hospitals” is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of State Governments through technical and financial support. Under National Health Mission (NHM), support is provided to States /UTs to strengthen their health care systems including support for dialysis services, on the basis of proposals received from the States in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).The States where Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Program (PMNDP) has not been implemented are   Meghalaya and Chhattisgarh.   The state of Meghalaya has floated the tender multiple times to finalize service provider  for providing dialysis services under Public Private Partnership mode in the state, but the bids were non responsive. In Chhattisgarh, contract has already been signed with the service provider for operationalization of dialysis services on PPP mode.(d) & (e):	Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) has 1392 packages and one unspecified surgical package. Out of these, three packages pertain to dialysis such as Haemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis and  Arteriovenous shunt for the beneficiaries. Dialysis may be required to cover an eventuality whereby a patient admitted for treatment of some other disease is required to undergo this procedure. Besides this, an AB PM-JAY beneficiary may be able to get the dialysis done nearer to his residence at an empaneled hospital also.
