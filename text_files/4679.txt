There is no proposal at this juncture to de-link students from the regular stream of education and establish an independent University/Board to protect these students of proper schooling and certification/graduation while purely engaged in sports training under the Khelo India Scheme, as financial provision has been made under the Scheme to support schooling of children who have been selected for training thereunder.(d) A total of 2437 sportspersons have been identified under the Talent Search and Development Vertical of the Khelo India Scheme, including from rural areas. This vertical provides for selection of players through a three-tier structure consisting of Talent Scouting Committee, Talent Identification and Development Committee for training, with final selection done with the approval of a High Power Committee (HPC).(e) Participation in the Khelo India Games is State-wise and not district-wise.
