ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c) 	The Ministry is in the process of linking and integrating all the Missions and Posts abroad with the Passport Seva Project (PSP). As on 14 November, 2019, the Ministry has integrated the passport issuance systems in 42 Indian Missions/Posts abroad in Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, France, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, New Zealand, Oman, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the United States of America into the Passport Seva Project. This will facilitate holders of Indian passports to apply for a fresh passport or renew their existing passport from an Indian Mission or Post abroad.	As per statutory provisions, on the receipt of an application, the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA), after making such inquiry as it may consider necessary, shall issue the passport or travel documents. Fresh passports on ‘Tatkaal’ basis and those which are to be reissued by the Passport Issuing Authorities in the Embassies and Consulates abroad are to be issued within 7 working days in all such cases where no police verification is required.(d)	 In order to streamline, liberalize and ease the process of issue of passport, the Ministry of External Affairs has announced a number of steps in the realm of passport policy which is expected to benefit the citizens of India applying for a passport.The details of these steps can be seen at Annexure-I.(e) & (f) 	Yes, the Ministry has plans to issue chip enabled e-passports to citizens with advanced security features and better printing and paper quality. The Government has given its approval for procurement of electronic contactless inlays for manufacturing of e-passports to India Security Press (ISP), Nashik. In this regard, ISP, Nashik, has been authorized to float a Global three-stage tender for procurement of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)-compliant electronic contactless inlays along with its operating system which is required for manufacture of e-passports. Manufacture of e-passport with advanced security features and better printing and paper quality will commence on the successful completion of the tendering and procurement process by ISP, Nashik.	The personal particulars of the applicants would be digitally signed and stored in the chip. In case, anyone tampers with the chip, the system shall be able to identify it resulting in the failure of the passport authentication. Access of information is protected in a way that the chip cannot be read without physical possession of the passport.
