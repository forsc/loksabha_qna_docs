The Ministry has issued another set of instructions dated 14.05.2020 to the Nodal district authorities for settlement and closure of savings bank accounts of former MPs of Lok Sabha and former Members of Rajya Sabha so that unspent balance in their account can be used by the respective constituencies/ states where funds are required as per MPLADS guidelines.
