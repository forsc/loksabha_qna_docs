Petroleum & Natural GasRegulatory Board (PNGRB) is the authority to grant authorization to the entities for developingof CGD network in Geographical Areas (GAs) as per PNGRB Act, 2006. PNGRB identifiesGAs for authorizing the development of CGD network in synchronization with the developmentof natural gas pipeline connectivity and natural gas availability. About 232 GAs covering 407districts spread over 27 States/UTs including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have beenallowed for the development of CGD networks. Details of GAs authorized in the state of Bihar,Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are given at Annexure. PNGRB webhosted public notice dated04.02.2020 wherein a tentative list of 44 identified GAs to be covered under upcoming 11th CGDbidding round has been prepared which include cities of Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.(b) “Guidelines for sale of Biodiesel for blending with high speed diesel for transportationpurposes-2019” have been issued by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas vide Notificationdated 30.04.2019. As per the Notification to avoid entry of unscrupulous biodiesel suppliers, asuitable registration system for biodiesel manufactures, suppliers and sellers will be devised atthe State/UT Level.(c) and (e) PNGRB has authorized Green Gas Limited (GrGL) for development of CGDnetwork in Lucknow GA on 15.03.2016.

PNGRB is yet to authorize Gopalganj and Darbhanga districts ofBihar; Nanded, Hingoli and Yavatmal districts of Maharashtra for development of CGDnetwork. However, Gopalganj, Darbhanga and Hingoli districts have been included in thetentative list of GAs under the proposed 11th CGD bidding round. Nanded and Yavatmal districtsof Maharashtra will be covered for development of CGD network in future bidding rounds,based on the availability of natural gas pipeline/source and techno-commercial viability.(d) IOCL has no plan to lay a LPG gas pipeline in Gopalganj and Darbhanga districts ofBihar.****
