ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a) & (b) The Constitution of India envisages for Panchayats to function as institutions of self-government and prepare plans and implement schemes for economic development and social justice. Accordingly, Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) seeks to make Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) an effective, efficient and transparent vehicle for local governance, social change and public service delivery mechanism meeting the aspirations of local population through policy interventions, advocacy, capacity building, persuasion and financial support. To strengthen functioning of PRIs across the country, MoPR has launched eGramSwaraj (https://egramswaraj.gov.in), a user friendly web-based portal, which aims to bring in better transparency in the decentralised planning, progress reporting, financial management, work-based accounting and details of assets created. Further, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts i.e. receipts and expenditures of Gram Panchayats, MoPR has rolled out an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in). This application not only facilitates the auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining of audit records. This application streamlines the process for audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit-paras etc. and thus ensures proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats to improve transparency and accountability. (c) There is no scheme of Panchayat Raj Yojana in the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. MoPR has been providing programmatic support for strengthening of PRIs and capacity building of Elected Representatives and functionaries of PRIs to improve their functioning and effectiveness and make them self reliant. These programs are specifically focused on addressing the critical gaps that constrain the functioning of Panchayats, facilitating democratic planning and decision making through People’s participation, and strengthening the institutional structure of Panchayats.The Government has launched the core Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), which is being implemented from 2018-19 to 2021-22, with the primary aim of developing governance capabilities of PRIs to deliver on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya and emphasis on strengthening PRIs in the 117 Aspirational districts. The scheme of RGSA extends to all States/Union Territories including institutions of Rural Local Government in Non-Part-IX areas. Details of Annual Action Plan (AAP) approved of the States/Union Territories and funds released thereunder during the year 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and current year 2021-22 (upto month of July) under the scheme of RGSA are at Annexure.(d) Article 280 (3) (bb) of the Constitution of India provides for the Finance Commission to make recommendations regarding the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the resources of the Panchayats in the State on the basis of the recommendations made by the Finance Commission of the State. Accordingly, to improve the functioning of Panchayati Raj Institutions, funds have been recommended by Central Finance Commissions successively.  Funds released by Government in pursuance of recommendations of Central Finance Commission are as under:-(Figures in Rs.
