ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHARIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a & b) The Institutions of Eminence scheme was launched in the year 2017 with an aim to enable twenty academic institutions (ten each in public and private category) in the country to emerge as world class academic and research institutions. The enabling regulatory framework for this scheme is provided for in the UGC (Declaration of Government Educational Institutions as Institutions of Eminence) Guidelines, 2017 (IoE Guidelines, 2017) and UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 (IoE Regulations, 2017). Initially, there was no provision under the IoE Regulations, 2017 for set up of IoEs in other countries. The Government has recently amended the IoE, Regulations 2017 paving the way for Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities to start new off-shore campuses. These amendments have been notified vide UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) (Amendments), Regulations 2021 dated 01.01.2021.(c) Question does not arise.*****
