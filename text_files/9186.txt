ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region[Dr. Jitendra Singh] (a)	As per extant guidelines, each Central Ministry/Department is expected to spend 10% of its Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) as per prescribed norms in North Eastern Region (NER). However, no state-wise allocations are made and funds are released to the States based on requirements against sanctioned projects/schemes. In addition, Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER) and North Eastern Council (NEC) implement some schemes like Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), North East Road Sector Development Scheme (NERSDS) etc. for bridging the infrastructure gaps in certain identified sectors in the NER. Normative allocations under schemes of MDoNER and Schemes of NEC are done as per prescribed norms which inter alia include area; population; human development index, road density; percentage of census villages electrified; number of hospital beds; percentage of households having safe drinking water and completion rate of projects. Release of funds by MDoNER and NEC under their schemes is based on the progress of implementation of projects. The status of funds released during the last five years under the schemes of MDoNER and NEC is as under:-<pre>Sr. No.	State	Funds released during last Five Year (Rs. in crore) 	 	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-191	Arunachal Pradesh	251.52	197.76	195.68	284.72	210.782	Assam	293.59	323.34	359.12	313.24	453.203	Manipur	219.59	259.51	324.00	363.25	366.114	Meghalaya	157.15	193.69	194.54	298.00	118.925	Mizoram	95.22	166.06	133.03	242.03	192.006	Nagaland	157.41	160.28	177.68	195.11	108.927	Sikkim	126.16	77.61	111.18	110.40	160.688	Tripura	103.02	104.82	139.51	107.77	57.34 	Total States	1403.66	1483.07	1634.74	1914.52	1667.95 	Central Agencies	51.70	80.62	180.31	104.89	166.25 	Grand Total	1455.36	1563.69	1815.05	2019.41	1834.2</pre>(b)	Although in some cases, delays have been noticed in completion of the projects from the schedule, keeping in view various constraints like short working season, difficult terrain, etc., the pace of development in North Eastern States is considered satisfactory. Continuous efforts are being made for further improvement in the pace of development.(c) 	Does not pertain to Ministry of DoNER.
