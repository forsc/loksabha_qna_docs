ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) Assessment of adequacy of irrigation needs for the different parts of a State, as well as planning, funding, execution and maintaining irrigation projects to address the need for irrigation, is in the domain of the State Government concerned. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support and, in some cases, partial financial assistance for irrigation projects under the existing schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Measures have been taken to provide irrigation to tribal areas under the components of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) being implemented by this Ministry. Under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) & Command Area Development and Water Management Programme (CADWM), 21 out of 99 prioritized projects benefit the districts falling in tribal areas. Ultimate irrigation potential of these 21 projects is 10.73 lakh hectare, out of which irrigation potential of 6.99 lakh hectare has been created up to March, 2021. Similarly, under PMKSY- Har Khet Ko Pani, central assistance under Surface Minor Irrigation component is limited to hilly States and special areas, including tribal areas. Further, Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies component of PMKSY-Har Khet Ko Pani has been extended to tribal areas with funding pattern of 60% central assistance, as against 25% central assistance to general areas. There is also a preference for scheduled tribe farmers under Groundwater Development component of PMKSY being implemented by this Ministry. For Per Drop More Crop component of PMKSY being implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the operational guidelines envisage that 8.5% of the total allocation or in proportion of ST population in the district should be utilized for tribal sub-plan. Similarly for Watershed Development component of PMKSY being implemented by Department of Land Resources, 10% of allocation is to be spent on scheduled tribe component.*****
