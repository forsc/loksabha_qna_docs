ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b) Yes Sir. Considering the past history of terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir and in view of recent decisions that were being taken by the Parliament with regards to article 370, certain precautionary measures taken initially have already been substantially relaxed based on regular review of the ground situation. -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3551 FOR 10.12.2019(c) & (d) The Government of Jammu and Kashmir has reported that in order to prevent commission of offences involving breach of peace, activities prejudicial to the security of the State and maintenance of public order, certain persons including stone pelters, over ground workers (OGWs), separatists etc. were taken into preventive custody under statutory provisions by the concerned Magistrates and such preventive detentions are being regularly reviewed by the relevant statutory authorities. (e) On account of article 35A and many other constitutional ambiguities, the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh were being denied full rights enshrined in the Constitution of India and the benefits of various Central Laws that were being enjoyed by other citizens of the country were not available to them. After the Declaration issued by the President under article 370, based on recommendation of the Parliament, and reorganization of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh, all such aspects have been addressed. The people of these regions can now realize full potential like in other parts of the country. (f) The Government of Jammu and Kashmir has informed that restrictions under section 144 of CrPC remain only in certain areas depending on the ground situation. All the major newspapers are being published on a daily basis and that DTH and other TV Channels are functioning normally throughout Jammu and Kashmir. *****
