                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c) Although Health is a state subject, Government of India has provided the required technical support and has also supported the states through logistic and financial support to further strengthen the existing health infrastructure to tackle COVID-19 pandemic.To monitor the variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, initially, genomic sequencing was conducted through National Institute of Virology, Pune. Subsequently, Government of India established Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG) in December 2020 as a consortium of 10 laboratories of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Dept. of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).  The network of INSACOG laboratories has since been increased to 28.Analysis of the genomic data is a continuous and ongoing process. Periodic updates are shared with experts and states and are also regularly made available in the public domain through the media bulletin of INSACOG.After expert consultations it was concluded that Delta variant given its relatively high transmissibility has emerged as the dominant variant in India. However, the public health measures to manage the Pandemic in the field and the treatment protocol remain the same and the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and COVID appropriate behavior is to be followed at the field level.Initially in January 2021 when the vaccination program was initiated, around 2.35 lakh vaccinations were happening on an average on a daily basis.  Through continuous handholding of vaccine manufacturers leading to increased production, the same has now been augmented to an average of 38.42 lakh vaccinations on a daily basis during July 2021 (as on 28th July 2021). Continuous efforts are being made to increase the rate of vaccination to cover the eligible population.
