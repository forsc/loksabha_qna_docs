ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) &(b) According to the Government mandate, all lanes of fee plazas on National Highways except one lane have been declared as FASTag Lane of the fee plaza. As a result, waiting time in FASTag lanes has significantly reduced. However, the waiting time in the hybrid lane which accepts cash has increased because of non-FASTag vehicles. It has been observed that more waiting time in hybrid lanes vis-a-vis FASTag lanes has worked as a catalyst for adoption of FASTag. Waiting time will further reduce in future with further adoption of FASTag by non-FASTag vehicles.(c) to(e) As per Rule 9(3) of the National Highways fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 provides for- “A person who owns a mechanical vehicle registered for non-commercial purposes and uses it as such for commuting on a section of national highway, permanent bridge, bypass or tunnel, may obtain a pass, on payment of fee at base rate for the year 2007-2008 of Rupees one hundred and fifty per calendar month and revised annually in accordance with rule 5, authorising it to cross the fee plaza specified in such pass;	Provided that such pass shall be issued only if such driver, owner or person in charge of such mechanical vehicle resides within a distance of twenty kilometers from the fee plaza specified by such person and the use of such section of national highway, permanent bridge, bypass or tunnel, as the case may be does not extend beyond the fee plaza next to the specified fee plaza.	Provided further that no such pass shall be issued if a service road or alternative road is available for use by such driver, owner or person in charge of a mechanical vehicle.”	All discounts and monthly passes are applicable through FASTag. Such person may avail facility of FASTag monthly pass and can apply online for it at www.nhai.gov.in > FASTag monthly pass or ihmcl.com >FASTag> Buy Monthly FASTag Pass.*****
