The promotional measures are being implemented through a Central Sector Scheme namely ‘conservation and management of mangroves and coral reefs’ under National Coastal Mission Programme of the Ministry. In addition, the State Government of Gujarat is also taking adequate care in protecting mangroves which may come in danger due to any development project including ports. Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and rules under these acts as amended from time to time.(c) & (d) One unit on conservation of Kharai camel is in place under Network Programme on Animal Genetic Resources in collaboration with Sahjeevan, Bhuj in Kutch region of Gujarat by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) - National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR). Kharai population is being mapped in various parts of Gujarat along with providing technical know-how as well as some incentives. Milk marketing is also being facilitated and breeders are encouraged for milking. Moreover, an association of Kharai camel breeders have also been formed and they are being helped in policy matters like conservation of breeding areas of Mangroves. Kharai camel has been registered by the NBAGR and notified as native breed by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India, which would also help for formulating the policies for breed improvement by the State Government. ****
