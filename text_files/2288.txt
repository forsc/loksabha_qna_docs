                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): The list of airports which have been granted as a point of call to the designated airlines of different foreign countries are at Annexure. ;;(b) to (d): Sir, Andhra Pradesh Government had requested for grant of ''Point of Call'' status to Vijayawada Airport for UAE carriers-Emirates and Fly Dubai. The operation of foreign airlines to/from India is governed by provisions of the bilateral Air Services Agreement between the two countries. The designated carriers of UAE have upto 13 points of call in India. Presently; interior points of call in India are not being granted(except for already designated points of call) as this may adversely affect operations of Indian carriers and harm development of hubs within the country. Grant of additional points of call depends upon the terms of reciprocity and balance of benefits. At present there is no quid pro quo is available for Indian carriers for granting additional points of call to the designated carriers of UAE.
