Accordingly, a National Commission was constituted to examine the issue of Sub- categorisation of Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh. The Commission in its report, submitted on 01.05.2008,  had recommended amendment of Article 341 of the Constitution to provide for sub-categorisation and de-sub-categorisation of SCs. The Government has decided to seek views of the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations on the recommendation. So far 20 States and 2 Union Territories have responded. States of Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West Bengal and  Union Territory of GNCT of Delhi have opposed the move and States of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana and Punjab have supported the sub-categorisation of SCs. The Union Territory of Chandigarh has offered no comments in the matter.(c):  The opposing States are of the view that instead of sub-categorisation; proper mechanism should be devised to empower the poorest of the poor amongst the SCs through special schemes aimed at their social, educational and economic empowerment.(d): No, Sir.(e): No. Sir.  (f):  Does not arise.****
