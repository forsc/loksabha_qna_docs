                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):	There is no proposal under consideration with Ministry of Textiles to waive off the pending loans of the Handloom cooperatives and weavers of the country. However, the Government of India, Ministry of Textiles is providing loans at concessional interest rate of 6% for the handloom sector across the country under Concessional Credit/Weaver MUDRA Scheme, a component of National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP). Under the scheme, margin money assistance @20% of the loan amount subject to a maximum of Rs.10,000/- per weaver, interest subvention upto 7% and credit guarantee on loans for a period of three (3) years are given. MUDRA portal has been developed in association with Punjab National Bank to cut down delays in disbursement of financial assistance for margin money and interest subvention.***
