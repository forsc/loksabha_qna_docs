The Government has enacted Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act 2011 to amend the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA), 1994 and notified Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules 2014. The aforesaid Act and Rules have various provisions for increasing the pool of organ donors and to do away with legal complexities as well as non-uniform definitions. Government is implementing the National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP) for augmenting organ donation and transplantation in the country. A three level framework of networking organisations with NOTTO at National level, Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO) at regional level and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) at State level, has been set up for providing an efficient and organized system of organ and tissue procurement from deceased donors and their allocation to the waiting recipients. So far, NOTTO at New Delhi, 5 ROTTOs (at Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati) and 14 SOTTOs (in the State of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh) have been established.  As on date 595 centres (503 transplant centres and 50 retrieval centre and 42 tissue banks) are linked with the National Registry maintained by NOTTO.NOTP has various provisions which include:•	Financial assistance for setting up of State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (SOTTOs) in each State/UT.•	Financial assistance for setting up of Bio-material centres.•	Financial assistance for establishing new Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities and strengthening of existing Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities.•	Training to Manpower including surgeons, physicians, anesthetists, transplant coordinators, etc.•	Financial assistance for hiring of Transplant Coordinators to medical colleges and trauma centres.•	Financial assistance for maintenance of bodies of deceased donor.•	Financial assistance to Below Poverty Line (BPL) transplant recipients, who have undergone transplant in a Government Hospital, for post-transplant medications.A National Bio-material Centre has been set up at NOTTO, New Delhi and a Regional Bio-material centre has been established at ROTTO, Tamil Nadu. Further, funds have been released to the State of Bihar and Maharashtra for establishment of Bio-material Centre. Funds have also been released to the State of Bihar, Punjab for establishing new Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities and strengthening of existing Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities.Further, under Rastriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is being provided to poor patients who are suffering from life threatening diseases relating to heart, kidney, liver, etc. for their treatment including respective organ transplantation at Government hospitals/institutes having super specialties facilities. As far as creating awareness activities are concerned the NOTTO, ROTTOs and SOTTOs carry out awareness and disseminate relevant information about organ donation to the public.  A website www.notto.gov.in and a 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) have been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness are carried out from time to time. These include celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day every year, seminars, workshops, debates, display boards on organ donation awareness in the hospitals, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkad natak, etc. Social media is also being used to create awareness about organ donation among the citizens.
