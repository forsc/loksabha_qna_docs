                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c) Disinvestment is the subject matter of Department of Investment and Public AssetManagement (DIPAM) and DIPAM has informed that in February, 2021, the Governmenthas notified New Public Sector Enterprise (“PSE”) Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat. New PSEPolicy delineated 4 broad Strategic Sectors, which includes Petroleum Sector, based on thecriteria of national security, energy security, critical infrastructure, provision of financialservices and availability of important minerals. In Strategic sectors, bare minimum presenceof the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will beretained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in a strategic sector will beconsidered for privatisation or merger or subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure.NITI Aayog has been mandated to make recommendations with regard to the CPSEs underStrategic Sectors that are to be retained under the Government Control or to be consideredfor privatisation or merger or subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. Governmentwill consider the recommendations of NITI Aayog and decide on case to case basis.Privatisation will minimise the presence of Government in the PSEs and to make availablenewer investment opportunities for private sector, so as to allow infusion of private capital,technology, innovation and best management practices. This will also eliminate unnecessaryoverlap of PSEs within the same sector and improve economies of scale and reducewasteful administrative costs. Post disinvestment growth of PSEs may generate highereconomic activities resulting in new job opportunities and growth of the ancillary industries.The resources unlocked would be used to finance various social sector/ developmentalprogrammes of the Government, which shall benefit the public.****
