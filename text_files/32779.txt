ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Government of India (GoI) has formulated a Greenfield Airports (GFA) Policy, 2008 which provides guidelines, procedure and conditions for establishment of new Greenfield Airports in the country. As per the Policy, an airport developer or the respective State Government willing to establish an airport is required to send a proposal to the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) in the prescribed format available at www.civilaviation.gov.in. There is a 2-stage process for approval of the proposal i.e., ''Site Clearance'' followed by ''In-Principle'' approval. In accordance with this policy, MoCA receives proposals from the State Governments or Airport Developers from time to time for establishment of airports. After due examination, the approval for development of a new Greenfield Airport is granted. The responsibility for project implementation such as land acquisition, project funding, obtaining other mandatory clearances, etc. lies with the concerned airport developer or the State Government, as the case may be. Till date, no proposal as per GFA Policy, 2008 to construct an airport in Nalanda District, Bihar has been received in the Ministry.
