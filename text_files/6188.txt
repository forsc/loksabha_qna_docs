                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e):	The Government has introduced ‘Handloom Mark” to identify products woven on handlooms. Awareness creation activities are carried out from time to time to popularise these measures. Out of total 21328 registrations issued under ‘Handloom Mark’ Scheme, 668 registrations are in the State of Odisha. Further, 09 handloom products out of 65 handloom products registered under GI (Geographical Indications) Act are from the State of Odisha. Registered users of GI products have rights under the Act to approach the respective police authorities to safeguard their interests against illegal manufacturing / marketing of GI registered handloom products. Govt of India has been implementing Handloom Marketing Assistance, a component of National handloom Development Programme (NHDP) for popularising sale of handloom products from district to national level. State of Odisha has been sanctioned handloom marketing assistance of Rs 232.37 Lakh during the last three years for organising 17 National Handlooms Expos, Special Handlooms Expos and District Level Events which generated sale of Rs 25.07 Crore and benefitted 37000 handloom weavers. Besides, out of 1232 registrations issued under ‘India Handloom Brand’, 32 registrations are from Odisha. ‘India Handloom Brand’ products are of high quality and these authentic traditional designs have popularised indigenous patterns and fabrics of Odisha. The Government has been implementing the Handlooms (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985 for production of reserved items only on Handlooms. 11 textiles articles with some technical specifications are exclusively reserved for production on handlooms. Inspections are carried out in the field to enforce  the provisions of the Act. ******
