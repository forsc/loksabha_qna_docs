                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) to (c):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement in reply to Parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 338 for 21.12.2021 (a): The financial allocation under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) has been increased in the current financial year 2021-22 from previous financial year 2020-21 at Budget Estimate stage from Rs. 61,500 crore to Rs. 73,000 crore. Recently, additional fund of Rs.10,000 crore is allocated for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS as an interim measure. Further, allocation may be made upon assessment of demand during the Revised Estimate (RE) stage. (b): Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, wage payment is directly released into the accounts of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The electronic Fund Management System (eFMS) was introduced in 2011-12, while its successor National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) was launched in 2015-16. It now covers 2.69 lakh GPs of the country. Although NREGASoft was launched in 2006, its transaction based version is in operation since 2012-13 . Thus, these softwares have been in operation since long and their operations have stabilised. (c): No financial allocation is made to any State/UT (including Punjab) under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. The details of Central funds released to the State of Punjab under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in the last three financial years and current financial year 2021-22 is given below:Financial Year	         2018-19        2019-20	      2020-21	             2021-22                                                                  (as on 15.12.2021)Central Funds released (Rs.
