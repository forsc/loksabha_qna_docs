                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c) Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] was launched by the Government on 2nd October, 2014 with the main aim to make the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2nd October, 2019, by providing access to toilets to all the rural households. Under the programme, so far, more than 10.8 crore individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed across the country, as reported by the States/UTs on the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM (G).  All the villages in the country have declared themselves ODF as on 2nd October, 2019. Having achieved the outcomes of ODF, Phase II of SBM (G) is now being implemented with the focus to sustain the ODF status and to cover all villages in the country with Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) by 2024-25 i.e. to convert the villages from ODF to ODF Plus. The major components of SBM (G) Phase-II are: construction of IHHLs for any left out/newly emerging household, construction of Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs), development of facilities for biodegradable waste management, plastic waste management, greywater management, faecal sludge management, and Information, Education & Communication (IEC) activities. Under SBM (G), for disposal of human excreta, use of safe and eco-friendly onsite sanitation technologies such as twin leach pit toilets are encouraged for most parts of the country.  Under this technology, human faeces automatically becomes manure in 1-2 years and no sewerage system is required.(d) & (e) No specific funds have been earmarked under SBM (G) for advertising the scheme. However, under SBM (G) Phase-II, up to 5% of total programme funds can be spent on IEC.  State/UT-wise details of IEC expenditure under SBM (G) from 2014-15 to 2021-22, as reported by them on the IMIS, are given at Annexure.*****
