                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) As per Indian Council of Agricultural Research indigenous bovine breeds of India are robust and possess the genetic potential to play crucial role in the national economy. Looking towards the importance of indigenous bovine breeds in national economy Government of India has initiated Rashtriya Gokul Mission with the aim of development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines.  (b)  Total population of indigenous (indigenous breed and non descript cattle) cattle has declined by 6% between 19th Livestock Census and 20th Livestock Census. However, population of indigenous cattle breeds has increased between livestock census 2007 and 2019.  As per Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics (2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020) average productivity of indigenous cattle has increased by 14% from 2015-16 to 2019-20. ( c) and (d) Government of India has been implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission with focus on development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines thereby making milk production more remunerative to the farmers. Rashtriya Gokul Mission is leading to increase in population of high yielding animals of bovines including indigenous breeds of cattle and buffalo through following measures.(i)  Implementation of Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme using semen of high merit bulls including semen of high genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds. Under the component till date 2.37 crore animals have been covered, 2.87 crore artificial inseminations have been performed and 1.5 crore farmers benefited.  (ii) Implementation of progeny testing and pedigree selection for production of high genetic merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Hariana, Rathi breeds of cattle and Murrah, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri, Nili Ravi breeds of buffalo. So far 2332 high genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds have been produced and made available to semen stations for semen production. (iii) Implementation of IVF for faster genetic upgradation of bovine population including indigenous breeds of cattle and buffaloes.  Under the component projects have been sanctioned for establishment of 30 IVF laboratories out of this 17 laboratories have been made operational and work is in progress at 13 IVF labs. As on date 12438 viable embryos of indigenous breeds have been produced, 5864 embryos transferred, 951 calves born and 5976 embryos are under storage. (iv)       For implementation of genomic selection DNA chip has been developed for identification of high genetic merit bulls of indigenous bovine breeds at young age against 6- 7 years taken in traditional method to prove genetic merit of the bulls. National Dairy Development Board has developed Indus chip and buff chip for genomic selection of cattle and buffaloes including animals of indigenous breeds. ICAR -National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources has developed Low Density DNA chip  exclusively for genomic selection of animals of indigenous breeds. (v) Sex sorted semen production for indigenous breeds of cattle along with other bovine breeds has been initiated in the country.  Sex sorted semen is important for production of female calves with 90% accuracy.  As on date around 10 lakh sex sorted semen doses have been produced at Government semen stations and 18 lakh semen doses produced at semen stations with Mehsana Milk Union, BAIF and ABS Chitale. (vi)     Funds have been released to the States for establishment of 16 Gokul Grams for development and conservation of indigenous breeds of cattle and buffaloes in scientific and holistic manner out of which 14 Gokul Grams have been made functional and work is in progress at remaining 2 Gokul Grams.  Two National Kamdhenu Breeding Centres have been established as repository of germplasm of indigenous breeds.
