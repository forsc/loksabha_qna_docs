ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF FINANCE (a) to (e) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. †*410 to be answered on 22.07.2019 regarding Kisan Credit Cards by SHRI GIRIDHARI YADAV and SHRI ASHOK MAHADEORAO NETE:(a) & (b): The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was introduced in 1998 for issue of KCC to farmers. The eligible beneficiaries include all Farmers – Individuals / Joint borrowers who are owner cultivators; Tenant Farmers, Oral Lessees & Share Croppers; Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups of Farmers including tenant farmers, share croppers etc.  The scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system which enables farmers to meet the short term credit requirements for cultivation of crops; Post-harvest expenses; Produce marketing loan; Consumption requirements of farmer household; Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture; and Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities. The scheme is implemented by Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks and Cooperative Banks.The KCC Scheme has since been simplified and provides for issue of ATM enabled RuPay Debit Card, inter alia, with facilities of one-time documentation, built-in cost escalation in the limit, multiple delivery channels for drawal of the limit, any number of drawals within the limit, etc. The short term component of the KCC limit is in the nature of revolving cash credit facility.The credit limit/ loan amount under KCCs is fixed by Banks as per guidelines prescribed in the Master Circular dated July 4, 2018 issued by RBI. The short term credit limit under KCC for the first year is determined based on Scale of Finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical Committee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10% of limit towards post-harvest/household/ consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance and/or accident insurance including personal accidental insurance scheme (PAIS), health insurance & asset insurance. The limit for second and subsequent years (3rd, 4th and 5th year) is arrived  based on first year limit for crop cultivation purpose plus 10% of the limit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance and estimated term loan component for the tenure of KCC, i.e., five years. The short term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and is to be treated as the Kisan Credit Card limit.Under the KCC Scheme, a flexible limit of  `10,000 to `50,000 has been provided to marginal farmers (as Flexi KCC) based on the land holding and crops grown including post harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investments without relating it to the value of land.Farmers holding KCCs are eligible beneficiaries of the interest subvention scheme through which short term crop loans of upto `3 lakh are provided to farmers at an effective interest rate of 4% per annum. The benefits of KCC along with interest subvention have been extended to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers. In addition to availing the benefit of crop insurance scheme of the Central Government, the KCC holder has the option to avail the benefit of any type of asset insurance, accident insurance (including PAIS), health insurance (wherever product is available) and have premium paid through his/her KCC account. (c)	& (d): Data on specific nature of complaints, such as complaints regarding non issuing of KCC to eligible farmers, is not centrally maintained as reported by RBI and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). RBI has, however, informed that they have introduced Banking Ombudsman Scheme with an object of enabling resolution of complaints relating to services rendered by banks and to facilitate the satisfaction of settlement of such complaints. 22 offices of the Banking Ombudsman across the country receive complaints alleging deficiency in banking services under the ground of complaints prescribed in the Scheme. Complaints pertaining to ‘delay in sanction, disbursement or non-observance of prescribed time schedule for disposal of loan applications’ and ‘non-acceptance of application for loans without furnishing valid reasons to the applicant’ are covered under the said scheme.(e): State-wise details of number of operative KCCs are given at Annexure.*******
