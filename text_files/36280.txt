ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)to(c): Yes, Sir.  Steel produced using recycled material such as steel scrap emits substantially less emissions and hence it is highly desirable. The steel scrap generated inside the steel plants are fully recycled back in the process. The steel scrap generated from various end use & sources are to be collected, segregated and sized before it can be used by the steel producers. The following initiatives have been taken to enhance availability of steel scrap for the steel sector and promote recycling/ circular economy:-?	Ministry of Steel has notified a steel scrap recycling policy to ensure scientific processing of steel scrap from various sources so that higher quantities of steel scrap is available for the steel producers. ?	The Vehicle Scrappage Policy, has been launched by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, to promote replacement of end of life vehicles and boost demand for new vehicles. According to the policy, end of life vehicles will have to be mandatorily scrapped if they do not pass the fitness and emission tests. Under the policy, automated testing stations and scrapping facilities are to be set up in phases.?	CERO, a joint venture between Mahindra Accelo and MSTC Ltd. (a PSU under the Ministry of Steel) has set up two vehicle scrapping centres at Greater Noida and Pune. ?	Ministry of Steel is also funding research & development projects to increase consumption of steel in the country. Increase in consumption will generate more end of life steel as scrap and promote circular economy. ********
