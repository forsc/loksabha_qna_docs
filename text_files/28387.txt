ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode throughout the country, including State of Maharashtra. As on 15.11.2021, 50 PMKKs have been allocated covering all the 36 districts of State of Maharashtra. Out of allocated PMKKs, 43 PMKKs have been established covering 33 districts. The districts-wise details of established PMKKs for State of Maharashtra is given at Annexure.(b) and (c)	Under flagship scheme of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), there is no provision of setting up of hostels for training; however, there is a provision of boarding and lodging for 50% of the enrolled candidates in 8 North Eastern (NE) States, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand even if the candidates are being trained in their own districts. The provision of boarding and lodging is also available for Women, Persons with Disability (PwD) and Transgender candidates irrespective of the region when they move outside their native district for attaining the training. Further, under schemes titled “Skill Development in 47 Districts Affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE)” and “Enhancing Skill Development Infrastructure in NE States” of Directorate General of Training, MSDE, there is a provision of construction of hostels for youth in the ITIs.(d)	Under PMKVY, Short Term Training (STT) is linked to placement, while Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under the STT-PMKVY, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates. Also, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers.Further, based on the learning from implementation of PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16) and 2.0 (2016-20), the orientation of the scheme has been changed from supply driven to demand driven under PMKVY3.0.The demand driven and bottom up approach has been provisioned to boost demand for job roles  which are prevailing at regional/local level. In addition, informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy which aims to support the self-employment as well. This scheme also supports the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs.
