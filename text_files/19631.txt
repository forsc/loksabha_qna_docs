(d)	The total cost of the project is approximately Rs 5718 crore, with US$ 500 million (approximately Rs. 3700 crore) to be funded by the Central Government through World Bank and rest coming as State share from the participating States, over a period of 5 years. The fund sharing pattern would be 90:10 for Himachal Pradesh and 60:40 for the other States i.e. Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Odisha.
