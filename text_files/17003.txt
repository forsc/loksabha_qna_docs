ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a)  The 36th National Games allotted to Goa, which was scheduled from 20.10.2020 to 04.11.2020, had been postponed due to outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. (b) Central assistance of Rs.97.80 crore has been released to the Government of Goa for creation / development of sports infrastructure for 36th National Games.  (c) & (d) National Games, being biennial, are required to be conducted every two years. But there has been delays in timely conduct of National Games, which are attributable for reasons such as non-completion of stadia and sports infrastructure in scheduled time, announcement of elections of States and General Elections, weather conditions such as monsoon, unexpected outbreak of pandemic, etc.  (e) The first Khelo India University Games was successfully conducted at Odisha from 22nd February to 1st March, 2020 with total athlete participation of 3182 from 158 universities in 17 sports disciplines.  (f) Athletes and teams are well aware about the National Games through the State Governments, concerned National Sports Federations, Sports Promotion Boards, etc. Once the dates of National Games are finalised, Indian Olympic Association and the Organizing Committee of National Games use various publicity platforms such as print media, electronic media, social media to promote the National Games among spectators throughout the country.  ****
