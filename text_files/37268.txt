An application from M/s Apple India Limited was received in Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in April, 2015 seeking permission for import of used Apple I-Phone and I-pads which are sold as Apple Certified and Pre-owned after repair by the original equipment manufacturer. The matter was discussed in the Technical Review Committee in its 37th meeting held during June, 2015 which deliberated upon the proposal with respect to Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. The Committee so far has not recommended import of old consumer electronic items like mobile, lap-tops, televisions etc. for the purpose of trading.  The Committee noted that the items proposed to be imported are known to have short functional life and are prone to become obsolete in short period of time.  Therefore, generation of e-waste would become quicker in the country.  The Committee therefore, did not recommend import of such items for trading purpose.Import of electronic items in the country is subject to the permission / Registration / authorization under the following regulations wherever applicable:(i) Import Policy: ITC (HS), 2022, Schedule - I (Import Policy) and Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 notified by Ministry of Commerce & Industry.(ii) Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2021 notified by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.(iii) Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 (HWM Rule) and e-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 notified by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC).(iv) In addition, as indicated in Para 2.03 of Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-2020, Domestic Laws/Rules/Orders/Regulations/Technical Specifications/ Environmental/Safety and health norms applicable to domestically produced goods shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to imports,unless specifically exempted.(c)  and (d):  Government of India’s goal is to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub. In pursuance of this, we are  broadening and deepening our electronic manufacturing ecosystem under the aegis of AtmaNirbhar Bharat. Mobile Phones, IT hardware, Television sets are a few thrust areas wherein Government is promoting domestic manufacturing. The steps taken in this regard are placed at Annexure.
