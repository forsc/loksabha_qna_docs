                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (f) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******* STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.54 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON 04.02.2021 REGARDING TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE.*********(a) to (f) : 	Government of India approved schemes worth  Rs.2,02,266 crore under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGY); Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS); Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) (along with their subsumed components) to assist the State Governments to strengthen their transmission and distribution systems and ensure electricity  access to all households. Under the schemes, projects worth Rs. 2786 crore were sanctioned for Kerala based on the proposal received from the State Government.The Ministry of Power had received a letter dated 10.09.2020 from the Member of Parliament of Wayanad, Kerala, enclosing a copy of  a DPR of Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) for improving the transmission and distribution infrastructure in Kalpetta Circle, Wayand district in Kerala. The schemes of DDUGJY and IPDS were approved in the year 2014 and have a sunset date of 31st March,2022 and therefore it would not be possible to sanction new projects under these schemes. However, in the Union Budget of 2021-22, the Government of India have announced the launching of a revamped reforms-based and results-linked Distribution Sector scheme that will provide assistance to State Governments for further strengthening and upgradation of their transmission and distribution infrastructure. The State Government of Kerala can propose projects under the above scheme. Providing electricity connection to households is one of the benchmark/aspirational targets which is monitored under Aspirational District Programme and as per information available on NITI Aayog dashboard, the percentage of households with electricity connection in Wayanad district is 100%. ***********
