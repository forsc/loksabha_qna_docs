ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) to (d):	Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices and other market conditions. The OMCs have not only increased but also decreased the prices of petrol and diesel in line with changes in international prices and rupee dollar exchange rate.  The Average price of Indian Basket of Crude oil has risen approximately 313% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 ($19.90/bbl to $82.11/bbl).	The Central Government reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 per litre respectively effective from 4th November, 2021.  The measure was aimed to give a further fillip to the economy and to boost consumption and keep inflation low, thus helping the poor and middle classes. Many States/UTs have also reduced the VAT on petrol and diesel subsequently.(e):	The excise duty including cess levied by the Government form March, 2020 to November, 2021 is as follows:With Effect From	Excise duty including Cess 	Petrol14-03-20	22.9806-05-20	32.9802-02-21	32.9004-11-21	27.90 Diesel14-03-20	18.8306-05-20	31.8302-02-21	31.8004-11-21	21.80x-x-x-x-x
