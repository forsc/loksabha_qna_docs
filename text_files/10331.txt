ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) No, Sir. Cleanliness is a continuous process and every endeavour is made to keep the railway stations, rail yard and passenger trains in properly maintained and clean condition. Some of the major initiatives taken by Indian Railways towards improvement of cleanliness include integrated mechanised cleaning contracts for major stations including cleanliness of toilets, rag picking and garbage disposal contracts, increasing provision of dustbins, mechanised cleaning of coaches at terminals and onboard housekeeping service (OBHS) in important trains.  Third party audit cum survey on cleanliness of major stations and trains is also being carried out to get status check feedback and also to instil healthy competition for improvement. Indian Railways has proliferated bio-toilets on its coaching stock so that no human waste is discharged from coaches on to the track contributing to enhanced cleanliness. (b) Does not arise. (c) At present, there is no project / proposal for maintaining cleanliness in railways under Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. However, PPP model has been adopted in a few areas such as setting up mechanised laundries for washing of bedroll linen for AC coaches and operation and maintenance of Pay and Use toilets at stations.*****
