ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT  (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)  (a) to (d): The Government is in the process of formulating a New Education Policy. In this regard, a Committee for the Draft National Education Policy was constituted in June 2017 under the Chairmanship of Dr. K Kasturirangan, which submitted its report to the Ministry on 31st May 2019. The Draft NEP 2019 was uploaded on MHRD’s website at https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf and also at https://innovate.mygov.in/list-nep/ to elicit comments and suggestions from the various stakeholders. Further, letters were written to States/UTs Governments and Government of India Ministries inviting their views and comments on DNEP 2019.  An Education Dialogue with Hon’ble MPs of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Karnataka & Odisha on three consecutive days i.e on 31.07.2019, 01.08.2019 & 02.08.2019. Two meetings, one with State Education Secretaries of School Education and another with State Secretaries of Higher & Technical Education was held on 09.07.2019 and 08.08.2019 respectively. Around 2 lakh suggestions on the Draft National Education Policy have been received from various   stakeholders. A special meeting of CABE on National Education Policy was held on 21.09.2019, to discuss the National Education Policy. There has been wide publicity and positive feedback from all stakeholders. Accordingly, based on all feedback/comments received from various stakeholders on the Draft NEP, the Ministry is in the process of finalizing the National Education Policy, 2020. The guiding principles of National Education Policy 2020 are access, equity, quality, accountability and affordability. Draft National Education Policy 2019 has made recommendation regarding broadening the scope of accreditation to cover all Higher Educational Institutions. In keeping with the principle of affordability, it is also proposed the enhancement of philanthropic efforts may be encouraged to provide equitable access to quality education for all sections of the society.   *******
