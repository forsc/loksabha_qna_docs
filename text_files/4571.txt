                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at Annexure-I. Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. Based on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been completed and sent to concerned States.Various statutory clearances except Stage-II forest clearance & clearance from Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of Hon’ble Supreme Court have been accorded for components under KBLP Phase-I. The clearances for the projects proposed under KBLP Phase-II are in advanced stages. The comprehensive DPR of the KBLP has been completed and circulated to Governments of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Draft Memorandum of Agreement for implementation of KBLP has been sent to Governments of MP and UP for concurrence. Contd…P/2//2//The techno-economic clearance to the Damanganga-Pinjal link project has also been accorded subject to statutory clearances. The DPR of Par-Tapi-Narmada has been sent to Central Water Commission for appraisal. Draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for implementation of Damanaganga-Pinjal and Par-Tapi-Narmada link projects has also been sent to Governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat for concurrence. The Draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three projects viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet)-Krishna(Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) - Pennar(Somasila),  Pennar(Somasila)-Cauvery(Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States.(b)  The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained. The estimated time for implementation will depend upon the construction schedule as per DPR.(c)	  The interlinking of rivers (ILR) project envisages diversion of waters from surplus basins to deficit basins through inter basin water transfer links. The interlinking of rivers project will provide benefits to irrigation, domestic and industrial needs, hydropower apart from the incidental benefits of flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc.(d) & (e)	Some of the States have certain views/observations regarding ILR Projects and the link-wise details of views/observations raised by these State Governments are given at Annexure-II.***** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4224 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.07.2019 REGARDING “RIVER INTER-LINKING”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
