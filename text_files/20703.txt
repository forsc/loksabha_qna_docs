ANSWER




(a) Grant of approval under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a continuous process. All the proposals for approval for use of forest land for non-forestry use (roads, hydro and thermal power railways and coal mining) are processed as per the provision of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Rules, and Guidelines frame thereunder.  Proposals received from the States/UTs for various non-forestry purposes are examined by the Central Government for their completeness. Prompt decision is taken by the Central Government on the proposal which are complete in all respect.(b) & (c)During the last three years a total no. of 1618 proposals of the above categories have been received from the States/UTs. Out of which, a total no of 725 projects have been granted final approval under the FC Act, 1980. The States/UTs wise details of these proposals is annexed at Annexure-I.Similarly, the Ministry has received 133 applications for Environmental Clearance (EC) relating to construction of roads, hydro and thermal power projects and coal mining projects during April, 2018- 05th February, 2021. Out of which, 105 projects have been granted approval under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The State/UT-wise details of such projects granted are at Annexure-II.The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003 (FC Rules) and EIA Notification, 2006 lays down detailed process for application, appraisal and grant of forest clearance (FC) and environmental clearance (EC). The said notification also specifies time period for processing and grant of FC/ECs. In some of the cases the time period may be more because of litigations, directions of courts/ tribunals and additional project specific studies desired by the expert committees, etc.(d) & (e) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Changehad already delegated the powers to Regional Empowered Committees (RECs) constituted at each Integrated Regional Office to finally dispose of proposals involving diversion of upto40 hectares of forest land (except the proposals relating to mining, regularisation of encroachments and hydel projects) and all proposals involving diversion of forest land for linear projects irrespective of area of forest land involved.As per the provisions of EIA Notification 2006 , the powers have already been delegated to the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) to grant EC for the category B projects in the schedule of the Notification.***
