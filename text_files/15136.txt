Will the Minister of CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS be pleased to state:(a) whether the Government has issued some notices to pharmaceutical giants regarding non-compliance of the pricing norms, specially in Tripura and Delhi/NCR; (b) if so, the details thereof; (c) if not, the reasons therefor; and (d) the details and the name of said companies and the response of the Government on their replies, so far?






ANSWER




(a) to (d):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) monitors the prices of medicines on a regular basis to check overcharging by pharmaceutical companies. Whenever any company is found to be overcharging consumers for a medicine above the ceiling price notified by the NPPA, the NPPA issues a notice to such company to deposit the overcharged amount along with applicable interest under section 7A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.	The NPPA examines and considers the reply of the companies, if given, before issuing notices. The NPPA does not maintain state-wise record of overcharging by pharmaceutical companies. However, company wise detailed list of overcharging cases, where demand notices have been issued is available on the NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in.*******
