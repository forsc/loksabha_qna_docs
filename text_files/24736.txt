ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R. K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	Energy Efficiency Services Ltd. (EESL) is implementing  Market Integration and Transformation Programme for Energy Efficiency (MAITREE) in the areas of building energy efficiency and cooling. In cooling area, EESL is implementing the programs like Super-Efficient Air-Conditioners (SEACs) and Building Energy Efficiency Program (BEEP). EESL has undertaken following activities in the area of cooling:i.	Demand aggregation for Air Conditioners (ACs) as a part of implementation of SEAC Program (SEAC): EESL has deployed 19,500 SEACs in Government Buildings, Industries and domestic consumers. The details are as follows:-Description	Qty	Billing Amount (INR)Government Buildings	       17,000	 96.05 CrInstitutional/PSUs	         1,537	 4.36 CrRetail Buyers	            8,79	 2.63 CrPrivate Organizations	               84	 0.24 CrTOTAL	19,500	103.28 Crii.	Development of strategy for Environmentally Safe Appliance Disposal for Air-Conditioners (ACs) and other electronic waste coming out of retrofit.  iii.	Initiative for Healthy and Energy Efficient Buildings including technology identification, design specifications, and pilot project implementation: The ‘Retrofit of Air Conditioning to Improve air quality for Safety and Efficiency’ (RAISE) program was launched on 20th July 2020.  EESL has completed the procurement of technology through competitive bidding.  iv.	Market development for new technologies: Chiller Energy Efficiency Program including market assessment, feasibility study, business strategy, standard contracts, tools for chiller retrofit feasibility.(c) :  		The SEAC program of EESL has brought down the cost of the super-efficient AC by about 15-20% compared to the similar product in retail market. (d) & (e) :  	Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)has been awarding 5 Star labels to those Air Conditioners whose Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) is equal and above 4.5 (in case of Inverter Air Conditioners model). The Standards & Labelling Programme of BEE does not certify anything as SEACs since the programme is based on star labels, which means that these models are also registered as 5 star only. As per BEE estimation, the minimum savings from a 1.5 Tonnes rating 5 Star Inverter is around 850 units per year as against current level of 1 Star model of same category. It is reported that out of 88.48 lakhs ACs sold in 2019-20, about 19% were under 5 Star category.****************
