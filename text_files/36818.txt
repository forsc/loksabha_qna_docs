ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD)(a) and (b) 	In February, 2021, the New Public Sector Enterprise (“PSE’’) Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat'' was announced which lays down a broad roadmap for PSEs. The policy delineated four broad Strategic Sectors based on the criteria of national security, energy security, critical infrastructure, provision of financial services and availability of important minerals. In strategic sectors bare minimum presence of the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in a strategic sector will be considered for privatisation or merger/ subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. PSEs in non-strategic sectors shall be considered for privatisation, where feasible, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closure.	New PSE Policy intends to ensure optimize the growth, productivity, competitiveness and job creation potential of the enterprises. The resources unlocked can be used to finance various social sector/ developmental programmes of the Government in public interest.(c)	The details of operating PSEs as on 31.03.2021 along with their gross revenue from operation (during the FY), and paid up capital (as on 31st March of FY), for the financial years 2011-2012 to 2020-2021 are at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. (d)	The objective of the asset monetization is to monetize the brownfiled assets through structured contractual partnership with performance standards on service delivery and use the proceeds for enhanced capital expenditure for infrastructure creation and better operation and maintenance.
