The decision in the matter is taken keeping in view the evolving situation of COVID and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.

Till date five Variants of Concern have been classified by World Health Organization (WHO).  The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is the latest variant classified as Variant of Concern by the WHO.  The Omicron variant has been reported from 54 countries.  Total 23 cases of Omicron variant have been detected in India till 7th December 2021.
