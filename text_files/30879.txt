ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):  The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) has notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time, which deals with the process to grant Environmental Clearance (EC) including mining of minerals. Any likely impacts of the mining activity, including pollution of groundwater, air and noise pollution, are assessed during its EIA & Environmental Management Plan(EMP) studies, which is mandatory for obtaining EC for all significant mining activities.  The EC is granted to the project based on the appraisal of such project keeping in view of EIA/EMP studies and various conditions are stipulated therein to address and mitigate the environmental impacts.(c ) & (d) The concerns of local affected persons and others who have plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the project or activity are taken in to account during EIA/EMP process. In the above context, public consultation/public hearing is undertaken for all category A and B1 projects or activity mentioned in schedule of the EIA Notification, 2006 as amended time to time. If any mining activities involves relocation of some population residing within or very near to a proposed mining activity, then it is compensated under the land acquisition law. Accordingly, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Plan including compensation to be paid to the project affected families, is prepared and implemented by the project authorities.    After issuance of EC, half yearly compliance report is required to be submitted by the project authorities to the concerned Regional Offices of the MoEF & CC. Post-Project Clearance, Monitoring report is scrutinized to ensure that environmental norms as laid down in the EC are not violated and appropriate action is contemplated under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for non-compliance of environmental clearance conditions. In cases of major non-compliance, further follow up action is taken for effecting compliance including issue of show cause notice followed by directions under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 on case to case basis.***
