The said circulars do not lay down any conditions or criteria in respect of income of the individuals for availing of moratorium. Cess and taxes are levied by Government, through procedures laid down in this regard. Banks can however specify fees or charges for services rendered by them. In the case of extension of moratorium, as per inputs received from public sector banks, they have not levied any charges for the same. ***
