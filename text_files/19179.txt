ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (f): The Ministry of Civil Aviation receives requests for connecting various cities including Kishangarh in Rajasthan to various parts of the country from time to time. However, after repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs). Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDGs. However, the Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity. ;Further, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme on 21-10-2016 to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity and make air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. The implementing agency, Airports Authority of India (AAI), has identified Kishangarh airport to connect Ahmedabad, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Surat, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, Lucknow and Jodhpur under UDAN scheme. Currently, Kishangarh is connected to Delhi, Ahmedabad, Indore and Surat. The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. ;;;
