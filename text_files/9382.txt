ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a):	The quota for fresh scholarship under the Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for minorities is fixed at five lakh per annum. However, there is no such quota for renewal Scholarships and all eligible students who apply are awarded the renewal scholarship under the Scheme. In order to encourage students belonging to six notified minority communities i.e. Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian (Parsi) of poor economic background to avail scholarship under the Scheme, advertisements are published in leading newspapers all over the country by the Central Government as well as through the States in English/Hindi & other regional languages. In addition, the Ministry also organizes coordination meetings, workshops at national as well as regional levels and conducts video conferencing with the States and Union Territories to facilitate the implementation of Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for minority students. (b):	The RE (Revised Estimate) 2018-19 for Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme was ? 500 crore and the actual expenditure was ? 354.89 crore. However, disbursement of Scholarships under Post-Matric Scholarship scheme for the year 2018-19 continues in 2019-20 and 6,84,265 Scholarships have so far been sanctioned against the target of 5,00,000 scholarships under the Scheme for 2018-19.*****
