ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (2021) has included 239 faunal species which are known to occur in India as endangered species, among which there are 45 species of mammals, 23 species of birds, 18 species of reptiles, 39 species of amphibians and 114 species of fishes.(b)  The Centrally Sponsored Scheme ''Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats’ listed 22 species of animals as endangered of which there are atleast five (5) species with increasing trends in their population along with four (4) species with stable population. Apart from this, there is ''Recovery of Endangered Species'' programme which has been initiated in which, 16 species have been identified for recovery viz. Snow Leopard, Bustard (including   Floricans), Dolphin, Hangul,  Nilgiri Tahr,  Marine Turtles, Dugong,  Edible Nest Swiftlet, Asian Wild Buffalo, Nicobar Megapode, Manipur Brow-antlered Deer, Vultures, Malabar Civet, Indian Rhinoceros, Asiatic Lion, Swamp Deer and Jerdon’s Courser. Moreover, the locally extinct coral species of Acropora have beenrestored by transplanting at Gulf of Kachchh National Park brought from Gulf of Mannar. Further, MoEFCC, through the amendement in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 has included species like two Horseshoe Crabs (Tachypleus gigas and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda) and one species of Gecko (Gecko gecko) for saving them from endangerment.  (c) & (d) The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for punishment for violation of its provisions. The Act also provides for forfeiture of any equipment, vehicle or weapon that is used for committing wildlife offence(s). Protected Areas, viz., National Parks, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves covering important wildlife habitats have been created all over the country under the provisions of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats. Further, law enforcement authorities in the states maintain strict vigil against poaching of wild animals. Wildlife Crime Control Bureau has been set up to gather intelligence about poaching and unlawful trade in wild animals and animal articles and to achieve inter-state and trans-boundary coordination in enforcement of wildlife laws.  Apart from this, financial assistance is provided to the State/Union Territory Governments under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of ‘Development of Wildlife Habitats’, ‘Project Tiger’ and ‘Project Elephant’, for providing better protection to wildlife and improvement of habitat, which also includes awareness generation activities. For the protection of flora, as a part of its conservation and awareness programmes, BSI organises many outreach activities like Green Skill Development Programmes (GSDP), Herbarium Methodology Training Programmes, seminars/ symposia/ conferences/ webinars and various online/ offline competitions for school/ college students on the occasion of World Environment Day, International Biodiversity Day, Ozone Day, International Wetland Day etc. The different policies formulated by the government to save the endangered, vulnerable, and threatened species in the country include setting up of Botanic Gardens, Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Biosphere Reserves and protected areas in different phytogeographical regions of the country. Many of the wildlife species such as Rhododendrons, Alpine plants etc. have been conserved in Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary, Sikkim; Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Sikkim and in the National Orchidarium and Experimental Gardens of BSI, which are located in various phytogeographical regions.*****
