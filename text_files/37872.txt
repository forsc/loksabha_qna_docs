BAALU ‘PRIVATE SECTOR IN ADAPTATION TECHNOLOGIES’ DUE FOR REPLY ON 04.04.2022The Government has taken various initiatives as it seeks to encourage participation of private sector enterprises in India’s climate action. India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement in 2015 envision, inter-alia,to better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management.The National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC), the overarching policy framework for climate action, is guided by the principle of effective implementation of programmes through public private-partnership and unique linkages including with civil society and local government institutions. In line with NAPCC, 33 States and Union Territories have prepared their state specific action plans for climate change. Under these plans, some of the States and UnionTerritories have recognized, inter-alia, the importance of private sector engagement in climate action. The Union Budget 2022-23 has highlighted climate action as one of the priority areas along with inclusive development, energy transition and financing of investments, etc. In this context, the budget has provisioned a range of reforms and programmes in multiple sectors, including priority areas such as health, agriculture, manufacturing, and education. These include an increased allocation for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the domestic manufacturing of solarmodules; co-firing of 5-7% biomass pellets in thermal power plants;development of sustainable and innovative business models by the private sector for ‘Battery or Energy as a service, the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model for saving energy in large commercial buildings;sovereign green bonds to raise funds for environmentally andclimate-friendly infrastructure;the co-investment model for raising blended capital to finance startups for agriculture & rural enterprise relevant for farm produce value chain; rolling out an open platform for the National Digital Health Ecosystem for universal health access and ‘National Tele Mental Health Programme,’ etc.To meet the challenges of climate change, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has launched a flagship network project ‘National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture’ (NICRA). The project is being implemented through different components viz., strategic research on adaptation and mitigation, demonstration of technologies on farmers’ fields in 151 clusters of villages one each from climatically vulnerable districts and creating awareness among farmers and other stakeholders to minimize the climatic change impacts on agriculture. The project aims to develop and promote climate resilient technologies that help the districts and regions prone to extreme weather conditions like droughts, floods, frost, heat waves, etc., to cope with such extremes. Pradhan Mantri Fasal BimaYojana (PMFBY) is being implemented toprovide insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in theevent of failure of any of the notified crop as a result of natural calamities,pests & diseases.The Scheme is implemented through selectedinsurance companies under the overall guidance & control of the Ministry of Agriculture &Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW) and States/UTs in co-ordination with various other agencies. The Government is also implementing ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Syrakshevm Utthan Mahabhiyan’ (PM-KUSUM) to provide energy and water security, de-dieselise the farm sector and also to provide option of producing solar power. India has launched Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), which is a partnership of National governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and knowledge institutions that aims to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development. The Government supported Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) is facilitating exchange of innovative practices and technologies on resilience of infrastructure systems between the private sector and the public sector. This is being done through online platforms.  The Coalition is actively engaged with ARISE Network (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction(UNDRR) network of over 300 members), the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment (private sector led initiative with over 120 members), and InsuResilience Global Partnership among others.The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for FY 2019-25 is a first-of-its-kind, whole-of government exercise to provide world-class infrastructure to citizens and improving their quality of life. It aims to improve project preparation and attract investments into infrastructure by forging partnerships with the private sector through effective models for co-working between public and private sectors. The NIP provides opportunities in transport, logistics, energy, communication and social / commercial infrastructuresectors. Addressing climate issues is one of the major priorities of the Governmentand several steps have been taken in this direction. *****
