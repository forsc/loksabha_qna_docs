The DSCs have been entrusted with the development of District Skill Development Plans (DSDPs) to promote decentralized planning and implementation at the grassroots.  To build capacity of the DSCs and to help them manage skill development planning and program delivery, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) attaches Mahatma Gandhi National Fellows with the district administration. The Fellows are posted as part of their academic programme in premier management institutes, which has an in-built component of on-ground practical experience. So far, a total of 512 DSDPs have been received from 31 States/ Union Territories. The DSDPs identify sectors in which employment opportunities and demand for skilling exists. These activities are performed under the World Bank assisted programme Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) for strengthening of skilling institutions.  	Under the Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) scheme, the Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) engaged as the JSS go to the rural areas for outreach programmes for skill training.(c)	The Ministry has been implementing various schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and Craftsmen Training Scheme, for providing skill development training to the prospective youth of the country both in urban and rural areas.
