HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 496* FOR 26TH JULY, 2019(a)	to (e): Considering that the cartridges used in ENDS, besides containing liquid nicotine, are known to contain many other harmful chemical components such as flavourants and other carcinogens; and that there is still lack of scientific evidence to conclusively suggest that ENDS are less harmful; and keeping in view of the risks of initiation of ENDS especially by young population resulting in undermining of country’s tobacco control efforts, this Ministry issued an Advisory to States / UTs on 28th August, 2018 asking them to ensure that any Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) including e-cigarettes and the like devices that enable nicotine delivery are not sold (including online sale), manufactured, distributed, traded, imported and advertised in their jurisdictions, except for the purpose & in the manner and to the extent, as may be approved under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules made thereunder.Subsequently, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, the apex body of the Government of India with the mandates for formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research; conduct, coordination and implementation medical research for the benefit  of the Society and translating medical innovations in to products/processes and recommending their introduction into the public health system, has released “White Paper on Electronic Nicotine Delivery System” which recommends complete prohibition on ENDS or e-cigarettes in India in the greater interest of protecting public health, in accordance with the precautionary principle of protecting population from a noxious substance. The State Governments of Punjab, Karnataka, Mizoram, Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Meghalaya, Odisha and Nagaland have so far prohibited the Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS). Any sale of ENDS in such States/UTs is not permissible. Health being a State subject, the enforcement against illicit trade and black marketing of ENDS is the responsibility of the concerned State / UT Government.**
