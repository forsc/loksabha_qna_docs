ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :   Government of India had launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) in December, 2014 for augmentation and strengthening of rural sub-transmission and distribution works, feeder segregation and rural electrification works in the country.  As reported by the States, all the inhabited un-electrified villages as per Census 2011 stand electrified on 28th April, 2018 across the country under DDUGJY. Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – Saubhagya was launched in October, 2017 for electrification of rural and urban poor households in the country. All households have been reported to be electrified by the States on Saubhagya portal, except 18,734 households in Left Wing Extremists (LWE) affected areas of Chhattisgarh as on 31.03.2019. Subsequently, seven States reported 19.09 lakh un-electrified households identified before 31.03.2019 that were earlier unwilling but have now expressed willingness to get electricity connection which were also taken up for electrification.  Except for 1,855 households in Chhattisgarh and 25,429 households in Jharkhand located in LWE areas, all houses have been reported electrified as on 28.02.2021. As reported by the States, since launch of Saubhagya Scheme, 2.81 crore households have been electrified, up to 28.02.2021. The State-wise details of the same are furnished at Annexure-I.(c)  &  (d) :    Electricity is a concurrent subject and supply/distribution of electricity to all consumers of urban and rural areas falls primarily under the purview of the respective State Governments and/or State Power Utilities. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) to help them to achieve the objective of providing uninterrupted power supply to all households.All the States and the Union Territories (UTs) have signed MoUs with the Central Government to ensure 24x7 power supply w.e.f. 1st April 2019 onwards. Many States and UTs claim to supply 24x7 power other than the planned outages and interruptions due to unforeseen events.  Government of India has recently announced the launch of the Reforms Based Result Linked Revamped Distribution Scheme which would help in increasing operational efficiency and financial sustainability of the DISCOMs and help DISCOMs in achieving this goal.(e) :		As per National Power Portal (NPP), the average duration of power outages in Urban Areas (in 25 States) for the month of March, 2020 varies from 00.00 (MM:SS) to a maximum of 75:16 (MM:SS) per day. The State-wise details of the same are furnished at Annexure-II.Similarly, as per National Power Portal (NPP),  the average duration of power outages in Rural Areas (in 20 States) for the month of March, 2020  varies from 13:48 (MM:SS) to 609:00 (MM:SS) per day. The State-wise details of the same are furnished at Annexure-III.***********
