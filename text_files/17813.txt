ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):       The Ministry is implementing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,  2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), through States/UTs which guarantees upto 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work.As per the provisions mentioned in Schedule-II of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005 wage seekers are entitled to receive payment of compensation for the delay at the rate of 0.05% of the unpaid wages per day for the duration of delay beyond the sixteenth day of closure of muster roll. The delays take place mainly  in the    first-stage of wage payment due to inefficiency on the part of different State functionaries in uploading the FTOs. Delay compensation is being paid by the States/UTs whenever accrues.(b):      Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is demand driven wage employment programme. Fund release is a continuous process from which wage payment is made on regular basis.  Under DBT wage payment is made directly to the bank/post office account of the beneficiary by the central Government through the National Electronic Fund Management System after receiving the Fund transfer order (FTO) from State Government through PFMS. The Ministry has already released the funds Rs.61,293 crore to the State/UTs during the  current financial year.(c) to (e):  Yes, many persons  have returned to the rural areas during Covid pandemic period. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment scheme. Every adult member of a household in a rural area, having job card (as per Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act), is eligible for a demand for a job under the scheme.  There is no provision to register a Job card holder categorised as migrant labourers/ family in the job card in the scheme.  A job card can be issued to a migrant labour/family as per the provisions of the Act against a demand by the migrant labour/family. A total of 86,81,928 new job card during the current FY so far, has been issued as compared to 36,64,368 new job card issued during the same period of the FY 2019-20. The Ministry also does periodic revision of the “Agreed to Labour Budget” in consultation with States/UTs as per their demand and performance so as to provide work in time to every wage seeker on demand for work. The agreed to Labour Budget (persondays) and budget allocation during the last two years and current financial year 2020-21 (as on 17.09.2020) are given below:  	                                               2020-21	    2019-20	 2018-19Agreed to Labour Budget (persondays) (In crore)	        310.79	     276.76	  256.56Budget Allocation (Rs. in core)*	                61,500	    71706.55	  61830.09*The Government has made provision for additional provision of Rs. 40,000 crore under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA during the current financial year 2020-21 towards meeting any additional demand for work.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) has been launched on 20th June, 2020 to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for returnee migrant workers and similarly affected citizens in rural area, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. The Abhiyaan adopts a multipronged strategy of providing immediate employment & livelihood opportunities to the distressed, to saturate the villages with public infrastructure and creation of livelihood assets to boost the income generation activities and enhance long term livelihood opportunities by giving focus on 25 works in 116 selected districts across 6 States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  The duration of the Abhiyaan is 125 days commencing from 20th June, 2020 with a resource envelope of Rs. 50,000 crore. A total of about 29 Crore mandays employment have been provided under GKRA so far and a total expenditure of Rs. 26,382 Crore has been incurred under GKRA so far. (f):       The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on timely payment process for direct payment into the account of beneficiaries. States/ UTs have been advised to follow the aforesaid SOP. Use of platforms such as PFMS/NeFMS facilitate monitoring of payments on a real-time basis. Use of the aforesaid mechanisms have resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay orders leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current Financial Year 2020-21 (as on 17.09.2020), around 98.57 % pay orders have been generated within 15 days from the date of closure of the Muster Roll at National Level.*******
