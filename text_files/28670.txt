ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) and (b)  The natural rubber producers in Kerala are getting adequate price for their product vis-a vis expenditure.  Domestic Natural Rubber prices have increased in the country in the recent past and the monthly average price for the RSS4 grade natural rubber in Kerala during October 2021 was Rs. 171.14 per kg, against the tentative cost of production i.e. Rs 99.46 per kg,  including all paid out costs, interest on working capital and depreciation of fixed assets . As  domestic NR price is highly sensitive and  is linked to prevailing international prices of natural rubber , the Government has been taking steps from time to time to ensure that domestic farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. (c) Total area under rubber cultivation has not decreased during the last five years. In the state of Kerala, it has almost been static as given in the following table : 	Area under rubber in India (ha)	Area under rubber in Kerala (ha)2016-17	818,000	551,0502017-18	820,900	551,1152018-19	822,000	551,2002019-20	822,300	551,0302020-21	823,000	550,650Source: Rubber Board                                                                                  *****
