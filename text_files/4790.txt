                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducted study in 60 major cities of India. It has been estimated that around 4059 ton per day of plastic waste is generated from these cities. Extrapolating this, it is estimated that around 25,940 ton per day of plastic waste is generated in the country.The Government of India in order to regulate the manufacture and use of plastic carry bags and ensure the environmentally sound management of plastic waste in the country has notified the Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 in supersession of the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 on 18 March 2016. In order to reduce the generation of plastic waste in the country, the Government has issued directions to commissioners of 46 million-plus cities & 20 state capital cities and 118 towns located on bank of Ganga river relating to prohibit manufacturing & use of sub-standard (<50µ thickness) plastic carry bags (having handle or non-handle). The Government has also been promoting 100% bio-based, compostable carry bags, conforming IS/ISO 17088. In addition, 21 States/Union Territories in the country have notified more stringent norms and imposed ban on plastic carry bags and other items in their respective States/UTs. (c) According to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), the quantum of plastic waste imported under HS code 3915 during last three years (2016-17 to 2018-19) and current year 2019-20 (April,2019) is as follows: Period	Quantity in Metric Ton2016-17	155,7872017-18	181,6382018-19	218,7472019-20(April''19)	19,305		*Figures for the financial years 2018-19 & 2019-20 are provisional and are subject to change. (d) The Ministry has notified the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Amendment Rules, 2019 vide notification G.S.R.178(E) on 1 March 2019 as per which solid plastic waste (Basel No. 3010) has been prohibited from being imported into the country including in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and by Export Oriented Units (EOU). A window of six months, i.e. up to 31 August 2019 has been provided to the importers in SEZ and EOUs in order to provide them with time to honor their prior business commitments and make necessary arrangements to comply with the provisions of the amendment.  (e) The Hon’ble NGT in its order (OA No .851/2018) dated 30 April 2019 directed CPCB to take action for ensuring that its recommendation is fully implemented by all concerned in the matter of implementation of Plastic Waste Management Rules as well as restriction on import of plastic waste is implemented in such manner as may be directed by the CPCB.In compliance to the order CPCB has issued directions under Sec 18(1) (b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to all SPCBs/PCCs on dated 27.06.2019 to ensure that pulp & paper units which are importing waste paper containing plastic should manage plastic waste in accordance with the provisions of Plastic Waste Management Rules,2016.  (f)  The Ministry in supersession of earlier waste management rules has comprehensively revised 6 waste management rules including Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Rules prescribe that no waste generator shall throw, burn or bury the solid waste generated by him, on streets, open public spaces outside his premises or in the drain or water bodies. Further, the Rules direct the waste generators to segregate the waste at source and hand over the segregated waste to authorised waste pickers or waste collectors. The Rules mandate the Urban Local Bodies to frame Bye-Laws incorporating the provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and ensure timely implementation. Apart from framing the policy, the Central Government is also supporting the efforts of State Governments in establishing the infrastructure related proper implementation of solid waste management in their states. MoHUA is implementing the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) project under which various projects have been taken up. Under this programme during the mission period of 2014-15 to 2019-20, an allocation of Rs. 7424.24 Cr has been made for Solid Waste Management Projects.*****
