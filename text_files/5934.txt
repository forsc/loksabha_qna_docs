ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has however, laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines with a view to achieve better air transport services to different regions of the country. It is, therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability in the country subject to compliance with Route Dispersal Guidelines.;Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS-UDAN is market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces and airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS.;;Under RCS(Regional Connectivity Scheme)- UDAN(Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme, there is a provision of revival of existing unserved airports. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal for revival of existing un-served / under-served airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Public Sector Undertakings and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions.;;Amravati Airport figures in the list of unserved airport under RCS-UDAN. In the 3rd round of bidding under UDAN, AAI, Implementing Agency has issued Letter of Intent to M/s Airline Allied Services Limited for RCS routes between Amravati & Mumbai subject to suitability of airport. Further, no airline submitted bid for operation of RCS flight from Amravati to Delhi and Pune.
