ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have reported that there is a possibility of diversion of domestic LPG cylinders including PMUY cylinders by unscrupulous elements due to the tax differential between LPG for domestic use and commercial LPG. Complaints of diversion are investigated by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and if the complaint is established, action is taken as per provisions of Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG)/Distributorship Agreement.(b) to (e) OMCs have reported that a control mechanism has been put in place to prevent more than one cylinder booking in a single day. Further, while receiving application for new connection, Proof of Identity and proof of address are collected to ascertain the identity of customers. In case of PMUY consumers, de-duplication is carried out based on Aadhaar, Bank accounts, Name & Address, Abridged Household List Temporary Identification Number (AHL TIN) and Ration card.----------
