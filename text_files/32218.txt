ANSWER




                                                        (a)        Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) for skill development of youth across the country. Till now, under placement link Short Term Training (STT) component of PMKVY, 53.26 lakh and 23.59 lakh candidates have been certified and placed, respectively, in diverse sectors. Out of which, 39.76 lakh and 20.94 lakh candidates have been certified and placed, respectively, under PMKVY 2.0. An independent evaluation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes including PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) has been conducted by NITI Aayog. The report of NITI Aayog highlighted that very small proportion of candidates who were trained in a trade however got placed in a different trade. The report also highlighted that mismatch between industry requirement and candidate expectation is very low. (b)        Based on the evaluation studies and learning from the implementation of PMKVY 1.0 and 2.0, Ministry has launched the new and modified version of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) on 15.01.2021. Under the new version of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0, the informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy and it promotes candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs. Demand driven with bottom-up approach have been adopted under PMKVY3.0 so that trained people may get the jobs in similar trades in which they are being trained.
