The project has the target to pilot the incubation programmes with 250 women and the acceleration programmes with 100 women in the States of Rajasthan, Telangana, Assam, Manipur and Meghalaya.(ii) 	National Entrepreneurship Awards Scheme (NEAS) -To catalyze a cultural shift in the youth of the country for entrepreneurship, National Entrepreneurship Awards Scheme has been introduced in year 2016. The Scheme has the objective to recognize and honour young entrepreneurs and eco-system builders for their outstanding contribution in field of entrepreneurship development. Under the scheme, awards are given to those individuals and organisations who are working in the field of entrepreneurship development and there is special provision of 3 awards exclusively for Women Entrepreneurs. So far, out of a total of 95 awards conferred, 34 women entrepreneurs have received National Entrepreneurship Awards under the Enterprise sub track.2. 	Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is implementing Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector. Any individual above 18 years of age is eligible to avail benefits of the program. For setting up of projects costing above Rs.10 lakh in the manufacturing sector and above Rs. 5 lakh in the business /service sector, the beneficiaries should possess at least VIII standard pass educational qualification. General category beneficiaries can avail of margin money subsidy of 25 % of the project cost in rural areas and 15% in urban areas. For beneficiaries belonging to special categories such as women/ scheduled caste/scheduled tribe/OBC /minorities, ex-serviceman, physically handicapped, North Eastern Region(NER), Hill and Border areas etc. the margin money subsidy is 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas. The maximum cost of projects is Rs. 25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs. 10 lakh in the service sector. Benefit can be availed under PMEGP for setting up of new units only.Women are thus covered as special category under PMEGP and are entitled to higher rate of subsidy. The programme is performing well and is very much popular among the unemployed Women. As per the budgetary guidelines, Ministry of MSME is required to spend atleast 30% of the budget on women in its schemes. Under PMEGP, 35 to 40% of the total margin money subsidy is disbursed to women.3.
