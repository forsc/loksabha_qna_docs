                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c): Yes, Sir. The National Mental Health Survey was carried out in 2015-16 over 12States of India under the overall supervision of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare andimplementation done by National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences(NIMHANS), Bengaluru. In total 34802 adults and 1191 adolescents drawn from 12 stateswere interviewed. Prevalence of mental disorders in age group 13-17 years was found to be7.3% and nearly equal in both genders. Prevalence of mental disorders was nearly twice(13.5%) as much in urban metros as compared to rural (6.9%) areas.(d): Education is a subject in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of theschools are under the control of the respective State Governments. Under the Integratedscheme for School Education - Samagra Shiksha, effective from the year 2018-19, there is aprovision for supporting States and UTs on interventions related to Guidance and Counsellingin schools. Funds are proposed to be provided to the States/UTs, in the current financial year2019-20 in order to encourage teachers to function as the first level counsellors in schools.Also, State-specific projects are funded to address the issues of adolescent children.Various steps have been taken by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)to make the teaching process student friendly which are as under:-<pre>? Guidelines have been issued to transact curriculum in a student centric manner withpromotion of active learning through focus on reflections and creating andconstructing knowledge. Teachers have been advised to follow inclusive principlesand not label children as ‘slow learners’ or ‘bright students’, or ‘problem children’.? CBSE has introduced Experiential Learning from 2019-20 session onwards.Accordingly, the schools plan the curricular activities in such a way which enablestudents to connect the content of their learning areas and subjects with their ownlives and the world around them.? The learning outcomes developed by NCERT help the teachers to direct theirteaching-learning in the desired manner and make other stakeholders responsible andalert towards their role for ensuring quality education.? In order to promote life skills and value education, CBSE has integrated Health andPhysical education with academics. Every school provides for one period per day forsports which leads to better stress management for children and also creates a betterenvironment for learning.</pre>In line with the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, NCERT has developedtextbooks that cover the aspects of stress, anxiety and other related problems in schools. ThePsychology textbook of class XI addresses peace concerns in its chapter on ‘Motivation andEmotions’. The concerns for health and well-being have been taken up in the Psychologytextbook of class XII in chapter 3 on ‘Meeting Life Challenges’, which tries to equip thestudent with aspects and causes of stress and the development of positive health. NCERTthrough its Adolescence Education Programme tries to inculcate life skills in thestudents who are at this crucial stage of their lives.NCF, 2005 advocates facilitating healthy growth and development of students acrossall school stages and scope for guidance/counselling at each of these school stages fromelementary through secondary and higher secondary stages. NCF has also articulated theconcern to provide guidance and counselling in schools to deal with stress related problemsand to guide students, parents and teachers to lessen the students’ stress. It particularlyemphasises the need to provide guidance and counselling by trained professionals to createthe support system for meeting academic and social pressures.*****
