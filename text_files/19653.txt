ANSWER




                                                         (a) As per The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA in Short), State Governments are responsible for implementation of various provisions of the Act. As per information received from State Governments, 1544 claims have been filed under FRA since 1st March, 2020 till 31st August, 2020.(b) As per information received from State Governments, 3152 claims have been rejected under FRA since 1st March, 2020 till 31st August, 2020.(c) & (d) This Ministry has not received report of any such rejection  being made by using satellite maps. The satellite imagery are envisaged to be only supplementary information to the other evidence to be produced by the Claimants as per Rule 13 of the rules under the FRA, 2006.   This is clearly manifest from Explanation 2 under Rule 12A (11) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Rule, 2007 (FR Rules) which provides that the satellite imagery and other uses of technology may supplement other form for evidence and shall not be treated as a replacement.         Further, in exercise of power under Section 11 read with Section 12 of the Act, this Ministry issued Guidelines on implementation of the Act on 12.7.2012 to the State Governments/UTs. The guidelines provide that use of any technology, such as satellite imagery, should be used to supplement evidences tendered by a claimant for consideration of the claim and not to replace other evidences submitted by him in support of his claims.      Subsequently, this Ministry also issued communication to States/UTs, who as per FRA, 2006 are responsible for implementation of the Act, on 28.04.2015 and 27.07.2015 reiterating the same position as also stressing the need for ground verification of claims using GPS/Android phone etc. to identify genuine claimants.        Also as per rule 6(b) of FR Rules, district administration in general and the SDLC in particular are expected to assist the Gram Sabhas and the FRCs by providing forest and revenue maps to them. In this context Geo-referenced maps may be generated and be provided to Gram Sabhas.*****
