ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)  To promote Inland Water Transport in the country, 111 waterways have been declared as National Waterways (NWs) under the National Waterways Act, 2016 which came into effect from 12th April, 2016.   The list of 111 National Waterways is at Annex.-1.  Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of NWs, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has concluded that 23 NWs have been found viable for cargo movement.   Out of these, developmental activities have been taken up in 13 NWs.    The list of the 23 NWs viable for cargo movement is at Annex-2.(c)    Feasibility Study of NW-53 (Kalyan-Thane-Mumbai waterway, Vasai Creek and Ulhas river - 145 km) has been completed in September, 2016.   As per Feasibility Study Report, 10 bridges out of 28 bridges across Kalyan-Thane-Mumbai waterway via Ulhas river (111 km), 5 bridges across Waldhuni Creek (3 km) and 2 bridges out of 7 bridges across Vasai Creek (31 km) are having in-adequate Vertical Clearance of 3 to 4 meters & Horizontal clearances of 8 to 20 meters which makes the waterway unviable for development of navigation for cargo transportation as the vessels may not pass through these bridges.          For development of passenger water transport on National Waterway No. 53 (Kalyan-Thane-Vasai), Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) has decided to construct jetties and allied facilities at 04 locations viz. (i) Mira Bhayander (ii) Kolshet (iii) Kalher (iv) Dombivali in the first phase.
