ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) & (b):  Yes, Government has issued an advisory on 02.04.2019 for non-AYUSH researchers/ scientists, institutions and editors of medical/scientific journals to involve appropriate Expert/Institution/Research Council of AYUSH in conducting any scientific study/clinical trial/research intervention to explore AYUSH drug or treatment and for vetting of the publication of the outcomes and findings of such studies to prevent incorrect, arbitrary and ambiguous statements and conclusions about AYUSH. The advisory is not intended for barring research studies and their publications by non-AYUSH researchers/scientists but for promoting the involvement of AYUSH research experts/institutions in such studies and publications.   (c) to (e):  	AYUSH systems are officially recognised integral part of the country''s healthcare delivery network and are promoted and mainstreamed through various policies, strategies and schemes of Government of India including the National Health Policy-2017, National Health Mission and National AYUSH Mission. Principles, concepts and approaches of AYUSH systems and their drug-based interventions are not comparable to the prevalent modern medical system. For scientific development of AYUSH systems, Central Government has inter alia established five Research Councils (viz. Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences; Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine; Central Council for Research in Sidhha; Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy; and Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy), published Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines for conduct of clinical trials in Ayurvedic, Sidhha and Unani medicine and implemented Extramural Research Scheme to support projects of scientific exploration of AYUSH.  Details of these initiatives are available in the Ministry''s website www.ayush.gov.in and accordingly it was not intended or presumed to hurt the ‘Make in India’ initiative or deter inter-disciplinary research in AYUSH or curb academic freedom of the researchers/scientists. The objective of the advisory was not to jeopardize the potential and scope of AYUSH in public healthcare and not to distract or dissuade the people from resorting to AYUSH from arbitrary statements and unfounded conclusions from the scientific studies and research publications related to AYUSH.
