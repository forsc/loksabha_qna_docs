State-wise status of coverage with FHTCs is in public domain, which is available on JJM dashboard at:https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspxFollowing the principle of bottom-up approach, under JJM, every village has to prepare a ‘Village Action Plan’ (VAP), which will form the basis for ‘District Action Plan’ and it will be subsequently aggregated at State level as ‘State Action Plan’. For long-term sustainability of water supply system, the VAPs to be implemented in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, 15thFinance Commission tied grants to rural local bodies/ PRIs for water & sanitation, MP & MLA’s Local Area Development Fund, District Mineral Development Fund, CSR fund, etc.Further, to bring in sense of ownership and pride among rural communities, community contribution is to be made, which is 5% of capital cost towards in-village water supply infrastructure in hilly, forested, and in villages having more than 50% SC/ ST population and 10% in the remaining villages.Communities will be rewarded by providing 10% of the in-village infrastructure cost of the scheme after successful implementation of the scheme, as a revolving fund to meet any unforeseen expenditure due to break down, etc. for long-term sustainability of the schemes.Further, priority is being given to water quality-affected habitations, Japanese Encephalitis/ Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (JE/AES) affected districts, Aspirational districts, drought prone & desert areas, SC/ST majority and Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) villages. *****
