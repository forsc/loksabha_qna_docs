                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b):	 Yes Sir. Substantial amount of food grains are retained by the farmers for their domestic consumption as informed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).  However, no specific studies have been conducted to ascertain the percentage of foodgrains retained in rural sectors with farmers. The ICAR institutes impart trainings/demonstrations to farmers, entrepreneurs and self-help groups under various schemes and programmes like “mera gaon mera gaurav” and conduct exhibitions, field level demonstrations, melas etc.	During last three years the Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering & Technology(ICAR-CIPHET) has conducted 28 Famers trainings (benefiting 865 participants) and 33 EDPs (benefiting 290 agripreneurs) on different aspects of post-harvest technology and value addition. Farmers scientist interfaces, agribusiness workshops, exhibitions on post harvest technologies were organized. Around 2000 farmers were benefitted for post harvest handling/storage/processing of food grains. Numerous technologies, machines and tools have also been developed to reduce post harvest losses. 	Further, the Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (ICAR-CIAE) is doing a project entitled “Development of mechanical grain handling system with grain spreading, collection, cleaning and bagging” to avoid the losses due to spillage, cross contamination, adverse environment with considerable saving in time and labour. The system will also be equipped with in-situ grain surface disinfestation to kill/ deactivate the insect, insect eggs, fungi, moulds etc. coming from field itself and protect the grain during storage. 	The institute also conducts training/demonstrations for farmers to make them aware about existing grain cleaning/processing machineries, storage techniques etc.(c) & (d):	 The Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA), has implemented the Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) system in the country. Warehouses intending to issue NWRs against deposited goods are required to obtain registration with WDRA after fulfilling prescribed norms. WDRA further implemented electronic-NWR (eNWR) since 26.9.2017 migrating to an IT platform for creation and management of electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (eNWRs) issued by the warehouses registered with it. The eNWR is issued by registered warehouses in the name of depositor (including farmers) for their goods deposited by them, mentioning details of the goods in terms of quality and quantity. The eNWRs can be used for obtaining pledge finance as well as for trading. The farmers can keep their Agricultural products in WDRA registered warehouse and take pledge loans against the e-NWRs issued to them from Banks / Financial Institutions, thereby avoiding distress sale. WDRA also conducts Farmers Awareness Programmes to spread awareness  about the importance of proper warehousing and  eNWRs. 	Further, Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) is available to farmers availing short term agri loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh at an interest rate of 7% per annum for one year.  Additional 3% subvention is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans; the same gets reduced to 4% per annum. The short term agri loan is also available to Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries from February 2019. The benefits of ISS can also be availed by farmers in allied activities like Animal Husbandry and Fisheries and who already possess KCC within the overall limit of Rs.3.00 lakh. New KCC can be issued to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers with provision of benefit of Interest subvention (IS) & Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) for loan amount upto Rs.2.00 lakh per annum. IS  of @ 2 % is available to Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs) having Kisan Credit Card (KCC) on post harvest loans against Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) i.e. at the same rates as applicable to crop loans for a period of up to six months post harvest.*****
