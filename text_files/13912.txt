MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry, carries out assessment of the country’s forest cover biennially and publishes its findings in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per ISFR 2019, the recorded forest area of West Bengal is 11,879 square kilometer (km2). There has been no decline in the recorded forest area of the State compared to the previous assessment reported in ISFR 2017. However, the forest cover in the State has increased by 54.51 km2 compared to the previous assessment.  (c) & (d) In the last five years, a total of 22 proposals have been received by the Ministry from Government of West Bengal for approval to use forest land for non-forestry purposeunder the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Final approval has been given by the Ministry in six (6) cases and in-principle approval in twelve (12) cases. Remaining four (4) cases have been returned to the Government of West Bengal for providing complete information. At present, no proposal from West Bengal is pending in the Ministry for approval. Details are given in Annexure. In cases of approval of use of forest land for non-forestry purpose, compensatory levies are deposited in the Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds. A total sum of Rs. 42.20 Crore was released by Adhoc CAMPA to the State of West Bengal during the last three years (2016-17 to 2018-19).
