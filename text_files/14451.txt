MINISTRY OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a), (b) & (c):	 The Ministry of Minority Affairs has implemented Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) earlier known as Multi-Sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) in 1300 identified Minority Concentration Areas (MCAs) across the country.   The MCAs are identified on the basis of concentration of minority population and backwardness of the area as compared to National average.  Projects related to creation of infrastructure in the field of education, health and skill development are accorded priority under the scheme by earmarking 80% resources for these sectors.     Further, 33-40% of resources are also earmarked for creation of facilities for girls/women.  	PMJVK being an area development programme, the entire population including the population of minority communities residing in the Minority Concentration Area are regarded as beneficiary of the projects.   At present, 249 Minority Concentration Areas of Uttar Pradesh including 11 MCAs of Bareilly District are covered under the Karyakram.   Details of the scheme are available on the website of the Ministry – www.minorityaffairs.gov.in   The type and number of units approved since inception in the State of Uttar Pradesh are as under:-S.
