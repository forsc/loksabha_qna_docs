ANSWER




                                                        (a)       To promote Inland Water Transport (IWT) in the country, 111 waterways (including 5 existing and 106 new) were declared as National Waterways (NWs) under the National Waterways Act, 2016.       Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) prepared for NWs, action plan has been formulated for 25 NWs which have been found viable for cargo/ passenger movement.  The list of the 25 NWs is at Annex-1.   Development activities have been initiated in the first 13 NWs out of the 25 viable NWs.   In addition, there is a Central Sector Scheme (CSS) for development of inland water transport infrastructure in the North Eastern States under which 100% financial assistance is provided to North Eastern States. (b) & (c)  The stretch of Kollam to Kottapuram of West Coast Canal and Champakara canal & Udyogamandal Canals (205 km) in Kerala was declared as National Waterway (NW-3) in 1993.   It has been further extended by 165 km in the North from Kottapuram to Kozhikode in April, 2016 by the National Waterways Act, 2016.    Development of waterways for the stretch of Kollam to Kottapuram of West Coast Canal and Champakara canal & Udyogamandal Canals has been completed except for 1.20 km between Edappallikotta & Kollam and is being maintained with a channel of 2 m Least Available Depth and 32/ 38 m bottam width.    NW-3 is operational with 24 hours navigational facilities, 9 permanent intermodal terminals with storage facilities and mechanized equipment for loading/ unloading of cargo.    Further, the construction/ modification of existing navigational lock at Thrikunnapuzha in NW-3 at a cost of Rs. 38 core has been entrusted to Irrigation Department, Govt. of Kerala.  Development of two more National Waterways viz. NW-8 (Alappuzha – Chenganaserry) and NW-9 (Alappuzha-Kottayam-Athirampuzha) has been taken up to have enhanced hinterland connectivity through waterways with Kochi Port.             There is no declared National Waterways (NWs) in Lakshadweep and therefore no scheme to enhance the logistical capability of the same has been taken up by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).
