                                                        (a) and (b): As per Manufacturers Association for Information Technology (MAIT), the manufacturing capacity of personal computers in the country is underutilized to the extent of about 80% on account of cheaper imports and certain disabilities which render domestic personal computer manufacturing uncompetitive on account of lack of level playing field vis-à-vis competing nations. These include lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and logistics; high cost of finance; inadequate components manufacturing base and limited focus on R&D by the industry. As a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA-1) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), India has implemented zero import duty regime on 217 tariff lines, including personal computers. (c), (d) and (e): The Government has notified the National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) on 25.02.2019, with the vision to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) and create an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally. NPE 2019 is available at the following link: https://meity.gov.in/esdm/policies. The mission of NPE 2019 inter-alia includes the following:•	Promote domestic manufacturing in the entire value-chain of Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM), including core components and materials to increase the domestic value addition and reduce dependence on import of electronic goods by focusing on skill, technology, scale and the global market.•	Promote ease of manufacturing by introducing new/ innovative fiscal incentives and augmenting the existing ones for the ESDM industry to make electronics manufacturing in India globally competitive.Further, the Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) for mobile phones, including smart phones, and related subassemblies/ components manufacturing has been implemented with the objective of progressively increasing the domestic value addition for establishment of a robust cellular mobile phone manufacturing ecosystem in the country. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and mobile phone manufacturing has emerged as a flagship sector in the electronics manufacturing space. In 2018-19, the production of cellular mobile phones reached approximately INR 1,70,000 crore, compared to INR 18,900 crore in 2014-15. The production of mobile phones in volume terms reached 29 crore units in 2018-19, as compared to production of 6 crore units in 2014-15. The steps taken by the Government for promotion of domestic electronics manufacturing industry and exports from the country, including infrastructure facility for electronics sector, are annexed.*******AnnexureSteps taken by the Government for promotion of domestic electronics manufacturing industry and exports from the country(i)	Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) provides financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector.

Under the scheme, approval has been accorded for setting up of 20 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) in 15 States across the country. (iii)	Tariff Structure has been rationalized to promote domestic manufacturing of electronic goods, including, inter-alia, Cellular mobile handsets, Televisions, Electronic components, Set Top Boxes for TV, Personal Computers, LED products and Medical electronics equipment. To promote domestic value addition in mobile handsets and their parts/ components manufacturing, a Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country during the past four years. The manufacturing of mobile handsets and their parts/ components has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (SKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition.  (iv)	As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI upto 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing, subject to applicable laws/ regulations; security and other conditionalities.(v)	For promotion of exports in the sector, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme are available under the Foreign Trade Policy, 2015-20. MEIS offers export incentives so as to offset disabilities of manufacturing. Zero duty EPCG scheme allows import of capital goods at zero customs duty, subject to specified export obligation.    (vi)	The import of used plant and machinery having a residual life of at least 5 years for use by the electronics manufacturing industry has been simplified through the amendment of Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, vide Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Notification dated 11.06.2018.
