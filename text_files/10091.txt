                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Yes, Sir.  Impact analysis of climate change on agriculture in Bihar was undertaken in 7 districts of Bihar viz., Supaul, Buxar, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Nawada, Banka and Saran (the adjacent district of Gopalganj), taking one village in each of these districts by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), under National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project. No such studies, however, were undertaken in Gopalganj.(c) & (d):	Yes, Sir.  The Government under Integrated Nutrient Management component of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is promoting soil test based judicious use of fertilizers through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, biofertilizers etc.).  Further, Government of India has also launched the schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) under NMSA to promote organic farming and restore long term soil fertility. In addition, split application and placement of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers, nitrification inhibitors including neem coated urea, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also recommended.  Further, in order to improve soil health and fertility, the Government has launched a National Mission on Soil Health Card to provide soil test based fertilizer recommendations to all the farmers. Besides, the ICAR also imparts training, organizes front-line demonstrations etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.*******
