ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Responsibility for safety of dams, including its operation and maintenance, rests primarily with dam owners, which are mostly the State Governments and Central/State Public Sector Units. Details regarding dam safety assessment, maintenance, repair and renovations are available with the concerned dam owners.  Further, generally dam owners themselves carry out the safety audit (in terms of periodical pre-monsoon and post-monsoon inspection) of their dams. Some States have also constituted the Dam Safety Review Panel for comprehensive inspection of their dams. Under the World Bank funded Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) Phase-I programme implemented during April 2012 to March 2021, 223 existing large dams located in 7 States have been comprehensively audited and rehabilitated at a cost of Rs. 2,567 crore. Further, as part of preparatory activities for DRIP Phase-II & III, comprehensive safety inspections of 351 large dams have been conducted by the Dam Safety Review Panels. State-wise details in this regard are placed at Annexure-I. In addition, as per National Register of Large Dams 2019 compiled by the Central Water Commission under this Ministry, there are 227 numbers of operational large dams in the country which are more than 100 years old (i.e., constructed in or before 1921).  State-wise list of these 100 years old dams is placed at Annexure-II. (c) & (d) Water being a State subject, construction, operation and maintenance of water resources projects including check dams is primarily States’ responsibility. The information related to number of check dams, their functionality and their upkeep etc. lies with the respective State Governments. ***ANNEXURE – IANNEXURE AS REFERRED TO IN PART (a) & (b) OF REPLY OF LOK SABHA USQ NO. 3602 FOR ANSWER ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “STUDY ON DAM SAFETY” State-wise details of Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) Inspections of Dams carried out in Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Projects (DRIP) I and II & III SI.No.	 State / Agency	No. of DSRP inspections		Under DRIP I	Under DRIP II & III1.
