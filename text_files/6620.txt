ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a): This Ministry is implementing two separate scholarship schemes for SCs and OBC students, namely Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Caste students (PMS-SC) and Post Matric Scholarship for Other Backward Class(PMS-OBC) students. The objective of these schemes is to provide financial assistance to eligible SC and OBC students for their study at post matriculation or post-secondary stage.(b) & (c): Under the PMS-SC Scheme, Central Assistance is released towards such portion of the total demand under the scheme of the States/UTs for a particular year that is over and above their annual committed liability. There is no State-wise fund allocation. The details of Central Assistance released State-wise under PMS-SC during last three years and current year are attached as Annexure I. PMS-OBC Scheme is a fund limited scheme under which the available budget is allocated State-wise and considered for release based on the proposals received from the States/UTs. The details of funds allocated and Central Assistance released State-wise under PMS-OBC Scheme during the last three years and current year are attached as Annexure II.(d): Under the Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for Scheduled Caste students (PMS-SC), all eligible students are entitled for full tuition fees and maintenance allowance. In order to encourage more students to avail scholarships under the scheme, the process of application and disbursement has been streamlined and most of the State Governments/UT Administrations have developed online portal for inviting applications and disbursements through DBT mode.******
