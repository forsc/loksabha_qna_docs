                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a to f): The exact number of people suffering from Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) in the country is not known. However, as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study – India: Health of the Nation’s States – contribution of cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases to Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) has increased from 0.9% in 1990 to 1.6% in 2016. Risk of developing NAFLD is influenced by several environmental and metabolic factors including physical inactivity, junk foods & high calorie foods, obesity, type 2 diabetes etc.Public Health and Hospitals is a state subject. Central Government however supplements efforts of States/UTs towards improving healthcare. Healthcare services for various diseases including liver diseases, are provided through public health facilities at different level. Treatment in Government health facilities is either free or subsidised. Further, under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) financial assistance upto Rs. 15 lakh is provided for treatment of Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients, suffering from life threatening diseases, in Government hospitals. This includes financial assistance for ailments associated with liver diseases, specified in the scheme guideline.The Government is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion, early diagnosis, management and referral. Under the programme, Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Clinics are being set up at District and Community Health Center (CHC) levels. Focus of the programme is on common NCDs which inter alia includes diabetes, which is one of the main reasons for NAFLD. Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs and for promotion of healthy lifestyle are also carried out through print, electronic and social media. Health promotion and prevention of risk factors for common NCDs in terms of healthy lifestyle and healthy eating is also one of the major activities of the programme.
