ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out all Single-use plastic by 2022. In this perspective, to create mass awareness among the common public, plastic industry, recycling units and other stakeholders, a three-phase campaign of “Swachhta Hi Sewa” was launched by Hon''ble Prime Minister from 11th Sep, 2019, which ended on Diwali i.e. 27th October 2019. This campaign inter-alia focused on awareness, advocacy, collection and safe disposal of littered plastic. Under the campaign, all stakeholders i.e. general public, students, industry, governments and local bodies came together and collected waste plastic from houses, streets, public places like parks, beaches, markets, religious and tourist places etc. Urban Local Bodies, Gram Panchayats, Government organisations and others made arrangements to deposit the collected plastic waste at designated locations for recycling. Start-ups, technical bodies and corporates came forward with their plans to recycle the collected waste. Eventual goal of the campaign was that the plastic waste is not dumped on land or into water but is recycled in environmentally sound manner. The campaign has achieved its near-term goal of creating awareness on the menace of plastic pollution. It is estimated that around 25,940 T/day of plastic waste is generated in India. Approximately 15,384 T/day, which is 60% of the total plastic waste generated in the country, is collected and recycled. Under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry, about one lakh schools have been identified as Eco-clubs, wherein, nearly thirty lakh students are actively participating in various environment protection and conservation activities, including Plastic Waste Management and other issues related to the environment management;In order to plan sustainable tourism and healthy coastal managementa beach cleaning drive campaign called “I#AM#SAVING#MY#BEACH” (Intensive Beach Cleaning & Environment Education Activity)was initiated to clean 50 beaches from 11th Nov to 17th Nov, 2019.(c)	The Ministry issued “Standard Guidelines on Single Use Plastic” on January 2019, with suggested different set of actions for State/UT Government to minimize the usage of single use plastics. These Guidelines were issued to the Chief Secretaries and the Principal Secretaries of all States/UTs for wide implementation in respective offices and States.An attempt has been made in the guidelines to target those kinds of Single Use Plastic for which alternatives are readily available. Such as jute bags, cloth bags, paper bags are available as an alternative to plastic carry bags. Similarly, sufficient alternatives available for the plastic cutlery like paper plates and leaf plates, paper/earthen cups and glass, wooden spoons, paper straws, multi-layered (aluminium + paper) pouches in place of container and container lids, wooden trays, stirrers made of wood. Apart from the traditional material, the new material like bagasse-based products, banana stem-based products are widely available in market.(d) to (e) An expert group has been constituted by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET) for research and development related to Oxo-Biodegradable Technology on plastic as an alternate plastic material. The CPCB is also working on the information available on the subject of bio-degradable/compostable plastics including Oxo-Biodegradable plastic or any other alternatives. *****
