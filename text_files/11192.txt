                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (f): Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched with the objective to incentivise employers for creation of employment. Under the scheme, Government paid Employer’s contribution i.e. 12% towards Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Pension Scheme (EPS) both (or as admissible from time to time) for a period of three years in respect of new employees registered with EPFO. The scheme is targeted for employees earning upto Rs. 15,000 per month. This scheme has a dual benefit, where, on the one hand, the employer is incentivised for increasing the employment base of workers in the establishment, and on the other hand, these workers will have access to social security benefits of the organized sector. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary through establishment under PMRPY was 31st March, 2019.  The details of the total funds allocated and utilized under PMRPY Scheme throughout India during last three years and the current year is as follows:-Year	Funds Released to EPFO(Rs. in crores)	Amount disbursed by EPFO (Rs. in crores)2016-17	167.69	2.582017-18	470.25	491.962018-19	3493.88	3870.882019-20As on Jan., 2020 (upto 27.01.2020)	3400.00	2996.18The details of the number of employees registered under PMRPY scheme for last three years and the current year across the country including Tamil Nadu is enclosed as Annexure-I, II & III. No employee was registered through establishments after terminal date of 31.03.2019. One case of was reported by Udupi Office of EPFO wherein an establishment had registered under EPF&MP Act, 1952 by providing false details.  Consequently, establishment code number has been de-activated and EPFO has filed FIR against the employer in this regard. Further, the members of the establishment have also been marked as deactivated.*****
