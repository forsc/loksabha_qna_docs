ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a) and (b): As per input given by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, on the basis of filings made by the companies up to 20.10.2018 in the MCA 21 registry, the details of CSR funds spent by the companies, including banks incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, for the financial years 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 are at Annex I.As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inputs, Public Sector Banks (PSBs) are not covered by the Companies Act and hence the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy related policies of the Companies Act are not applicable to these banks. RBI has issued guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development and Non-Financial Reporting – Role of Banks. These guidelines do not mandate CSR as a percentage of profits after tax.  (c) and (d):  As per instructions issued by RBI in respect of PSBs and the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 in respect of companies, audit of expenditure incurred under CSR forms part of the statutory audit of the PSB/company, which is carried out by auditors appointed by the PSB/company concerned.With regard to district-wise amount spent out of CSR funds in the State of Madhya Pradesh, it is stated that CSR spending includes expenditure on activities that are not attributable to specific locations (e.g., Swachh Bharat Kosh and National Sports Development Fund).*****
