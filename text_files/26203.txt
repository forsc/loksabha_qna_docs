This application works on a hub and spoke model to provide telemedicine services for citizen to doctor and doctor to doctor consultation. This application has also been integrated with 3.74 lakh Common Service Centers (CSCs) thereby facilitating access to equitable health care in the remotest areas of the country.To ensure that only valid health professionals are able to provide services under eSanjeevani, the telemedicine practitioners are first vetted by the State Nodal Officer for eSanjeevani before being onboarded
