                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (d): The Reserve Bank of India has informed that, as per its instructions, banks are required to have their own Board-approved loan policy, which guides the providing of loans and advances by them. It has further informed that it has deregulated the interest rate on advances sanctioned by banks and, accordingly, banks themselves determine their interest rates with the approval of their respective Boards of directors, subject to its regulatory guidelines in this regard. As such, Government does not determine the age for a borrower to get a loan and it also does not fix the interest rates on loans.*****
