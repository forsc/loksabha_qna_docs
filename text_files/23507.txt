The UDID cards State/UT-wise generated are placed at Annexure-V.(d) & (e)  The Central Government has enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 which came into force on 19.04.2017. Section 8 of the said Act guarantees equal protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters. The Act inter-alia provides for not less than 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities (i.e. disability of 40% or more) in Government employment, accessibility in built-up infrastructure, transportation and ICT ecosystem, priority in treatment and access to healthcare services for persons with disabilities. These measures were also applicable during the COVID-19 lockdown. Further, in order to implement the provision of reservation in Government employment envisaged under the RPwD Act, 2016, the Ministry notified the list of 3566 posts suitable for various categories of persons with benchmark disabilities on 04.01.2021.Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a guidance note on 14.04.2020 to all States/UTs for addressing health concerns of all citizens including persons with disabilities and enabling them to avail uninterrupted emergency health care services. On 24.04.2020, all the States/UTs were requested by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment to ensure basic accessibility features in the centres for COVID-19 testing & quarantine facilities as well as for treatment at hospitals & health centres. The Ministry of Rural Development released Rs. 80 crore to the States/UTs under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY) for payment of ex-gratia of Rs. 1000/- in two instalments (Rs. 500 each) to 8 lakh existing beneficiaries of Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS).During COVID-19 pandemic, the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) enhanced unemployment benefit from 25% to 50% of average daily earning and relaxed the eligibility conditions for insured persons including persons with disabilities under Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana for the period 24.03.2020 to 31.12.2020.On 26.03.2020, the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment issued ‘Comprehensive Disability Inclusive Guidelines for protection and safety of persons with disabilities (Divyangjan) during COVID 19 to all States/UTs. These guidelines provide measures to be adopted by various States/District authorities to give focused attention to protection and safety of persons with disabilities during COVID 19. These measures, inter-alia, include access to essential food, water, and medicines for PwDs; priority in treatment specially in respect of children and women with disabilities, on-line counselling mechanism, 24X7 Helpline Number at State level exclusively for Divyangjan with facilities of sign language interpretation and video calling, availability of information relating to services and precautions during COVID 19 in accessible format; and  issuance of passes to caregivers of persons with disabilities during lockdown on priority. These guidelines mandate the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities and the District officer dealing with empowerment of Persons with Disabilities to act as the State Nodal authority and the District Nodal authority respectively, to resolve disability specific issues of Persons with Disabilities. This Ministry also set up a dedicated 24x7 toll free Mental Health Rehabilitation helpline service ‘KIRAN’(18005990019) on 7th September, 2020 to address mental health concerns of persons with disabilities during COVID-19.Further, relief to persons with disabilities is a State subject by virtue of Entry 9 of the State list of the Constitution of India and accordingly, it is the responsibility of the State Governments to frame schemes and programmes to help PwDs live a productive and independent life.
