ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)  (a) to (d) A Statement is laid down on the Table of the House.  Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *352 for 17th July, 2019.  (a) and (b): The objective of the MPLAD scheme is to enable Members of Parliament to recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs to be taken up in their Constituencies.  All community assets of durable nature are already permitted.  Right from inception of the scheme, durable assets of national priorities viz. drinking water, primary education, public health, sanitation and roads etc. have been added as per aspirations and needs of the local communities.  A sector-wise illustrative list of works permitted under MPLADS is Annexed at Annexure-I. In addition, certain special items of works and works of nondurable nature are also permitted under the ''Guidelines on MPLADS'', such as for welfare of differently abled persons, Purchase of Computers, Ambulances/Herse Vans, Books for Schools, Colleges and Public Libraries, New Borings in place of Hand Pumps, Railway Halt Station, Shelters for imparting training for skill development etc.(c) and (d): The Ministry undertook third party physical monitoring of the MPLADS works in selected districts through independent agencies viz.  NABARD Consultancy Services Private Limited (NABCONS) and Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) Limited. Programme Evaluation Organisation (PEO) of erstwhile Planning Commission had also conducted an evaluation of the Scheme. NABCONs had reported that the MPLAD scheme is a unique scheme having the characteristic feature of de-centralized development founded on the wide scale application of the principles of participatory development  and has resulted in the creation of fairly good quality assets towards economic and social infrastructure, which has had an overall positive impact on the local economy, social fabric.   AFC in  its report concluded that about 82% works were in the Rural Areas and 18% works were in the Urban/ Semi Urban areas. The share of rural and urban area in aggregate cost was 78% and 22% respectively. It was also reported that the scheme has created various durable community assets which have impacted the social, cultural and economic life of the local community in one way or the other. PEO in its report inter alia mentioned that “The impact of the scheme as felt by the knowledgeable persons and local people indicate that about 65% of the created assets have been rated as good and overwhelming majority of them have opined that the created assets are as per the felt needs and has improved their quality of life.”                                              *****
