Under PMGKAY, Govt of India has made allocation of foodgrains @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for around 80 crore beneficiaries of all the 36 States/UTs covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA)  (Antyodaya Anna Yojana(AAY) & Priority Households(PHH)) including those covered under Direct Benefit Transfer(DBT) for a period of 8 months i.e April-November, 2020 and again similarly during the period May -November, 2021. .......2/--2-During the year, 2020, about 322 Lakh Metric Tons (LMT) of food-grains and during the year 2021, about 278 LMT foodgrains have been allocated free of cost under PMGKAY scheme to approximately 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries.  State/UT-wise details of foodgrains allocated, lifted and distributed  under PMGKAY during the year 2020 and 2021 are at Annexure-I(iⅈ).In addition  to foodgrains, during the year 2020, under PMGKAY- pulses have also been provided @ 1kg per household per month for 8 months i.e April to November, 2020 free of cost to all beneficiaries under NFSA covering 19.4 crore households. During the period April-June, 2020 an adjusted allocation of about 5.65 LMT pulses have been made in comparison to 5.82 LMT pulses allotted originally for 3 months and during the period July-November, 2020 an adjusted allocation of about 8.82 LMT whole chana have been made in comparison to 9.38 LMT of whole chana allotted originally for 5 months.

There is no upper limit for allocation of foodgrain to such organisations from any FCI depot.
