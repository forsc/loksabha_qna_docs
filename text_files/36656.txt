ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b)         The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Centrally Sponsored Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) compliant scheme. The scheme is implemented transparently and efficiently through a web-based Management Information System (MIS) Software, viz. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS). The maternity benefits under the scheme are directly transferred to the bank/ post office account of the beneficiaries from the Escrow bank account maintained at State/ Union Territory level in a transparent manner. There have been demands from some quarters to universalize PMMVY. Mission Shakti has been launched recently to provide integrated benefits of safety, security and empowerment to women. Under the revamped PMMVY under Mission Shakti, written consent and the aadhaar of husband is not a mandatory criteria, and this change will make the scheme more inclusive for single and abandoned mothers.  Furthermore, the maternity benefit amounting to Rs.6,000/- is also to be provided for the second child, but only if the second child is a girl child, to discourage pre-birth sex selection and to promote the girl child. (c) & (d)     Samarthya is an integrated sub-scheme under Mission Shakti for empowerment of women which includes Ujjawala, Swadhar Greh, Working Women Hostel, National Creche Scheme for Children of Working Mothers and PMMVY. Specific allocation is made for each component of Samarthya. Sufficient budgetary provision has been made under Samarthya for implementation of PMMVY.*****
