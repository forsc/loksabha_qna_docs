So far, Source apportionment studies have been completed in 37Non-Attainment Cities (NACs) and initiated in 51 NACs.  Major sources of Particulate Matter (PM) are road dust, industries, transport, and biomass burning.  As per recent study of TERI-ARAI, in PM2.5 concentrations, the average share of the transport sector varies from 17-28% in Delhi;industries contribute to 22-30%, while fuel (mainly biomass) burning (in residences and agricultural fields) contributes to 14-15% whereas Dust (soil, road, and construction) has a share of 17-38%. Whereas, in PM10 concentration, the average share of transport sector is 15-24% in Delhi;industries contribute to 22-27%; while fuel (mainly biomass) burning (in residences and agricultural fields) contributes to 13-15% whereas Dust(soil, road, and construction) has a share in PM10 concentrations (25-42%).(c)	& (d) Government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national level strategy to reduce air pollution levels across the country. Several steps are undertaken in the NCAP which interalia include the following:City Specific Clean Air Micro Action Plans have been prepared and rolled out for implementation in 132 non-attainment and million-plus cities. These action plans focus on city specific short/ medium/ long term actions to control air pollution from sources such as vehicular emission, road dust, burning of biomass/ crop/ garbage/ Municipal Solid Waste, landfills, construction activities, industrial emission, etc.Under NCAP, Centre level Steering Committee, Monitoring Committee and Implementation Committee has been constituted and periodic review of the implementation progress is conducted.
