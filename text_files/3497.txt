To promote and encourage early case reporting:(i) Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaigns (SLACs) have been introduced in all villages of the country to make people aware about the disease and the need for early reporting (ii)  ASHA Based Surveillance for Leprosy Suspects (ABSULS) has been introduced wherein ASHAs in villages identify leprosy suspects and refer them to the health facility for final diagnosis.III. Prevention of leprosy/ Interrupt transmission: Post Exposure Prophylaxis administration to contacts of new leprosy cases detected has been introduced to contain further transmission of disease in the community.IV.
