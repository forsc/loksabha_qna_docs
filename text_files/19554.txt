ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Sir,   a new draft Science, Technology & Innovation Policy (STIP) has been formulated and is presently at consultation stage.(b)       The draft policy is aimed at being bottom up, decentralized, inclusive, evidence-driven and knowledge-supported. The draft STIP envisions the aspirations of a new, future-ready India by ensuring active participation, shared responsibility and equitable ownership of all stakeholders; transforming the national STI landscape maintaining the delicate balance between fortifying India’s indigenous capacity and nurturing meaningful global inter-connectedness. (c)        The draft STI policy outlines efforts for increased contribution of private sector in the Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) through expansion of the STI (Science, Technology and innovation) financing landscape, incentivization for STI investments, STI collaborative funding model, governance of STI financing landscape, building a robust innovation ecosystem, and many others. (d)      The draft STI policy inter-alia contemplates setting up of an institutional mechanism to facilitate a corpus fund for investing in direct long-term investments in select strategic areas on various long and medium-term projects, commercial ventures, start-ups, technology diffusion and licensing to address identified priority areas in the STI ecosystem. (e)       The draft STI policy is aimed to be all persuasive and all-inclusive in strengthening the research in basic as well as translational areas and also encouraging the researchers in view of the importance of patents. (f)        The Government has been giving high priority to the field of research and initiated several steps for investing more funds. These resulted into gradual increase in India’s Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) over the years.  GERD increased by nearly 2 times during last 6 years.
