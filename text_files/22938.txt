                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to  (d) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), along with other Ministries in Government of India, is implementing schemes for combating climate change, imparting environment education as well as for imparting skills to youth for gainful employment, including in ‘green sectors’ such as environment, forestry and wildlife.  National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising of eight Missions, provides an overarching policy framework for combating climate change in the country. To support the objectives of NAPCC, 33 States and Union Territories including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) for State specific actions. Sectors like agriculture, forest and biodiversity, water resources, energy, urban development and transportation have been prioritized by the States/UTs.Under NAPCC, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to climate change by means of plantation activities in forest and non-forest areas. Started in 2015-16, a sum of Rs. 455.73 crores have been released to fourteen States and one Union Territory for undertaking afforestation activities over an area of 1,67,151 hectares. India has also committed to achieve land degradation neutrality and restoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Financial assistance to States/UTs is provided under various centrally sponsored schemes for afforestation, such as National Afforestation Programme, as well as through the Compensatory Afforestation Fund. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is also implementing the National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) since 2014. The XV Finance Commission has assigned 10% weight to forest and ecology in its horizontal devolution criteria and weights. These schemes help in preserving forests and biodiversity, and in conservation of environment and natural resources.They also provide employment opportunities to forest dependent and forest fringe communities and improve the forest resource base which in turn supports and improves the livelihood of these communities. Under GIM, there is a provision of 17% of the budget for livelihood improvement activities for forest dependent and forest fringe communities. Under the ongoing Environmental Information System (ENVIS) Scheme of the MoEF&CC, an initiative on ‘Green Skill Development Programme’ (GSDP) was launched in June 2017 on a pilot basis, at 10 locations spread over 9 bio-geographic regions of the country, to skill youth in environment, forest and wildlife sectors and enabling them to be gainfully employed or self-employed. Further, MoEF&CC is also implementing the Environment Education, Awareness and Training (EEAT) scheme with the objective to promote conservation and environmental awareness among students. It is implemented through Ecoclubs, National Nature Camping Programme (NNCP) and Capacity Building Activities (CBA). Further, the Ministry has launched the Green Good Deed (GGDs) movement in January 2018 as a social movement with the aim to bring about mass environmental awareness in the society at all levels.Under the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change, a project titled ‘Ecosystem services based adaptation to climate change in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh’ is being implemented with a grant of Rs. 19.81 cr. covering four forest divisions viz., Banda, Hamirpur, Orai (Jalaun) and Chitrakoot. The project aims to restore degraded forest areas with involvement of local communities and improve community/grazing land, grassland and adjoining lands through agroforestry. Households in the project areas are being supported for informed decision making in light of vulnerability to climate change. In Uttarakhand as well, a project under Adaptation Fund (of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) titled ‘Climate smart actions and strategies in north western Himalayan region for sustainable livelihoods of agriculture-dependent hill communities’ is being implemented with a grant of Rs 5.82 cr. The project supports climate smart interventions in sustainable livelihood management by means of spring rejuvenation, roof top rainwater harvesting, introduction of Drip Irrigation for increased water use efficiency and introduction of improved horticulture varieties and high value vegetable cultivation under protected conditions using bamboo-based poly houses etc. The communities in the project areas were provided training and exposure visits for understanding vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change.*****
