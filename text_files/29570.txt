                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) notifies industry specific discharge standards under ScheduleI ‘Standards for Emission or Discharge of Environmental Pollutants from various Industries’ of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees in the States and Union Territories, respectively are mandated to ensure the compliance of these standards. Industry specific environmental standards in respect of 81 industrial sectors have been notified so far.  The list of industrial sectors for which environmental standards are notified is given at AnnexureI. (b) There are 506 highly polluting 17categories of industries in Maharashtra. Of which, 474 units are operational and 32 are self-closed. Out of 474 operational units, 434 units are complying with the prescribed environmental standards and 40 units were found non-complying. Show-cause notices to 29 units and closure directions to 11 units are issued.The details of industries violating air pollution standards in the State of Maharashtra and the details of the complaints received against them with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) during last three years is at Annexure II. However, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has received 58 complaints regarding industrial air emission from NGOs, Associations and other sources from 1 November, 2020 to 30 November 2021. Out of which 30 complaints have been resolved and 28 complaints are under investigation. The details of 58 complaints regarding industrial emission from various areas of the State are annexed at Annexure III.(c) & (e)Four cement plants are located in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh namely, M/s Ultra Tech Cements, M/s Penna Cement Industries Limited, Boyareddypalli, M/s Sagar Cements (R) Limited and M/s Penna Cement Industries Limited, Talaricheruvu in Tadipatri (M). However, no complaint has been received by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board regarding air pollution from the cement industries during the last one year. Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board is closely monitoring the cement industries and ensuring operation of air pollution control system to protect the environment in the area. Environment Clearances are being accorded to cement plants subject to stipulation of environmental safeguards as per the provisions of EIA Notification 2006. The compliance to the stipulated EC conditions is monitored by 19 Regional Offices of the Ministry across the country by periodic monitoring. Steps taken for controlling the pollution by industries are as follow:i.The MoEF&CC notifies industry specific discharge standards under ScheduleI ‘Standards for Emission or Discharge of Environmental Pollutants from various Industries’ of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in States and Union Territories respectively are adhered to ensure the compliance of these standards. ii.The SPCBs/PCCs issue consent to establish/ consent to operate and authorization to the industries in the States/Union Territories. The SPCBs/PCCs also monitor the compliance of industrial emissions/effluent discharges and other operational activities according to the prescribed standards. iii.For strengthening monitoring mechanism and effective compliance through self-regulatory mechanism, CPCB has directed all 17 categories of highly polluting industries, Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) of Ganga basin, Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs), biomedical waste management facilities and common hazardous waste facilities to install Online Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) for constant vigil on pollution levels.iv.CPCB carries out inspection of 17 categories of highly polluting industries based on the computer generated SMS alerts, due to violation of effluent and emission standards, recorded in OCEMS. Industries are selected for inspection on the basis of SMS generated/off line from the online monitoring systems, installed in these industries. In case of non-compliance, action against industry is taken under provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.v.CPCB has formulated the criteria for categorization of industries and directed all SPCBs/PCCs in the year 2016, to adopt the same. The categorization is based on pollution potential of the industrial sector and the purpose of the categorization is to ensure that the industry is established in a manner consistent with the environmental objectives and to prompt industrial sectors to adopt cleaner technologies, ultimately resulting in generation of no or minimum pollutants. CPCB has categorized 254 industrial sectors into red (61), orange (90), green (65) and white (38) categories. ***
