                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) & (b): Introduction of new design variants of passenger coaches is a continuous process over Indian Railways (IR). In order to improve COVID-19 safety, few coaches with following additional features have been turned out on trial:(i)	Hands free foot operated taps and liquid soap dispensers inside and outside washbasins of the lavatories of the coach.(ii)	Provision of copper coating as anti microbial agent on handles having frequent passenger interface.(iii)	Covid precaution stickers pasted at prominent locations inside the coach.(c): No specific software is available for crowd controlling. Initially, during the COVID-19 pandemic, only a limited number of seats were being allotted to passengers through Passenger Reservation System (PRS) software. However, with the proliferation of Covid appropriate behavior, all the berths are being allotted as per PRS software to prospective passengers.(d): To contain COVID-19 pandemic, IR had discontinued all passenger carrying trains with effect from 23.03.2020. In view of the prevailing situation, only special trains, with limited stoppages, keeping in view the suggestions and concerns of State Governments and health advisories issued by them, are being operated*****
