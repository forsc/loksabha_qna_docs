ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)  	According to certain reports in the media, digital application was used soliciting the services of domestic workers for Kuwait. The Country’s laws are against human trafficking. The concerned authority of the Government of Kuwait responded promptly to the media reports and took necessary action against such application as well as similar other websites. Mission is also in touch with the Kuwait authorities to protect Indian workers from use of such applications in Kuwait. No case of any Indian victim through such means has come to the knowledge of the Mission. The Government has put in place the following measures to safeguard and regulate emigration of Indian women workers for overseas employment in Gulf countries:(i)	All women emigrants (Except Nurses) emigrating on ECR passports to ECR countries irrespective of nature/category of employment must be above the age of 30 years.(ii)	If the foreign employer wants to recruit Indian female workers having ECR passports through Indian Recruiting Agents for overseas employment in 18 ECR countries, they can only do so by engaging any of the state run Recruiting Agencies.   	At present there are nine such agencies namely NORKA Roots and Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultants (ODEPC) of Kerala, Overseas Manpower Corporation Ltd. (OMCL) of Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) of Uttar Pradesh, Overseas Manpower Company Andhra Pradesh Limited (OMCAP) of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana Overseas Manpower Company Limited (TOMCOM) of Telangana, 	Karnataka State Unorganised Workers Social Security Board (KUWSSB) , Karnataka and Karnataka Vocational Training & Skill Development Corporation (KVTSDC),  Karnataka. (iii)	The Foreign Employer is required to deposit a Bank Guarantee equivalent to US $2500 for recruiting each woman worker in the respective Indian Mission, in case of direct recruitment.(iv)	Embassy attestation has been made mandatory in respect of direct recruitment of all ECR passport holder women workers in respect of all ECR countries;(v)	Labour and Manpower Cooperation MoUs/Agreements are in place with the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that provide the institutional framework to comprehensively discuss and review labour related issues.  In accordance with the Labour and Manpower Cooperation/Agreement, Joint Working Group (JWG) meetings are held on regular basis to discuss various labour related issues, including the working conditions of Indian domestic workers in these countries.(b) & (c) 	There is no mechanism at present to prepare a comprehensive database of women working as domestic servants in Gulf Countries because a number of such category workers are holders of Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) passport and hence not required to take either clearance or register before departure from India. In addition, female domestic workers are going to Gulf Countries with tourist visa/ family visit visa and subsequently take employment there. In such cases also they do not need to take clearance or register. The eMigrate system captures data for female domestic workers who are holders of Emigration Check Required (ECR) passports travelling to Gulf Countries for overseas employment after obtaining Emigration Clearances (EC). Number of EC granted to such workers during the year 2015-2019(31.10.2019) for six Gulf Countries are as under.<pre>S.
