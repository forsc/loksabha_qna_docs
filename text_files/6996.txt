The details of the flight operations in the States of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura and Tezpur in Assam are as follows:Mizoram : Aizawl airport in Mizoram is a served airport.

Meghalaya : Implementing Agency has awarded RCS route between Shillong & Kolkata and Shillong & Guwahati River Front (Water Aerodrome).Tripura :  Kailashahar, Kamalpur & Khowai are available in list of Unserved airport (in priority area).
