                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) The Consumer Price Index-Combined Inflation in the month of December 2019 was registered at 7.35 per cent. Details of inflation of major groups of CPI-C in December, 2019 are given in Table 1.Table 1: Inflation for major groups of CPI-C (per cent)Description	Weights	December, 2019All Groups	100.0	7.35Food & beverages	45.9	12.16Pan, tobacco & intoxicants	2.4	3.37Clothing & footwear	6.5	1.50Housing	10.1	4.30Fuel and light	6.8	0.70Miscellaneous	28.3	4.17Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme ImplementationAs per the Ministry of Finance, Government of India Notification dated 5th August, 2016 issued under Section 45ZA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the upper tolerance level for inflation is 6 per cent.(b) to (c): Price level and therefore inflation of any commodity is an outcome of the interplay of the demand and supply factors. The monetary policy of Reserve Bank of India predominantly affects the demand side of the economy.    (d) to (e): The inflation target under monetary policy framework was notified for the period 5th August, 2016 to 31st March, 2021. (f): As per notification by Ministry of Finance dated 27th June, 2016, if the average inflation is more than or lower than the prescribed tolerance level for three consecutive quarters, only then would it mean a failure to achieve the inflation target. The CPI-C inflation during each of the months of the previous three quarters ending in December 2019 may be seen below in Table 2.Table 2: Consumer Price Index-Combined (CPI-C) Inflation	Apr-19	May-19	Jun-19	Jul-19	Aug-19	Sep-19	Oct-19	Nov-19	Dec-19CPI-C Inflation (per cent)	2.99	3.05	3.18	3.15	3.28	3.99	4.62	5.54	7.35Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation*****
