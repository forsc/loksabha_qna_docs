Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component is being implemented by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, while Watershed Development component (WDC) of PMKSY is being implemented by Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development. Under PMKSY-AIBP, 99 projects having ultimate potential of 76.03 lakh hectare have been prioritized for completion.

The achievement by CADWM component upto March, 2021 is 14.96 lakh hectare of cultivable command area, along with formation of 8,562 Water Users Associations.
