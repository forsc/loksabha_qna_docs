ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING ( RAO INDERJIT SINGH)   (a) and (b) The objective of the scheme is to enable MPs to recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs to be taken up in their Constituencies.  Thus creation of all durable community assets of developmental nature based on local needs are already permissible under the MPLAD Scheme. The last updated Guidelines on MPLADS as on June 2016 along with new circulars on the scheme are available in the public domain on the website of this Ministry at www.mplads.gov.in. (c)  The MPLAD funds are released by the Ministry on the basis of the prescribed documents furnished by the respective District Nodal Authority of the concerned MPs as per the guidelines on MPLADS. Delays in release of funds occur due to non-receipt of the prescribed documents from the District Nodal Authorities. Number of Constituencies in Kerala that are yet to receive funds is Annexed as Annexure–I. (d) As on 04.07.2019 out of the Rs 11,525.00 Crores released during the 16th Lok Sabha Rs. 1,641.98 Crores remained unutilized.  (e) This Ministry holds annual review meeting in addition to regular correspondence with State Government to emphasize timely completion of works, utilization of funds and timely submission of requisite documents. Wherever delay, violation of Guidelines etc. in implementation of works is noted, the State Government / District Authority are advised to take appropriate action.                                                  *****
