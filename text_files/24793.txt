                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b):	Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that:-•	During frying, Total Polar Compounds (TPC) are formed which beyond certain limits make the oil unfit for human consumption.  FSSAI has notified regulations on 1st July, 2018 which prescribe the limit for Total Polar Compounds (TPC) to be maximum 25 percent, beyond which the cooking oil is unsafe for use. •	In Schedule 4 of Food Safety Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations 2011, it is prescribed that reheating of oil should be avoided which shall not exceed more than three times but in any case, cooking oil having developed TPC more than 25%  shall not be used. •	Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) is an initiative of FSSAI in partnership with Biodiesel Association of India, to create an ecosystem to collect and convert the Used Cooking Oil (UCO) into Biodiesel thereby ensuring   a check on diversion of Used Cooking Oil into Food Chain.  Under this initiative, UCO is being collected from FBOs by authorised aggregators (collecting agencies) and transported to a bio-diesel plant, for conversion. 33 Biodiesel manufacturers and 19 aggregators have got themselves enrolled under the initiative.(c):	The provisions relating to offences and penalties have been prescribed under chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, wherein provision of graded penalty and punishment have been prescribed. Any violation of the prescribed standards and norms is punishable under the relevant penal provisions.
