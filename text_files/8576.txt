ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b) : Indian banknotes have several features which enable the visually impaired (colour blind, partially sighted and blind people) to identify them, viz., intaglio printing and tactile mark, variable banknote size, large numerals, variable colour, monochromatic hues and patterns. Once the old series banknotes are withdrawn from circulation, identification of the new series banknotes will automatically become easy for the visually impaired. As indicated in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of June 6, 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has embarked upon exploring alternative technological solutions to help the visually impaired in identifying the denomination of banknotes. Accordingly RBI is in the process of developing a mobile application (both iOS and Android) for aiding the visually impaired in identification of denomination of banknotes.(c) & (d):	RBI will introduce varnished banknotes of ?100 denomination in Mahatma Gandhi (New) Series on a field trial basis in order to increase the life of Indian banknotes. ***
