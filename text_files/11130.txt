ANSWER




MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRAPRADHAN)(a) to (c) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (C) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 4 BY SHRI HIBI EDEN TO BE ANSWERED ON 3RD FEBRUARY, 2020 REGARDING ‘LOW CONSUMPTION BY PMUY BENEFICIARIES’.(a) & (b) The refill consumption of LPG consumers under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), who are at least one year old is 3.27 refills/annum. Adoption and use of LPG on sustained basis by a beneficiary of PMUY depends on various factors including behavioural changes.(c) Government has introduced the targeted Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT/PAHAL) system to directly transfer the subsidy in the account of LPG consumers. This initiative has cut subsidy leakages and helped in curbing diversion of subsidised LPG. This has also helped in identifying ‘ghost’, multiple and inactive LPG accounts.Further, while receiving applications for a new connection, Proof of identity (POI) and Proof of Address (POA) are collected to ascertain the identity of customers. KYC details are also collected at the time of transfer cases and reactivation of suspended/inactive/blocked connections. Multiple connections have been identified based on Inter/Intra company de-duplication based on aadhaar, bank accounts, name & address, Abridged Household List Temporary Identification Number(AHL-TIN), ration card and thereafter blocked with intimation to the customers for surrender of such connection(s).-------
