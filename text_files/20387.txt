ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) 	As reported by the State, district-wise details of Arsenic and Fluoride-affected habitations in Assam, is annexed.(b) & (c) Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to provide potable tap water supply to every rural household in the country by 2024. Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to households, priority is given to quality–affected habitations.While allocating the funds under JJM to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is been given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Arsenic and Fluoride. In 2020-21, allocation of funds under JJM to Assam has been increased to Rs. 1,407.07 Crore from Rs. 694.34 Crore in 2019-20.In March 2017, to provide potable drinking water to 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride-affected habitations in the country, including 3,881 habitations of Assam,National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched, which has now been subsumed under JJM. For this purpose, Rs. 530.96 crore has been released to Assam.Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source takes time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.As reported by the State, provision of potable drinking water for cooking and drinking purposes have been made in all Arsenic and Fluoride–affected habitations.***
