ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	 Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 mandated agricultural crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.Contd…2/--2-The Government in its Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times of the cost of production.  Accordingly, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19 onwards. (Annex I).(b)        India has witnessed record foodgrain production of 296.65 million tonnes during 2019-20 (4th advance estimates) as against 285.21 million tonnes during 2018-19. Details are given at Annex II. (c):     Government has announced MSP of Rabi crops on 21 Sep 2020 for the Rabi Marketing Season 2021-22. (d) & (e):    Procurement details of Kharif crops during the last three years, statewise and the number of farmers benefitted are given at Annex III. (f):       Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. While recommending its price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. The estimates of cost of cultivation/cost of production are made available to CACP through the Central Sector Scheme on “Comprehensive Scheme for Studying the Cost of Cultivation of Principal Crops”, under which cost of cultivation data are collected with the help of State Agricultural Universities/Institutions located in various States.             The costs include all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred in cash and kind on the use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour. Hence the costs considered are very comprehensive and based on the methodology recommended by Expert Committees from time to time.          In addition to cost of production CACP also considers various other factors while recommending MSP which include overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, likely effect of price policy on rest of economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production.(g):       MSP is determined for the country as a whole and not region or state-specific. Region specific parameters are kept in view by the CACP while formulating price policy for agricultural commodities. The details of increase in MSP is given in Annex I. (h):       The NITI Aayog has conducted a study entitled “Efficacy of minimum support prices on farmers”.
