                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d) 	To enable every rural household in the country to have potable water supply through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, Jal Jeevan Mission is implemented in partnership with States, with an estimated outlay of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore. While allocating the funds under JJM to States/ UTs, 10% weightage has been given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants. Under JJM, while planning for potable water supply to households through tap water connections, priority is to be given to quality-affected habitations. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source takes time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations to provide potable water to every household as well as schools, aanganwadi, health centres, etc. at the rate of 8- 10 litre per capita per day to meet drinking and cooking requirements.In 2020-21, a sum of Rs. 23,500 Crore has been allocated toJal Jeevan Mission, out of which Rs. 11,500 Crore as Gross Budgetary Support and Rs. 12,000 Crore as Extra Budgetary Resource.****
