                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	The Government has proposed to address the issue of barren land by implementing programs to increase cropping area, restore soil health, promote water conservation in agriculture etc.  To achieve these aims several schemes such as Reclamation of Problem Soils,  Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) etc are operational in the country.  In addition, the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one of the Missions under the National Action Plan for Climate Change is being implemented. The Mission aims to evolve and implement strategies to make Indian agriculture more resilient.NMSA was approved for three major components i.e. Rainfed Area Development (RAD); On Farm Water Management (OFWM); and Soil Health Management (SHM).Subsequently, four new programmes were introduced namely Soil Health Card (SHC), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) and Sub Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF). During 2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was operationalised wherein the OFWM component of NMSA was subsumed under the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY.  The Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched in April 2018. Implementation of these schemes / programmes addresses issues related to barren land and food security in the country. *********
