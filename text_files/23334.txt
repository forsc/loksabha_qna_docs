Bio-control agents are mass multiplied in laboratories and released in farmer fields, which reduce the pest infestation and thus avoid crop loss. Farmers are also trained on farm production of Biocontrol agents, Entomo-pathogens and antagonistic fungi & bacteria on their own to reduce the dependency on chemical pesticides. Further, farmers are made aware about conservation of natural enemies by Central Integrated Pest Management Centers and mass multiplied bio-control agents are released in farmer fields for holistic management of pest & diseases.
