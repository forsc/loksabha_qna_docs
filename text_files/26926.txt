At present there are 18 LCs in Satara district, out of which 9 LCs are sanctioned for replacement by Road over Bridges/Road under Bridges (ROBs/RUBs).(b): Railway has policy to eliminate the level crossings having Traffic Vehicle Unit (TVU)>1 lakh by replacing them with ROBs/RUBs on cost sharing basis. Further, LCs are also eliminated by construction of ROB/RUBs at the cost of Railways or State Government, based on their requirement, if technically feasible.(c): Adequate drainage arrangement has been made integral part of planning of new underbridges. In existing underbridges several measures like water flow diversion to nearest bridge & nallahs, provision of covered shed on approach roads, provision of hump at entry to RUB, provision of drain etc. have been made as per requirements. In addition, pumping arrangement has also been made in identified RUBs, to drain out water expeditiously in case of emergency.*****
