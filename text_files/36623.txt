                                                              MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Government has surveyed defence land located outside Cantonments across the country. The State/ UT-wise details of the same is enclosed herewith as Annexure-A. In addition, demarcation of boundaries of 62 Cantonments has also been carried out. Cantonment-wise details of defence land (Inside Cantonment) is enclosed as Annexure–B.(c)&(d): The unutilized land is primarily used to cater for the future needs of the Forces. Requests for transfer of defence land received from Central Govt. Departments, State Governments and organisations controlled by it and also local bodies for execution of public infrastructure / utility projects are considered on merits, if it is felt that the land can be alienated without compromising the essential functions of the user service as per terms and conditions contained in Ministry of Defence letters dated 02.02.2016 & 21.10.2020.*****
