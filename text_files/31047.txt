ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	No Sir, Exporters and artisans are integral part of the supply chain of handicraft exports. The profit margins of exports are shared among the partners including the artisans. Eligible handicraft artisans are also sponsored fully for participating in international marketing events under Marketing Support and Services Scheme of Office of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts). Further, the Government has taken several steps in promoting the interests of artisans. Every year the government organizes domestic marketing events like Gandhi Craft Bazaar, Craft Bazaar and Exhibitions to provide marketing platform to the artisans. Steps have been taken to on-board artisans on e-commerce platforms. Producer companies have also been formed to facilitate sale of products directly by the artisans.***
