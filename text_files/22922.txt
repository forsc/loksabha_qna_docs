These schemes include Nagar Van Yojana, School Nursery Yojana, afforestation under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), National Mission for a Green India (GIM) etc., and are implemented to promote afforestation, urban forestry, tree plantation on vacant lands and bunds on farm lands etc. by involving local communities, NGOs, educational institutions, local bodies, etc.  In specific respect to urban areas, the MoEFCC has encouraged tree planting/ afforestation under the Nagar Van Udyan Yojana. An amount of Rs. Rs. 51.24 crore (for 46 Nagar Van Udyans) was released to various States during 2015-16 to 2018-19. The scheme Nagar Van Udyan has since been re-structured and approved during the year 2020 to be implemented as Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) for creation of Nagar Van (city forest) in urban areas over a period of five years at a total estimated cost of Rs.415.00 crore for under the National Fund of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). A total of 18 Nagar Van projects in 12 States have been approved for implementation under NVY during the year 2020-21, at a cost of Rs. 27.91 crore, so far. The following additional steps taken by the Government contribute to conservation and development of forests in the country including in the metropolitan cities: i.

The Ministry also provides financial supports to the States /UTs under Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme for protection against forest fire. ii.	The MoEFCC is implementing two major afforestation schemes namely National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests through people’s participation and National Mission for a Green India (GIM), under which in addition to other sub-missions, there is a specific sub-mission for enhancing tree cover in urban and peri-urban areas. An area over 2 million hectare was sanctioned for taking up afforestation in the States/Union Territories (UTs) with an investment of about Rs. 3896 crores till 2019-20 under NAP since its launching year 2000 and under GIM an amount of about Rs. 343 crore has been released to States/UTs since 2015-16 to 2019-20.iii.	Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Mission launched by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) also aims for increasing the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks). As per information received from Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), 1776 No. of parks over 3500 acres of land have been developed in the Mission cities.iv.
