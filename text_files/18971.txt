ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) The Ministry, in association with the Department of Posts, decided in January 2017 to open Passport Kendras at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/ Post Offices (PO) in the country called ‘Post Office Passport Seva Kendra’ (POPSK) in each Parliamentary constituency where there is no Passport Seva Kendra (PSK).(b) The list of 426 functional POPSKs in the country is placed at Annexure-I. (c) Out of 48 Parliamentary (Lok Sabha) Constituencies in Maharashtra, there are 37 POPSKs and 8 Passport Seva Kendras covering 44 Parliamentary Constituencies. The Ministry is working with the Department of Posts to operationalize POPSKs at remaining four Lok Sabha Constituencies. (d)	The Ministry has eased the passport issuing process and has made it an online procedure including getting appointments for submission of documents for passports. Effective technical infrastructure is in place to ensure that the Passport Seva system is available for access at all times from any location. The Passport Portal (www.passportindia.gov.in) is accessible to anyone, anywhere and anytime. With a view to address the challenge of digital divide, especially in the rural hinterland, the Ministry in association with Common Service Centres e-Governance Services India Ltd. (which is promoted by the Department of Electronics and IT), has facilitated online filing of passport applications, through the vast network of CSCs across rural hinterland.Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) are being set up in association with the Department of Posts in order to bring passport services closer to people residing in villages/remote/rural areas of the country. Applicants, who apply for their passports online through the passport portal, can schedule an appointment and then visit the designated POPSK to complete the formalities, prior to the issue of the passport. The photographs, biometrics and the supporting documents would be electronically captured at the POPSK prior to the issue of the Passport.		Opening of POPSK has facilitated the Ministry in taking passport services closer to the citizens of the country.***
