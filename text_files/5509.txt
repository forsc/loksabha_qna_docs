                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 449 BY SHRI RAMCHARAN BOHRA AND SHRI DEVJI  M. PATEL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019 REGARDING TENURE/SERVICE PERIOD OF SENIOR OFFICERS(a) : Existing guidelines/instructions regarding posting/transfer of railway officers including those issued by the Central Vigilance Commission were compiled into a Comprehensive Transfer Policy (CTP) issued on 31.08.2015 which was modified from time to time.   The salient features of the CTP are:-•	Ordinarily a Group A officer will not be transferred out of his allotted Zone /Unit till Selection Grade;  •	Officers are considered for posting to Railway Board, Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO), Central Training Institutes (CTIs), Production Units (PUs) and other Units on completion of minimum of 5 years in allotted zone.  •	Postings in Railway Board, CTIs, RDSO & Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) have a maximum tenure of 5 years.•	Normally, minimum tenure on a particular post at a time will be 2 years and maximum tenure will be 5 years. •	For sensitive posts, maximum tenure will be 4 years. •	Total stay at a stretch at a particular station should not be more than 10 years (15 years for Indian Railway Medical Service Officers (IRMS) and the cumulative stay (in broken spells), should not be more than 15 years (20 years for IRMS). Deputation to other Ministries/Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) is not counted for this purpose.•	A government servant who is also a caregiver of a disabled child may be exempted from the routine exercise of transfer/rotational transfer subject to administrative constraints.•	Every effort will be made to post husband and wife at the same station. (b) There are very few officers over staying in Delhi/Zonal Headquarter, beyond their prescribed tenure for various reasons - like care-giving to a disabled child, education of children, critical/terminal illness etc. A close watch is kept to minimize such cases and transfer the officers.(c) As per circulars dated 25.10.18 and 30.11.18, posting of Railway Officers in Railway Board and PSUs up to Senior Administrative Grade are based on applications through vacancy circulars and job requirement. Posting in Delhi and Northern Railway is also decided on the basis of job-requirement and experience of the officers in the relevant field.(d) & (e) A Comprehensive Transfer Policy already exists.*****
