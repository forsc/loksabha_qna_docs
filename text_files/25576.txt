ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1421 BY SHRI DEVJI M. PATEL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING REDEVELOPMENT OF STATIONS LIKE ADARSH STATIONS(a) and (b): Yes, Sir. For development of Railway stations, this Ministry has formulated various schemes for upgradation/modernization/augmentation of stations on Indian Railways under various developmental schemes viz. Model, Modern and Adarsh Station Schemes.Presently, Railway stations are upgraded/modernized under ‘Adarsh’ Station Scheme based on identified need of providing better enhanced passenger amenities at stations. In the State of Rajasthan, 40 stations have been identified under Adarsh Station Scheme and out of these, 38 stations have been upgraded/developed under this scheme. The remaining 02 stations are targeted to be developed under Adarsh Station Scheme in Financial Year 2021-22. In addition, a dedicated umbrella has been created for the financial year 2020-21 specifically for “Soft Upgrades at stations” (like improvement in station buildings, tall flags, steel benches, cover over platform, etc.).  Various passenger amenities works like improvement to façade of the station building, retiring room, waiting room, separate waiting room with toilet for ladies, landscaping of circulating area, earmarked parking, signages, Pay & Use toilets, ramps at entry to station for physically handicapped and senior citizens etc. are undertaken under the umbrella as per the respective category of the station depending upon need, volume of passenger traffic and inter-se priority, subject to availability of funds.  Jalore, Bheenmal, Raniwada, Modran, Aburoad, Pindwara and Swaroopganj Railway stations fall under the jurisdiction of North Western Railway.  During the financial year 2021-22, an outlay of ` 3.00 crore has been provided to North Western Railway for the umbrella work of Soft upgrade at stations.(c)  All the Minimum Essential Amenities as per norms are available at Jalore, Bheenmal, Raniwada, Modran, Aburoad, Pindwara and Swaroopganj Railway stations. Jalore and Aburoad stations have already been developed under Adarsh Station Scheme. Further, upgradation/modernization of stations on Indian Railways is a continuous and on-going process and works in this regard are undertaken as per requirement. However, priority for upgradation/modernization of stations is accorded to higher category of station over lower category of station while sanctioning and executing the work.(d)  No separate station-wise fund is allocated. However, at Jalore, Bheenmal, Raniwada & Modran stations about ` 1.5 crore has been incurred on infrastructure works like toilet for Divyanjan, waiting room, extension of platform, etc. Further, ` 5.46 crore at Aburoad, ` 1.16 crore at Pindwara and ` 2.46 crore at Swaroopganj Railway station have been incurred on passenger amenities items.*****
