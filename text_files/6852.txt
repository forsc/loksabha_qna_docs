                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 551 BY SHRI JASWANT SINGH BHABHOR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 20.11.2019 REGARDING PENDING ROB/RUB IN GUJARAT(a) to (e): There are 1786 manned level crossings on Broad Gauge in Gujarat.  127 No. of Road Over Bridges (ROBs) have been sanctioned in Pink Book in Gujarat.  Out of these, 9 works are fully completed, in 6 works Railway portion is completed and the remaining works are at various stages of planning, estimation and execution.  Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs in Railway portion.  However, it is difficult to construct ROBs on approaches because it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds, etc.  Therefore, it is not possible to fix the time schedule for construction of ROB projects.*****
