The data is analysed for the road accidents issues on the basis of data from the Department of Police of the States/UTs. Analyses of road accident data reported by the police department of States/UTs reveals that road Accidents are multicaused and are a result of interplay of various factors which can broadly be categorized into human error, Road condition/environment and vehicular condition.             The Ministry has taken various initiatives to promote road safety which include:		The Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019 passed by Parliament focuses on road safety and includes, inter-alia, revision in penalties for traffic violations, electronic monitoring of the same, enhanced penalties for juvenile driving, computerization/automation of vehicle fitness and driving, tests, recall of defective vehicles, streamlining the third party insurance and payment of increased compensation for hit and run cases etc. The Amendment has strengthened the Law to improve the road Safety scenario and reduce loss of lives. The Ministry issues regulations to improve vehicle safety standards, undertakes site specific interventions to address black spots, and also mobilises various activities to promote road safety such as road safety advocacy and awareness programmes. Ministry has notified fitment of Speed Limiting devices on all transport vehicles, issue of Guidelines for protection of Good Samaritans. Besides,(i)	Scheme for setting up of model Driving Training Institutes in States/UTs with central assistance.(ii)	Scheme for setting up one model Inspection & Certification Centre in each State/UT with Central assistance for testing the fitness of vehicles through an automated system.(iii)	Observance of National Road Safety Week every year for spreading awareness and strengthening road safety.(iv)	Road safety has been made an integral part of road design at planning stage.

No. RW/NH-33044/309/2016/S&R dated 06-04-2017 and 01-06-2017.	As per Section 165(1) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a State Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of the third party so arising, or both. Sub-section (2) of Section 165 empowers the State Government to appoint such number of members as the State Government may think fit to appoint. Sub-section (3) of Section 165 empowers State Government to regulate distribution of business if there are two or more Claims Tribunals for an area. Thus, the matter regarding disposal of cases by Motor Accident Claims Tribunals comes under the jurisdiction of the State Government.(c)	    Road tax is collected and utilized by the State Government.(d)	The Ministry implements scheme of publicity measures and awareness campaigns on road safety to create awareness among road users through the electronic media, print media, NGOs etc..
