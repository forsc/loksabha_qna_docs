ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d):  Electoral roll is prepared under the superintendence, direction and control of the Election Commission of India, as established under the Constitution.There is a robust legal and technology platform for ensuring that Aadhaar data is used for the purpose for which it is collected. The proposed amendment in the election laws vide the Election Laws (amendment) Act, 2021 places Aadhaar as one of the options for correctly identifying the voter data.  It is understood that using Aadhaar for voter ID is not mandatory. Therefore, the legal provisions of Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 for governance of Aadhaar data are followed as per law. ********
