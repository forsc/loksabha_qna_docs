ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	to (c) Erstwhile Planning Commission /NITI Aayog approved/sanctioned the project proposals received from State Governments under One Time Additional Central Assistance (OTACA)/ Special Plan Assistance (SPA) till 2014-2015 and recommended to the Ministry of Finance for the release of funds. Subsequent to the establishment of NITI Aayog, the practice of approval/sanctioning of such project proposals has been discontinued from 2015-16 following the acceptance of recommendations of 14th Finance Commission for increased devolution to the States by way of enhancing the share of States in the net proceeds of Union Taxes from 32% to 42% resulting in increased fund transfer to the States. NITI Aayog is the successor in interest to the Planning Commission. It is a think tank to the Government to provide a critical directional and strategic input into the development process. Approval of Central/State projects is no longer under the purview of the NITI Aayog.****
