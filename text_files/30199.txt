ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to enhance regional air connectivity from unserved and underserved airports in the country  for making air travel affordable to the masses. Under RCS - UDAN, 948 valid routes have been awarded across length and breadth in the country, of which, 395 Routes connecting 63 unserved and underserved airports including 6 Heliports & 2 water aerodromes have been operationalized. 1,55,776 RCS flights and 80.12  lakhs passengers have flown under the scheme as on 14.11.2021.(c): Most of the UDAN flights are operating at Visual Flight Rules (VFR) airports where minimum 5 Km visibility is required for operations as per extant rules and regulations. Thus, the Selected Airline Operator (SAO) cannot operate UDAN flight in case, visibility is less than 5 Km considering the safety aspects. (d):  So far, no helicopter route connecting Hindon to other airport has been awarded under UDAN. No cancellation of helicopter operation from Hindon to other airports has taken place under UDAN. (e): RCS - UDAN is a market driven scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN. Under UDAN scheme, airlines eligibility criteria states that the operator should have Schedule Operator Permit (SOP) / Schedule Commuter Operator (SCO) permit to operate the routes awarded under the Scheme and should  ensure efficient operations of the UDAN flights. Moreover, UDAN scheme is reviewed in consultation with stakeholders including SAO periodically and necessary course corrections, if required, are carried out.
