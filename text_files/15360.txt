ANSWER




                                                        a):  National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has published the 71st Round Survey Report titled ‘Social Consumption - Education Survey 2014’, which inter-alia covers IT Literacy. As per this report, the proportion of households in the Country having computer was found to be around 14% (only 6% of rural households and 29% of urban households possessed computer).  Among  people  in  the  age  group  of  14-29  years  in  rural  India,  only  18%  were able  to  operate  a  computer.  Similarly,   in  the  age  group  of  30-45  years,  the  percentage dropped further to 4%. In the age group of 46-60 years, the percentage was just more than 1%.  This  highlighted  that  more  than  15  crore  rural  households  (94%  of  16.85  crore households)  did  not  have  computers. The State/UT-wise details of households having computer (including Maharashtra and Tripura) is at Annexure.(b): The steps taken by the Government to bridge the digital literacy divide in the country include the following: i.	In the years 2014 to 2016, two Schemes entitled “National Digital Literacy Mission” (NDLM) and “Digital Saksharta Abhiyan” (DISHA) were implemented by the Government with a target to train 52.50 lakh candidates in digital literacy across the country including rural India. Under these two schemes, a total of 53.67 lakh beneficiaries were trained, out of which around 42% candidates were from rural India.ii.	In February 2017, the Government of India approved a scheme titled “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)” to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household). Special focus of the said Scheme is on training the beneficiaries on use of Electronic Payment System. So far, more than 3.54 crore candidates have been enrolled and around 2.88 crore have been trained, out of which more than 2.11 crore candidates have been certified under the PMGDISHA Scheme. (c):  The National Digital Literacy Mission is now closed. However, under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan” (PMGDISHA), approximately  Rs. 48.26 crore and Rs. 2.11 crore have been allocated and spent in the States of  Maharashtra and Tripura respectively. In Madha Parliamentary constituency of Maharashtra, approximately Rs. 25.42 Lakh has been allocated and spent under the aforementioned scheme. The status of candidates registered, trained and certified during the last three years in Madha constituency of Maharashtra and in the state of Tripura is as under:(i)	Madha constituency (Maharashtra) :FY	Registered	Trained	Certified2017-18	5,029	4419	38282018-19	2,715	2449	22372019-till date	931	524	439(ii)	State of Tripura :FY	Registered	Trained	Certified2017-18	33,374	22,887	17,8462018-19	33,428	25,628	17,7922019-till date	33,433	21,614	18,403*******AnnexureNSSO 71st Round Survey Report titled ‘Social Consumption-Education Survey 2014’Proportion (per 1000) of households having computer for each State/UTSl.
