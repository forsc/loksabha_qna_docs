ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):	Yes Sir.  British India Corporation Ltd. (BICL) has been incurring losses since its nationalization in the year 1981. Owing to continuance losses, BIC was referred to Board for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) in 1991 and was declared sick in 1992. The government approved revival schemes in November, 2001, 2005 and 2011 also failed.  The Handicrafts & Handloom Export Corporation of India Limited (HHEC) has been continuously incurring losses for a long time and there is little scope for revival of these PSUs.The concerns of employees/work force of these organizations will be dealt with as per the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises on closure of sick/ loss making Central Public Sector Enterprises.***
