                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): State-wise demand/supply of coal is not assessed separately. All India demand and domestic supply of coal during last three years and current year is given below:- Year	2018-19 	 	2019-20  	2020-21(provisional)	2021-22Actual Demand (MT)	968.36	 	955.92	906.07	1142.00#Domestic Supply (MT)	733.01	 	707.39	691.08	195.17** Upto June, 2021,    MT – Million Tonne  # Estimated Demand In 2021-22 the coal production up to June, 2021 is 155.84 MT and domestic coal supply is 195.17 MT.  The state wise details of production and despatch of coal during last three year is under:-(In Million Tonnes)State	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21 	Production	Despatch	Production	Despatch	Production	DespatchAssam	0.784	0.754	0.517	0.562	0.036	0.09Chhattisgarh	161.893	161.984	157.745	147.076	158.409	146.249Jammu & Kashmir	0.013	0.016	0.014	0.01	0.012	0.012Jharkhand	134.666	136.061	131.763	132.418	119.296	117.959Madhya Pradesh	118.661	103.404	125.726	109.283	132.531	105.385Maharashtra	49.818	51.793	54.746	50.008	47.435	46.571Orissa	144.312	142.464	143.016	135.878	154.15	151.912Telengana	65.16	68.426	65.703	64.122	52.603	50.533Uttar Pradesh	20.275	36.654	18.03	34.775	17.016	38.355West Bengal	33.136	33.238	33.614	33.044	34.596	33.822 (b) :  The focus of the Government is on increasing domestic production of coal through allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal. The following action has  been taken by Government to enhance the production of the coal in the country :i. Launch of Commercial Auction: Auction of commercial mining on revenue sharing mechanism from 5 coal bearing states (Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh) was launched on 18.06.2020. During this round of auction, 20 coal mines with aggregate peak capacity of 59 MTPA were successfully auctioned.   Second Tranche of auction for commercial mining was launched by Ministry of Coal on 25.03.2021. In the second Tranche, a total of 67coal mines/blocks were offered.  Further to cater to the demand of the coking coal consumers, 6 coking coal mines have been put on offer. The cumulative PRC for the fully explored mines on offer has been estimated at 150 MTPA.ii. Concept of Rolling Auction: In order to expedite the process for conducting auction and to carry out more rounds of auction in a year, a mechanism of rolling auctions of coal mines has been planned.  Under this mechanism, upon completion of the electronic auction process of a tranche (i.e. approximately 3-4 months from the launch of auction process), the next tranche of auction would be launched for following mines:a. Mines where no bid or only single bid was received in the previous tranche of auction (except for those mines where Ministry of Coal decides to go for second attempt of auction)b. New mines, if any, identified by Ministry of Coal iii. Engagement of PMU: Project Management Unit (PMU) has been engaged by Ministry of Coal for handholding of coal block allottees for obtaining various approvals /clearances for early operationalisation of coal mines allocated under CMSP Act, 2015. iv. Launch of Single Window Clearance: The Union government has launched Single Window Clearance portal for the coal sector to speed up the operationalisation of coal mines. It is an unified platform that facilitates grant of clearances and approvals required for starting a coal mine in India.  v. The MMDR Act has been amended in March, 2021 which, inter alia, allows all captive mines to sell up to 50% of the minerals produced during the year after meeting the requirement of attached plant.vi. CIL has taken the following steps to achieve the target of augmentation of coal production capacity:1.	Implementing on-going projects in time bound manner to achieve targeted production as per schedule.2.	Introduction of Surface Miners in Open Cast (OC) mines to improve operational efficiency and cater to environmental needs.3.	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines.4.	15 Projects identified with a Capacity of about 160 MTPA (Million Tonnes per Annum) to be operated by Mine Developer cum Operator mode.5.	Capacity addition through special dispensation in Environment Clearance under clause 7(ii) of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 20066.	CIL has taken steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading system under ''First Mile Connectivity'' projects. (c):The Country –wise import of Coal along with value last three years is given Annexure.(d): An Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted in July, 2017 to recommend rationalization of coal linkages of the Independent Power Producers and based on the recommendations of the IMTF, the Methodology for Linkage Rationalization for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) was issued on 15.05.2018.  Coal India Limited has carried out 2 rounds of linkage rationalization under this Policy.****             AnnexureSource Country Wise Import of Coal, Coke and Lignite to India During 2020-21( Quantity
