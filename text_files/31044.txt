THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Investment in the textile industry is by and large by the private sector and no information on state-wise investments is available. However, Government of India facilitates the textile industry for development and modernization by providing subsidy on investments made under various Schemes. Funds are released to achieve the desired objectives under various schemes on year to year basis. The textile agencies/organizations in the States involved in textile activities are the beneficiary agencies of above schemes.  In addition, financial assistance is provided for raw materials, Common infrastructure development, marketing of handloom products in domestic/overseas markets, loans at concessional rates, etc. (b) & (c):  Textile industry is predominantly in the unorganized sector and the government does not maintain any such data. The government has taken following major initiatives/ measures in textile sector to boost exports, production, demand and job opportunities in the sector on pan-India basis:i)	         To boost exports in MMF sector, Government has removed anti-dumping duty on PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid), a key raw material for the manufacture of MMF fibre and yarn and also on Acrylic fibre, a raw material for yarn and knitwear industry. ii)	The Government has approved setting up of Seven PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks in Greenfield/Brownfield sites including plug and play facility with an outlay of Rs. 4445 cr for a period of seven years upto 2027-28.

The scheme will enable creation of global champions in exports.iii)	The Production Linked Investment scheme of Rs 10,683/- crore over a five-year period covering MMF and Technical Textiles sector has been announced which will create global champions in exports and domestic production in textile sector will also grow substantially.iv)	In order to make the textile sector competitive by rebating all taxes/levies in international market, Government has also given its approval for continuation of Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) on exports of Apparel/Garments and Made-ups till  31st March 2024.		In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry. These schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country.
