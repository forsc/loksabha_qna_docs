ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (c)	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement referred to in reply to Part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 426 by Shri Ramdas C. Tadasto be answered on 01.04.2022 regarding “New Norms on Malnutrition”.(a) to (b)There is no new criteria recommended by WHO on malnutrition.  The new Child Growth Standards to identify malnutrition in children were released by WHO in 2006. These Standards have been adopted by Government of India w.e.f. 15.8.2008 following the recommendations of the National Workshop on the Adoption of new WHO Child Growth Standards, organized jointly, by Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, with WHO and UNICEF collaboration on 8-9th February, 2007 at New Delhi.Based on the new criteria for growth standards, the growth charts were revised under the ICDS programme and the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and ICDS functionaries were oriented/trained on the new growth charts/standards. The revised growth charts were shared across states to replace the existing Growth Monitoring registers. Thereafter, these have been in use to assess the nutritional status of children under 5 years of age. Correct assessment of underweight children is beneficial for timely interventions which in turn will help in improving the nutritional status.  As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-V, the percentage of malnourished and severely malnourished children under 5 years of age is 19.3% and 7.7% respectively. (c)	These new standards were different from the previous standards in the following ways,?	The new Standards are based on SD (Standard Deviation) Internationally accepted classification ?	New Standards are gender specific while old standards are unisex. ?	Further, the WHO Child Growth Standards are based on the growth of breastfed children (which is the norm for healthy growth) All children grow equally given the right Infant and Young child feeding, appropriate feeding practices, health and nutrition inputs & environment.******
