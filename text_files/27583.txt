MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 296 FOR REPLY ON 09TH AUGUST, 2021 ASKED BYDR. MOHAMMAD JAWED, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENTREGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF NEP:(a): As per National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, implementation of the Policyrequires multiple initiatives and actions, which are to be taken up in a synchronized andsystematic manner, by multiple bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, State/UTGovernments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA,the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools and HEIs.The policy provides different timelines for important themes/sub-sets as well as principlesand methodology for its implementation. Accordingly, this Ministry has communicated to allStates/UT Governments for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020 in letter and spirit.Further, in pursuance of the goals and objectives of the NEP 2020 and to assist States, UTsand other organisations in this task, the Department of School Education & Literacy hasdeveloped an indicative and suggestive NEP Implementation Plan for School Education,‘Students’ and ‘Teachers’ Holistic Advancement through Quality Education (SARTHAQ)’.The major focus of SARTHAQ is to define activities in such a manner which clearlydelineate goals, outcomes and timeframe i.e., it links recommendations of NEP with 297Tasks along with responsible agencies, timelines and 304 outputs of these tasks. SARTHAQis divided in two parts and has been uploaded on the Department’s website under the linksmentioned below:https://dsel.education.gov.in/sites/default/files/SARTHAQ_Part-1_updated.pdfhttps://dsel.education.gov.in/sites/default/files/SARTHAQ_Part-2_updated.pdfIn the Department of Higher Education, the actionable activities have been grouped under 9different themes, namely Multidisciplinary and Holistic Education; Equity & Inclusion;Research, Innovation & Ranking; Global Outreach of Higher Education; Motivated,Energized & Capable Faculty; Integrated Higher Education System; Governance andRegulation; IKS, Languages, Culture & Values; Technology Use and Integration. UGC andAICTE have formed 17 different Expert Groups on these themes. Also 20 Sub-groups ofExperts have been formed in respect of various sub-themes. Approximately, 740 outputshave been identified along with Implementing Agencies and the time line for these activities.(b): The Department of School Education and Literacy has constituted subject/theme wise committees under the bureau head/ head of Autonomous bodies concerned onvarious recommendations of NEP i.e. Toy based pedagogy, Joint task force for ECCE,expansion of TET at all stages, NDEAR, Development of guidelines for incentivising private& philanthropic activities, Foundational Literacy & Numeracy, School Standards, HolisticProgress Card etc.Further, a Review Committee for review of the Implementation of NEP 2020 has beenconstituted on 17.02.2021 under the chairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan.(c): One of the fundamental principles of NEP 2020 is ‘substantial investment in astrong, vibrant public education system as well as the encouragement and facilitation of truephilanthropic private and community participation’. Accordingly, NEP 2020 unequivocallyendorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education by both theCentral government and all State Governments to reach 6% of GDP. The Policy also calls forthe rejuvenation, active promotion, and support for private philanthropic activity in theeducation sector. In particular, over and above the public budgetary support which wouldhave been otherwise provided to them, any public institution can take initiatives towardsraising private philanthropic funds to enhance educational experiences.Para 27.3 of the policy envisages the entire policy to be in an operational mode in the decadeof 2030-40, to be followed by another comprehensive review.(d & e): NEP, 2020 provides for setting up a Gender Inclusion Fund (GIF) especially forgirls and transgender students to build the nation’s capacity to provide equitable qualityeducation for all girls as well as transgender students. The Department has incorporatedseveral interventions for girls in its revamped Samagra Shiksha Scheme, which includesproviding free textbooks & uniforms to all girls at elementary level; ResidentialSchools/Hostels, Transport/Escort Facility, aids and appliances for Children with SpecialNeeds (CWSN); upgradation of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) to provideresidential and schooling facilities upto Class-XII; separate provision of stipend for CWSNgirls @ Rs. 200 per month for 10 months in addition to student component from pre-primaryto senior secondary level; incinerator and sanitary pad vending machines in all girls’ hostelsand self defence training for girls in govt. schools for inculcating skills for self-protectionand self development.*****
