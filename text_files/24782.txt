                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)	Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] was launched by the Government with effect from 2nd October, 2014, with the main aim to make the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2nd October, 2019. Having achieved the outcomes of the ODF, Phase-II of SBM(G) is now being implemented with the focus on ODF sustainability and to make arrangements for Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) in all villages i.e. ODF Plus, by 2024-25. The main features of SBM(G) Phase-II are:(i)	SBM(G) Phase-II has been designed as novel model of convergence among different verticals of financing and various programmes of Centre and State Governments(ii)	Flexibility to States in designing delivery mechanisms taking into account their local culture, practices, sensibilities and demands(iii)	Emphasis on capacity building of the implementing agencies to strengthen delivery of services to the ground level(iv)	Emphasis on decentralized approach for effective Operation and Maintenance of assets constructed under SBM(G)(v)	Encouraging States to promote business models to make the assets self-sustainable (b) 	SBM(G) is demand driven programme, hence no fixed State-wise and year-wise allocation of funds could be made under the programme.  For implementation of the programme, every year State Governments submit their AIPs to the Government of India.  The AIPs are approved by the National Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC) constituted for the purpose.  Funds are released to the States on the basis of their tentative allocation which is decided annually considering their AIPs and overall availability of funds under the programme at national level.  Details of the funds allocated and released to the States under the programme and utilized during the last three years as per the utilization certificates submitted by them are given at Annexure-1, Annexure-2 and Annexure-3 respectively.(c) 	SBM(G) was launched by the Government with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the main aim to make the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2nd October, 2019, by providing access to toilets to all the rural households in the country. More than 10 crore individual household latrines were constructed under the programme during 2014 to 2019.  As a result, all the villages in the country declared themselves ODF as on 2nd October, 2019.  Having achieved the outcomes of the ODF, Phase-II of SBM(G) is now being implemented with the focus on ODF sustainability and to make arrangements for Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) in all villages i.e. ODF Plus, by 2024-25.   (d) 	All the villages in all the district of the country including Rajasthan have declared themselves ODF.(e) & (f) Sanitation is a State subject and hence the responsibility for implementation of the programme lies with the States.  Government of India provides technical and financial support to supplement the efforts of the State Governments.  Complaints, if any, received are forwarded to the respective State Governments for appropriate corrective measures.*****
