ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS   (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) Due to   non-uniformity of standards for ambulances, there was some difference in the   types of ambulances deployed in different projects. At some places, ambulances deployed are simple patient transport vehicles only. Recognizing this, directions have been issued to field units to upgrade the existing ambulances to the standards of Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulances as per AIS-125. Further, NHAI has recently signed contract agreements for  supply, operation and maintenance of 126 AIS-125 compliant Basic Life Support   ambulances across the country.(b)  Road users   generally register all their highway related complaints through 1033 helpline   number and the same are duly addressed by the corresponding Regional Offices and Project Implementation Units at local level itself.(c)   Such data is not maintained at Ministry level.*****
