                                                        THE FINANCE MINISTER(SMT. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 141 BY KUNWAR DANISH ALI DUE FOR ANSWER ON MARCH 2, 2020…..(a) & (c): Owing to strong macroeconomic fundamentals including a manageable current account   deficit, India’s external debt to GDP ratio has been low at about 20 percent of GDP during the last three years. Data on India’s external debt, principal and interest paid to foreign lenders are placed at Annexure.(b): As per IMF and World Bank data, India’s external debt to gross national income (GNI) ratio in 2018 was lowest among the advanced nations of G-20 and 36 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries. India’s external debt to GNI ratio was also lower than two-thirds of around 150 low and middle income countries. Further, India’s external debt per citizen in 2018 was less than all G-20 and OECD countries. (d): India’s external debt burden is very low. For raising the investment rate in the economy, there is a need to increase foreign borrowings to take advantage of lower rate of interest abroad.                                                  *****                                                                         Annexure          External debt outstanding - Annexure to Part (a)--------------------------------------------------------------------------Year	  Long Term	    Short Term	     Total	     Interest rate--------------------------------------------------------------------------	         (year end figures in US$ billion)	        percent--------------------------------------------------------------------------2016-17	    383.2	      88.1	     471.3	          3.52017-18	    427.1	     102.2	     529.3	          3.42018-19	    434.8	     108.4	     543.2	          4.0---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: External Debt Management Unit (EDMU), Aid Accounts & Audit Division (CAAA),  D/o Economic Affairs, M/o Finance and RBI.
