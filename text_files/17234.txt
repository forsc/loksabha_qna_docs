                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) Use of Geographic Information System (GIS) software, application of Artificial intelligence and remote sensing technology will play important role in future mining operations for more scientific, systematic and safe mining operations. Government of India is promoting use of such technology in mining sector. Emphasis is being laid on mechanisation, computerisation, automation and adoption of state of the art technology in the existing and new mining units. To meet the objective of safety and economic production, attention is being given to modern technology.(b) There are provisions for sustainable mining in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, (MCDR) 2017. MCDR, 2017 provides for star rating of the mines based on the implementation of sustainable mining practices in the mining lease area. Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) (A Subordinate Office of Ministry of Mines) monitors the sustainable development in mining sector through star rating system, which is designed and developed as an online system for evaluation of sustainable mining. This is an online system comprising of three layers viz. self assessment, validation and auditing. National Mineral Policy 2019 also provides that all mining shall be undertaken within the parameters of a comprehensive Sustainable Development Framework which will ensure that environmental, economic and social considerations are integrated effectively in mining. (c) The above aspects have been covered under the four modules of Star Rating template for assessment. Government has strengthened its implementation through Rule 35 of MCDR 2017.  (d) Yes, Sir. Government of India has taken care of all these aspects and already put in place a comprehensive Sustainable Mining framework for Indian mining sector, ensuring optimal  mineral extraction with due conservation of minerals, systematic and scientific mining and protection of environment for sustaining the desired GDP growth of our country. *****
