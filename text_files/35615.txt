                                                                                          THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE                                      (DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD)a)& b)  Pursuant to the CCEA’s (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) approval in May 2021 for the strategic disinvestment of Government of India’s (GoI) and LIC’s shareholding along with transfer of management control in IDBI Bank Ltd., road shows are currently being held to assess the investors’ interest before floating the Expression of Interest (EoI).c)	While deciding the terms and conditions of the strategic sale, legitimate concerns of the existing employees and other stakeholders are suitably addressed through appropriate provisions made in the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA).d)	     In the budget speech for Union Budget 2016-17, it was announced that the Government will consider the option of reducing its stake to below 50% in the IDBI Bank. In pursuance of this announcement, LIC had acquired 51% controlling stake in IDBI Bank Ltd. with the approval of IRDAI and RBI. Subsequently, in the budget speech for 2021-22, strategic disinvestment of GoI’s equity in IDBI Bank was announced and as per the CCEA’s decision of May 2021, it has been decided to have strategic disinvestment of GoI and LIC shareholding in IDBI Bank alongwith transfer of management control. It is expected that the strategic buyer will infuse funds, new technology and best management practices for optimal development of business potential and growth of IDBI Bank Ltd. and shall generate more business without dependence on LIC and GoI for capital. Unlocking of resources by the strategic disinvestment of GoI’s equity in IDBI Bank Ltd. would be used to finance the social sector/developmental programs of the Government benefitting the citizens.
