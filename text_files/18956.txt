ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) As per information available on the website www.henleypassportindex.com, the Henley Passport Index ranks all the passports of the world according to the number of countries their holders can travel to visa free. The ranking is based on exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association and lists the countries that can be accessed visa-free, with an electronic visa [e-TA] or with a Visa-on-Arrival. As per the Henley Passport Index available on the website for Q1 2021, India is ranked at 85. (b), (c) & (d)  Extension of Visa free entry and Visa-on-Arrival is a unilateral decision of the receiving country. The Government has been continually making efforts to increase number of countries that may provide Visa free travel and Visa-on-Arrival facilities with an objective of further increasing the number of countries extending Visa free and Visa-on-Arrival facilities to Indian nationals and also in promoting investments and tourism into India from other countries.  	There are 16 countries which provide Visa-free entry to Indian passport holders (List enclosed as Annexure-I) and 43 countries which provide Visa-on-Arrival facility to Indian Passport holders (List enclosed as Annexure-II).(e)	While issuance of visa and visa related process is the sovereign and unilateral decision of the respective country, the matter regarding easier and liberalized visa policy for Indian nationals is taken up regularly in bilateral meetings/ forums with foreign countries. * * *
