ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b):  A virtual Global Investors Roundtable (VGIR) was organised by Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Limited (NIIFL) on 5th November, 2020.    VGIR was attended by  the Prime Minister,  Finance Minister,  MoS (Finance),  key officials of the Government of India and CEOs/CIOs of some of the largest global pension funds and Sovereign Wealth Funds.   It provided an opportunity for investors to share their experience of investing in India and identify potential areas of reform that would help propel India to be a preferred destination for international institutional investors.  Following the Roundtable, one-on-one meetings were also held between the Prime Minister and CEOs/CIOs that attended the Roundtable.  These meetings provided an opportunity to address specific concerns of investors regarding investing in India. During VGIR and the subsequent one-on-one meetings, various CEOs expressed their organization’s commitment to India and their satisfaction with the direction and pace of reforms.   Similar event was organised in January, 2019 alongside Vibrant Gujarat Summit in January 2019.  The event was attended by over 30 large global investors as well as select Indian business leaders.  Feedback and suggestions from the Roundtable led to key outcomes delivered by GOI such as exemption from income tax on infrastructure investments for sovereign wealth funds and pension funds and abolishing of dividend distribution tax. Since the Roundtable in 2019, there has been an increase of investment activity by investors who attended it. BCI, OMERS and PSP signed their first direct infrastructure investment deals in India and Zurich Airport International AG won the bid to develop the greenfield airport in Jewar. Further, investment across infrastructure sub-sectors has increased over the years. ****
