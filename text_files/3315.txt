ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) :  The high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), the global economic slow down, low yields due to intense competition are some reasons that have contributed to the widening gap between revenue and expenses in the airline industry. Over the years, the operational costs for airlines have gone up mainly due to the increase in fuel prices and the depreciation of Rupee.;(b) and (c): As per information made available by the Scheduled Indian Carriers, the statement regarding the financial performance of Scheduled Indian Carriers for last five years is given at Annexure. ;(d): M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited reported aggregated losses during last few quarters which eroded its liquidity and jeopardized its ability to sustain its operations. As a result there were significant overdues towards all creditors including the lessors of the aircrafts, pilots, suppliers, oil companies etc.;(e): Each airline prepares its business plan on the basis of its own market assessment and liabilities. Mobilizing financial resources and ensuring efficient operations as per business plans are the responsibility of the airline. Government of India has no role in raising funds for M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited, as it is an internal matter of the airline. State Bank of India has filed an application under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), which has been admitted by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai on 20 June, 2019 to work out a resolution plan under the said code. Revival of the airlines is now possible only under IBC.
