                                                        (a) and (b)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is implementing a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 .This scheme has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by NSDC and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs. Under the PMKVY 2016-20 scheme, as on 11.11.2019, 69.03 lakh (appx.) candidates have been trained under STT (38.01 lakh) and RPL (31.02 lakh) across the country in various sector. The Statez wise details of the candidates trained in chronological order (highest to order) under PMKVY 2016-20 is given at column (a) of table at Annexure.Under PMKVY 2016-20, for imparting the skill training, the accreditation and affiliation of training centres (TCs) is done under single window IT application known as SMART. As on 11.11.2019, 13,911 TCs have been empanelled under PMKVY 2016-20. The State/UT-wise details of Training Centers under PMKVY 2016-20 are given at column (b) of table at Annexure.(c) and (d) 	CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20 is being implemented pan India by NSDC, thus, no State/UTs-wise fund is sanctioned under this component. However, under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, 25% of the funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Ministry has received proposals from 36 States/UTs and after evaluation of proposals, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 20.18 lakh candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 3,050 Cr. for FY 2016-20. However, due to slow performance of States/UTs and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalised to Rs. 2,419 crore (approx.) with the corresponding physical target of 12.45 lakh. As on 11.11.2019, Rs. 808.96 Cr. (approx) has been disbursed to 36 States/UTs.AnnexureThe State-wise details of candidates trained and number of TCs (STT) under PMKVY 2016-20, as on 11.11.2019, is given below:S.
