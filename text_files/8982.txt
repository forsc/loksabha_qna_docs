In India norms for exposure limit for the Radio Frequency Field (Base Station Emissions) have been fixed ten times more stringent than the safe limits prescribed by International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). The instructions to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in this regard have been issued on 30.12.2011. As per these instructions the exposure limit for the Radio Frequency Field (Base Station Emissions) has been fixed as:<pre>	Frequency Range	E-Field Strength   (Volt/Meter)	H-Field Strength (Amp/Meter)	Power Density (Watt/Sq.Meter)400MHz  to 2000MHz	0.434f ½	0.0011f ½	f/20002GHz to 300GHz	19.29	0.05	1 </pre> (f is frequency in MHz)Government of India has put in place a well-structured process and mechanism so that Telecommunications Service Providers strictly adhere to these prescribed norms including submission of self-certificate by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) before commercial start of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) site and extensive audit of compliance of self-certificates & BTSs. Field units of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) impose financial penalty on defaulting Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) whose BTSs are found exceeding the prescribed EMF emission limits. In addition, emission levels for these BTSs have also been brought within prescribed limits.
