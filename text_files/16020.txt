ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) There are 24,483 LPG distributorship across the country as on 01.02.2020. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-I.(b) to (d) Oil Marketing Companies have received 392 established cases of unaccounted sale of LPG cylinders during the last three years and the current year (April-December, 2019). State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-II. In all established cases of irregularities by LPG distributorships, refill supplies, action is taken as per provisions of Marketing Discipline Guidelines/distributorship agreement. Further, OMCs carry out surprise inspections at distributor’s premises, conduct refill audits, surprise check at customer’s premises, en-route checking of delivery vehicles etc. to prevent the diversion of domestic LPG.Indigenous production of LPG is less than demand, hence OMCs import LPG to meet the deficit to maintain smooth supply of LPG in the country. Further, OMCs take several steps including planning/construction of new refineries/augmentation of existing refineries to increase the indigenous production of LPG in the country.
