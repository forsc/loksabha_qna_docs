                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b)	The Central Pollution Control Board has awarded a study to The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI). The objective of the study is to quantify the adverse effect of poor air quality due to crop burning, in close proximity to residential areas, on respiratory health.  Another study has been awarded to National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) & Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay with an objective to understand the reasons of air quality degradation in Delhi with focus on transport of pollutants, mainly particulate matter from the agricultural stubble burning in the States of Haryana and Punjab, using measurements, modeling and satellite information.(c)     As per, SAFAR portal (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) the stubble burning was estimated to have contributed to the pollution levels between 2% to 44% for PM2.5 levels in Delhi during October- November 2019. However, the estimated contribution was30% more only for 3 days during the period. (d) & (e) In order to control stubble burning, Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ is being administered by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, with outgo of Central funds of Rs. 1178.47 crore during 2018-2020.  This scheme is to continue in 2020-21, with a tentative budgetary provision of Rs. 600 crores (100% Central grants). Further, the Government of Punjab has a scheme for providing compensation @ Rs. 100/-per quintal to those small and marginal farmers who cultivated non-basmati paddy and  managed the paddy residue in-situ without burning. The Government of Haryana scheme provide Rs. 1000/-per acre operational charges for crop residue management for in-situ and ex-situ purposes. In addition, the Government of Haryana has provided Rs. 100 per quintal incentive to those farmers who sold their paddy between 06.11.2019 to 15.11.2019 and did not burn the crop residue. The Governments of Punjab and Haryana have paid Rs 22.45 crore and Rs3.02 crore, respectively to farmers in Punjab and Haryana. A reduction of about 18.8% and 31% in active fire incidents in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been recorded in 2019 over the figures for 2018 and 2017, respectively. *****
