Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, Kolkata.(c) & (d): The details of CAT-III trained pilots are not available in the Ministry. However, presently Air India, SpiceJet, Indigo, Go Air, Air Asia and Vistara have CAT-III trained pilots. ;;(e): There is already in place Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section 3-Air Transport, Series M, Part IV titled as "Facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to denied boarding, cancellation of flights and delays in flights" issued by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The CAR provides for compensation/facilitation for the passengers affected by delay in domestic flights.
