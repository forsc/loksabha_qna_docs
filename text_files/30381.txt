                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d) :	The States meet their electricity demand from their own generating stations, share from central generating stations, and purchase from private generating stations and power exchanges.  During October 2021, the energy not served in the country was just 1.1% of energy requirement much less than the energy deficit of 11.6% in the month of November 2011. In the State of Punjab, during October, 2021, the energy not served was only 2.5% of energy requirement which was much less than the highest energy deficit of 11.3% during July, 2012. During October, 2021, due to less coal stocks in some power plants there was reduction in availability of power for a few days. The situation has quickly improved and as on day, there is no energy deficit in the country.  As on 31.10.2021, number of power plants having coal stock of less than four days was 44. However, with the consistent and concerted efforts of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Railways and Coal India Limited/Singareni Collieries Company Limited, the stock at the plants has been improving continuously and, as on 05.12.2021, the coal stock in power plants has improved to 21 Million Tonne which is sufficient for 10 days.(e) :		The month-wise details of coal stock available with the Central and State-run thermal power plants and quantum of coal required to be maintained during the last three years and the current year (Apr to Nov’2021) are given at Annexure.(f) :		The Government has taken the following measures to increase the coal supply to power plants:(i)	To address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group comprising of representatives from Ministries of Power, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) meet regularly to take operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including to alleviate critical coal stock position in power plants.(ii)	Ministry of Power has constituted a Core Management Team (CMT) with members from MoP, Railways, CEA, CIL, NTPC, DVC and POSOCO to ensure close monitoring of coal stocks at thermal power plants (TPPs) and operational decisions are being taken in CMT to augment supply of sufficient quantity of coal to the TPPs.(iii)	To help the power plants in enhancing their coal stock, CIL in October 2021 has offered about 5.2 Million Tonnes coal from its various subsidiaries to State/Central Gencos for lifting through RCR/ Road mode.(iv)	Government has issued the revised coal stocking norms which mandates the power plants to maintain sufficient stock at all times to meet any contingent situation.   **************
