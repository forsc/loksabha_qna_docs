ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under the Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore youth under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country in a four years period i.e. 2016-2020. Under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 17.01.2020, 73.47 lakh (appx.) (40.27 lakh STT + 33.20 lakh RPL) candidates have been trained/oriented throughout the country. The State/UT-wise number of candidates trained / oriented including State of Telangana under PMKVY (2016-20) is given at Annexure.(b)	Under PMKVY 2016-20, focus on employment has been significantly enhanced and candidates have been placed in various sectors and industries. Some of the provisions and initiatives are given below:•	TCs/TPs are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates.•	TPs are mandated to organize Placement / Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry.•	The reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate.•	With a focus on retention of placed candidates, TPs are given an incentive (INR 3000 – INR 5000 per trainee) if a candidate is retained in employment for a period of 12 months.•	Post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special groups and special areas for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate.•	Re-allocation of targets to TPs is based on placement achievements of previous allocated targets.•	Target allocation for FY 2019-20 includes employer-led models via RFP mode to ensure participation of employers which assure at least 50% captive employment, amongst other mandates.(c)	Under PMKVY (2016-20), there are various provisions for monitoring of TCs as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrollment-training-assessment-certification-placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill Development Management System (SDMS) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. Empanelled TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, social media etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process.
