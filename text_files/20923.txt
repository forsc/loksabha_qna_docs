In addition, the candidates oriented and certified in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of PMKVY 2.0 is also given at Annexure I.             Further, based on the learning of PMKVY 2.0, Ministry has formulated the third version of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 to further improve the standardized skilling ecosystem in the country. PMKVY 3.0 was launched on 15.01.2021. The State-wise number of empanelled training providers and candidates enrolled under Short Term Training component of PMKVY 3.0 is given at Annexure II. (c)        Under PMKVY 2.0, there are various provisions for monitoring of Training Centres (TC) as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrollment-training-assessment-certification-placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill India Portal (SIP) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. Empanelled TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process.             Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. All empanelled training centre should be operated under the umbrella of DSC. (d)       As per extant guidelines of PMKVY, 25% of the total target is allocated for States/UTs and remaining 75% for central component. (e)       The FY-wise targets and corresponding achievement thereupon under PMKVY 2.0 is given below: [Figures in Lakhs]FY	Fresh Training (STT)*	Certification under RPL*	Physical Targets 	Targets Achieved / Trained	Physical Targets 	Targets Achieved / Oriented2016-17	15	0.5	10	1.732017-18	15	16.25	10	5.302018-19	15	11.02	10	9.942019-20	15	14.23	10	32.142020-21	--	4.27	--	11.57Total	60	46.27	40	60.68 * Based on the recommendations of Steering Committee of PMKVY2.0, the targets have been revised as 50.82 lakh for STT and 67.92 lakh for RPL.
