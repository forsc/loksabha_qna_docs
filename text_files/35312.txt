ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Water being a State subject, it is the responsibility of States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluent before discharging into recipient water bodies or land for prevention and control of pollution therein.  Government of India supplements efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance in abatement of pollution including protection of water resources in the country through various central sector schemes for development of infrastructure for environmentally sound management of generated municipal sewage, industrial effluent and wastes apart from specific schemes such as National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for rejuvenation of polluted rivers, National Lake Conservation Plan for restoration of stagnant water bodies, National Wetlands Conservation Programme (NWCP), AMRUT.  Government of India (GoI), with an aim to prevent water pollution, promulgated Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and various Acts under the umbrella act called ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  As per the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) in the States or Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in Union Territories, monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions empowered under these Acts. Further, as per the information received from SPCBs/PCCs (including Tamil Nadu SPCB), there are 2,839 Grossly Polluting Industries in the country. Out of these 2,839 industries, 2,186 industries are operational and 653 industries are self-closed. Number of complying and non-complying units are 2,055 and 131 respectively. Show cause notices have been issued to 55 units and closure directions have been issued to 56 units for non-compliance. State-wise status of GPI units in the country is at Annexure-I.  (c) & (d)  Assessment with regard to the quantum of water being rendered unfit for use every year due to industrial pollution is not carried out by CPCB. However, based on water quality monitoring carried out under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP), considering Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) as criteria pollutant, in the year 2018, CPCB identified 351 polluted river stretches on 323 rivers on basis of two years’ data of 2016 & 2017 (Annexure – II).  ****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) AND (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2534 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2022 REGARDING “CONSERVATION OF WATER RESOURCES”.Compliance Status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) SPCB/PCC	Total no. of industries	No. of industries closed  by their own	No. of industries operational	No. of industries complying with environmental standards 	No. of industries non-complying with environmental standards 	No. of industries against which action is  taken for non-complying with environmental standards						Show cause notice issued	Closure directions issued	Legal cases filed	Action under processAndaman & Nicobar 	2	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0Andhra Pradesh	66	11	55	50	5	2	1	0	2Arunachal Pradesh	97	8	89	63	26	3	23	0	0Assam	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Bihar	84	34	50	50	0	0	0	0	0Chandigarh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Chhattisgarh	2	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Delhi	3	0	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Goa	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Gujarat	25	1	24	20	4	3	0	0	1Haryana	627	27	600	594	6	0	6	0	0Himachal Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Jammu & Kashmir	69	0	69	66	3	3	0	0	0Jharkhand	45	6	39	5	34	14	10	2	8Karnataka 	4	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0Kerala 	29	1	28	27	1	0	1	0	0Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Madhya Pradesh	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Maharashtra	4	1	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Manipur	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Meghalaya	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Mizoram	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Nagaland	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Odisha	6	0	6	6	0	0	0	0	0Puducherry	3	0	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Punjab	5	0	5	4	1	1	0	0	0Rajasthan	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0Sikkim	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Tamil Nadu	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Telangana	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Tripura 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Uttar Pradesh	1,648	560	1,088	1,047	41	22	13	0	6Uttarakhand	64	0	64	60	4	4	0	0	0West Bengal	48	3	45	41	4	3	0	0	1Total	2,839	653	2,186	2,055	131	55	56	2	18  ANNEXURE-IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (c) AND (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2534 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2022 REGARDING “CONSERVATION OF WATER RESOURCES”.
