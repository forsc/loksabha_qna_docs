ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1828 BY SHRI KODIKUNNIL SURESH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 08.12.2021 REGARDING RENOVATION/MODERNISATION OF MADURAI DIVISION(a) and (b) Kottarakara and Kundara are NSG6 category railway stations. These stations were identified for development under Adarsh Station Scheme and have been developed under the scheme accordingly. All the minimum essential amenities as per Railway norms are available at these stations. Ezhukone and Kuri (Halt) are NSG6 and HG2 category railway stations respectively on Tenkasi-Kollam section of Madurai division. All the minimum essential amenities as per Railway norms are available at these stations. Avaneeshwaram is an NSG6 category railway station on Tenkasi-Kollam section of Madurai division. All the minimum essential amenities except a foot over bridge (FOB) are available at the station as per Railway norms. The work for provision of FOB at a cost of ` 1.00 crore at Avaneeshwaram station is in progress and the same is targeted for completion in Financial Year 2021-22. Further, upgradation/ modernization of stations on Indian Railways is a continuous and on-going process and works in this regard are undertaken as per requirement, subject to inter-se priority and availability of funds. However, priority for upgradation / modernization of stations is accorded to higher category of station over lower category of station while sanctioning and executing the work.(c) and (d) Electrification work on Kollam – Punalur section is in progress at full swing and is in different stages of execution. The completion of electrification project depends upon various factors like clearances from the concerned Departments/State Governments/Central Ministries, completion of Transmission Line works by State Power Utilities and resolution of law & order issues during execution, which are beyond the control of Ministry of Railways. Therefore it is not feasible to fix time lines for completion of project. Budget allocation of ` 19.29 crore has been kept for this project during 2021-22; out of which, expenditure of ` 7.0 crore has been incurred up to October, 2021.******
