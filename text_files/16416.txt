ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) :	Three proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) at Suryapet, Asifabad and Narsampet in Telangana were received from the District Collectors concerned.  However, as per the existing norms prescribed for opening of new KVs, for State sponsored KVs under the Civil Sector, the proposals have to be submitted by the State Governments (instead of from District Collectors) to the concerned Regional Office of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS).  This position has been conveyed to the concerned District Collectors by KVS. No such proposal for opening of new KVs, in the prescribed proforma, duly recommended by the State Government of Telangana has been received so far.	Proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.  As such no time frame can be given as to when such proposals are likely to be accepted. (c ) to (e):	 Till the financial year 2019-20, there was combined budget allocation for two schemes : (i) the Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students (CSSS) and (ii) Special Scholarship Scheme for Jammu & Kashmir. From the financial year 2020-21, separate budget allocation has been made for both the schemes and Rs. 140 crore has been allocated for the Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students. Details of the funds allocated and released during the last three years are as under:<pre> (Rs. in crore) Financial year	Total Fund Allocated	Expenditure under CSSS	Scholarship amount released to Telangana2017-18	318.0	143.33	14.382018-19	339.0	129.44	6.872019-20	380.0	161.60	12.03</pre> *****
