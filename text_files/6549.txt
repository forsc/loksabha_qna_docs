Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), on receipt of Memorandum from State Governments and in accordance with extant norms and procedures.

Further, Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), claims are provided to insured farmers for notified crops against the shortfall in yield due to adverse climatic conditions as per the formula envisaged in operational guidelines of the scheme.(f)	The Government of India has evolved several schemes/programmes to improve the condition of farmers namely Soil Health Card (SHC), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), National Agriculture Market Scheme (e-NAM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) etc.    	Besides, Government of India has prepared crop contingency plan for 650 districts in the country to sustain agriculture production in the eventuality of any sudden change in weather.
