ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (f) : The number of jewelers who got themselves registered for hallmarking as on 30 November 2021 is1,26,373 and the number of pieces of jewellery that have been hallmarked since the implementation of mandatory hallmarking of gold ornaments (from 01 July 2021 - 30 November 2021)is 4.29 Crore.Hallmarking had been made mandatory from January15, 2021. However, in view of the pandemic situation, the date was extended to June 1, 2021. Thereafter, there were detailed stakeholders’ consultations with representatives from jewellery manufacturers, exporters, wholesalers, retailers, AHCs, consumer organizations etc. Taking into account the ground situation, Hallmarking has been made mandatory from June 23, 2021 for 14, 18, & 22 carat of gold jewellery/artefacts in 256 districts of the country where there is at least one Assaying and Hallmarking Centre (AHC).An advisory committee, which also included representatives of jewellers and AHCs, has been constituted by the Government to deal with the issues faced in the implementation of mandatory hallmarking. Some of the genuine concerns addressed by the Government interalia include the following: Jeweller registration has been made free and valid for lifetime; Jewellers having turnover less than Rs.40 lakhs have been exempted from mandatory hallmarking; Polki, jadaau and kundanjewellery have been exempted from mandatory hallmarking; Indian standard for Hallmarking was amended to provide for the hallmarking of 20, 23 and 24 carats of gold jewellery; Indian Standard has also been amended to provide for hallmarking of mixed lot of jewellery; Hallmarking Unique ID (HUID) based system has been introduced to ensure greater transparency in the functioning of the gold jewellery industry and for providing credibility of hallmark to the consumers. Further, the software has been made user-friendly and a Help Desk has been set up at BIS Headquarters and also at all BIS Branch Offices, to resolve the issues and problems of the jewellers and AHCs.*****
