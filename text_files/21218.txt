                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) and (b).   India is participating in the fisheries subsidies negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in accordance with the mandate of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG)-14.6 and the WTO Ministerial Conference (MC)-11. As per the mandate, Members have agreed to engage constructively in the fisheries subsidies negotiations, with a view to adopting an agreement on comprehensive and effective disciplines that prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, and eliminate subsidies that contribute to Illegal, Unreported & Unregulated (IUU) fishing. The mandate also provides that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing country Members and least developed country Members should be an integral part of these negotiations. Aquaculture and inland fisheries are excluded from the scope of the negotiations.(c)	 The Government of India through its schemes and programs provides assistance (subsidies) to artisanal fishermen. Towards this end, during the past five years (2015-16 to 2019-20) the Centrally Sponsored Scheme-“Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries” has been implemented at an outlay of Rs 3000 Crores. From the current year (2020-21) onwards, the Government of India has substantially increased investments in the fisheries sector through a new flagship scheme namely “Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with an estimated investment of Rs 20050 crores over five years. With the highest ever investment of Rs 20050 crores in fisheries sector, the PMMSY inter alia, provides assistance (subsidies) to artisanal fishermen. With the implementation of PMMSY there has been an overall increase in the total assistance (subsidies) for artisanal fishermen.***
