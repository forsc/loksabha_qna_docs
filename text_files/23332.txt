ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	The New Farm laws viz, “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” and “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020,  are intended to facilitate direct buying from farmers in trade area by traders, processors, exporters, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agriculture co-operative Societies etc., so as to facilitate farmers with better price realization. Farm laws will accelerate more investment in marketing and value addition infrastructure including that in storage facilities near to farm gate creating more employment opportunities for rural youth. 	Farm laws provide additional marketing opportunities to farmers for selling their produce outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market yards such as at farm-gates, cold storages, warehouse, silos, etc. to help farmers to sell their produce to direct buyers without depending on middlemen thus reducing cost of marketing and improving their gain. “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020” is also intended to promote competition and transparency in trade by way of facilitation of electronic trading system in trade area thus helping farmers specially small and marginal farmers in improving their income. This will also encourage APMC markets to be more competitive and efficient in providing cost effective services to the benefit of farmers. 	The new farm laws also provide farmers with cost effective, easy time bound dispute resolution system at local level with provision of penalty against traders for contravention of any provision to protect the farmers including small and marginal farmers. Therefore, new farm laws are truly in the interest and benefit of farmers including that of small and marginal farmers to ensure their prosperity and dignity and prevent dependence on middlemen. The traders  one the other hand including small businessmen under new farm law of “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020” are free to buy in trade area so far as they comply to provisions of the new farm law. 	Since 2014, the Govt. has been implementing various innovative schemes like Kisan Credit Cards, Soil Health Cards, e-NAM and effective crop insurance scheme towards favorable environment to create opportunities for farmers. 	Amongst the steps taken, the Govt. of India is implementing Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) for welfare of farmers which is available for availing short term agri loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh to farmers at an interest rate of 7% per annum for one year. The short term agri loans include crop Husbandry, Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. Additional 3% subvention is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans; the same gets reduced to 4% per annum. This also ensures their prosperity and dignity and prevents dependence on middlemen. The benefits of ISS have also been extended to farmers in allied activities like Animal Husbandry and Fisheries to existing Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holders within the overall limit of Rs.3.00 lakh and issue of new KCC for Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers with provision of benefit of IS &PRI for loan amount upto Rs.2.00 lakh per annum. To bring the maximum number of farmers under KCC in order to provide easy access to concessional institutional credit, Government has taken various initiatives viz. waiving off all kinds of service charges like processing fee, inspection, ledger folio charges for loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh, raising collateral free loan limit for short term agri-credit from Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh and extending benefit of KCC to the farmers practicing Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. There is no state-wise allocation/release under the ISS. However, details of funds released under ISS for the last four years [2016-17 to 2019-20] is Rs.54,157.27Cr and for the current year 2020-21 is Rs.16826.19Cr.  The total number of operative KCC accounts statewise and agency wise is given at Annexure-I.
