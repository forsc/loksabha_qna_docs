                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c): 	The Ministry of Women & Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme, named Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme), for supporting the children in difficult circumstances, as envisaged under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act). The primary responsibility of execution of the Act and implementation of the Scheme lies with the States/UTs. The scheme is being implemented as per the Cabinet approved CPS guidelines. Central Government is  sharing 60% and State is sharing 40% of expenditure (except in North Eastern and Himalayan States and UTs without legislature, where Central Government is sharing 90% and 100% of expenditure respectively) of staff salary/honorarium as per scheme guidelines. Although the Scheme provides for the hiring of contractual staff at the State and District level, the States may appoint the staff on a permanent basis or on higher salaries than provided in this scheme for which the States will have to bear the extra expenditure incurred in this regard. The details of salary structure under CPS Scheme is given in the Scheme guidelines which are available on the Ministry''s website i.e. www.wcd.nic.in.Anganwadi Services under Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Schemes envisages the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) & Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as "honorary workers" from the local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development.

The Government has, recently, enhanced honorarium of AWWs from Rs.3,000/- to    Rs.4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from Rs.2,250/- to Rs.3,500/- per month; AWHs from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.2,250/- per month. The Government has also introduced performance linked incentive of Rs.250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1st October, 2018. AWWs are paid performance linked incentive of Rs.500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. Most of the States/UTs are also giving monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources.Under Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) Scheme, there is provision for engagement of 05 consultants under State Resource Centre for Women (SRCW) at the state level and 03 Consultants for District Resource Centre for Women (DLCW) at the district level.
