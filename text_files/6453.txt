ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) to (c) At present, there is no proposal for conversion of Patna University into Central University.There are already three Central Universities functioning in the State of Bihar at Gaya, Motihari andNalanda. However, the State Government is yet to hand over possession of land for the CentralUniversity at Motihari. Besides, the Prime Minister package for Bihar also proposes to establish anew Central University near Bhagalpur at the historic site of Vikramshila University. As a policydecision, this Ministry avoids conversion of any university into Central University for reasons oflegacy issues, adjustment of existing staffs and disaffiliation of affiliated colleges.As per the 12th Plan (2012-17), as approved by the National Development Council, the thrust is onconsolidation of the higher education system and expansion is to be mainly done by scaling upcapacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. Further, ‘Education’being a concurrent subject, the State Government may also take initiative for establishing newuniversities.*****
