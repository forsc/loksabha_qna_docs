                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b) With a view to provide additional connectivity for Chandigarh, Indian Railways have extended 14629/30 Firozpur-Ludhiana Express up to Chandigarh. It has also been decided to operate 12715/16 Huzur Sahib Nanded-Amritsar Sachkhand Express, 18309/10 Sambalpur-Jammu Tawi Express and 14609/10 Rishikesh-Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra Hemkunt Express via Chandigarh.  In view of the prevailing situation, at present, these trains are operating via Chandigarh as special trains, benefitting a total of 42252 reserved passengers, till the end of February, 2021. However, since the unreserved tickets are not train specific, it is not feasible to provide details of the number of unreserved passengers who benefitted by travelling in these trains.  *****
