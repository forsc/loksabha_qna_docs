There has been a decline in population of Great Indian Bustard due to combination of anthropogenic factors, such as historical hunting, conversion of its habitat, grasslands to intensive agriculture, and emerging threats like mortality due to collision/ electrocution with the power lines in its habitat and nest/predation by dogs and other predators in its breeding sites. As per the estimation of Wildlife Institute of India, the current population of Great Indian Bustard is estimated to be about 130-150 birds with the majority of the population in Jaisalmer Rajasthan at about 120 birds, Gujarat with 6 female birds, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka combined about 15-25 birds.   (c)	Steps taken/being taken by the Government for conservation of Great Indian Bustards are as given below:i.	The Great Indian Bustard is listed in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, thereby, according them highest degree of legal protection from hunting.ii.

The Ministry with financial support from National Authority for Compensatory Afforestation Funds has sanctioned an outlay of Rs. 33.85 crores for the duration of five years for the programme titled ‘Habitat Improvement and Conservation Breeding of Great Indian Bustard-an integrated approach’. The important objective of this programme is to build up captive population of Great Indian Bustard and to release the chicks in the wild for increasing the population and also to promote in-situ conservation of the species.v.	In consultation with State Government, Wildlife Institute of India and international experts, a site for establishment of Conservation breeding Centre has been identified in Kota District, Rajasthan under the above mentioned project.
