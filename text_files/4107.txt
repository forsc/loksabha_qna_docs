All activities of implementation of scheme from identification of beneficiaries till completion of houses are done through MIS-AwaasSoft. iii.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each pre-determined stage of house construction through the mobile application- AwaasApp. This has helped in reduction of time in verification of house construction enabling  faster release of assistance leading to timely house completion.iv.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason by implementing ''on the job'' Rural Mason Training Programme which has helped in construction of quality houses at a faster pace.v.	Assigning each house sanctioned under PMAY-G to a local functionary to improve monitoring and facilitate timely construction of houses.vi.
