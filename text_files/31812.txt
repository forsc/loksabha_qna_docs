This comprehensive online system provides a platform to the pharmaceutical manufacturer/ marketing/ importer/ distributor companies to file mandatory returns prescribed under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). The application for price approval of ‘new drug’ in Form–I of DPCO, 2013 can also be filed through this portal. The portal provides industry with a user-friendly mechanism to comply with the mandatory requirement of filing returns and also help NPPA to monitor price compliance. As on 30th November, 2021, about 975 pharma companies have registered themselves under IPDMS and have registered 86,822 products.  *****
