ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	Delivery norms for various categories of mail viz. Speed Post, Registered Post, Unregistered letters/parcels, Business Parcels etc. have been laid down in the Citizen Charter, which are revised from time to time. Continuous efforts are being made by the Department to ensure compliance of delivery of mail with the prescribed norms in the Citizen Charter. Occasional delay, however, in delivery of mail is contributed by factors beyond the control of the Department viz. dependence of the Department on external agencies such as Airlines, Railways and Road Transport Corporations, for transmission of mail, incorrect or incomplete address provided by the customers, non-use of Pincode, wrong Pincode, non-availability of the addressee, change in the residence of the addressee without information to the concerned Post Office, natural calamity etc.Conformity of accountable mail viz. Speed Post (including parcels) and Registered Post (including parcels) and Business Parcels to the prescribed delivery norms is monitored through a performance dashboard under which various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are regularly evaluated. As a part of the monitoring mechanism, monthly video conferences are held with the field units for evaluation of end to end mail operations including delivery at the post office level.  Delivery and transmission of unregistered/ordinary mail is monitored through posting of test letters and regular visits to mail offices and delivery post offices. Barcodes for ordinary mail bags have been introduced for bag level tracking as a measure of improvement in transmission.  Direct available flights are being used from one mail processing hub to another to ensure expedited transmission and delivery of all categories of mail. Further, Nodal Mechanized Delivery Centres (NDCs) have been operationalised in the country for mechanized delivery of Speed Post parcels. Department has also set up semi-automated parcel centres enabling mechanized sorting of parcels (including Speed Post parcels) to expedite processing and delivery. (b)	Does not arise in view of above.(c)	Bringing improvement in the quality of mail delivery is a continuous activity. Apart from the steps taken by the Department as mentioned in (a) above, Department has also restructured the operational network for various categories of mail as part of Mail Network Optimization Project (MNOP). Under MNOP, the Department has optimized the network for Speed Post, Registered and unregistered mail to ensure faster processing, transmission and delivery. Recently, Parcel Network of the Department has also been optimized as part of Parcel Network Optimisation Project (PNOP) with the aim of improving processing, transmission and delivery of parcels..  ************
