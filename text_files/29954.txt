The said GLP Project is aimed in assisting participating developing countries to prevent and reduce marine plastic litter from the maritime transport as well as fisheries sectors, and identifying opportunities for the reduction of plastic uses in both industries. Under GLP, a draft National Action Plan has been prepared by Government of India to prevent and reduce the Marine Plastic Litter (MPL) and in particular Sea-based Marine Plastic Litter to reverse the negative environmental impacts of plastic discard and loss. In addition, Department of Fisheries, Government of India, also intends to create awareness regarding plastic marine pollution under its scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana.(d)	Does not arise.*****
