                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Details of State/Union Territory wise percentage of beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA) in the country is at Annexure – I. District wise data is not maintained by Government of India. (b):  	Details of year-wise funds allocated and released since 2014 under Food Subsidy to FCI, Food Subsidy to Decentralized Procurement (DCP) States and Central assistance for expenditure incurred towards intra-State transportation and handling & Fair Price Shop dealers margin is at Annexure-II. (c) & (d): 	The exercise of State-wise coverage within the overall national coverage under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) was done by the erstwhile Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) using the 68th round of National Sample Survey Organization Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2011-12). A State-wise cut off level of monthly expenditure was arrived at separately for rural and urban areas and population below this cut off monthly expenditure was eligible for coverage under the Act. The methodology of Planning Commission was such that the percentage coverage under NFSA was not uniform across all States/Union Territories. Coverage was higher for those States/Union Territories, where the size of the population below the cut off level of expenditure was relatively large in proportion to their total population vis-à-vis those states where the proportion was smaller. Therefore, the coverage of some States like Maharashtra was lower vis-à-vis those States that had a higher poverty ratio as compared to Maharashtra.(e) & (f): 	 As per Section 9 of the National Food Security Act, 2013 the total number of persons to be covered in rural and urban areas of the State shall be calculated on the basis of the population estimates as per the census of which the relevant figures have been published. Census 2021 is not yet published.****Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1736 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 08.12.2021 REGARDING “HOUSEHOLD COVERED UNDER FSS”.Statement indicating State-Wise number of Persons/families Covered under National Food Security Act, 2013   As on 30.11.2021                    Sl.
