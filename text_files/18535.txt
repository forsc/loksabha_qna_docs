                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)     National Biomaterial Centre has been established at National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, an organisation under Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and is fully functional. (b)   The Government of India is implementing National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP) to promote organ donation across the country. Under this programme, an apex level National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) at New Delhi and Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) at Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati have been set up. Further, State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) have been established in  twelve States. The Government  has taken several steps for promoting organ donation  through  various means of communication viz, setting up a website of NOTTO, (www.notto.gov.in)  which contains information on awareness and other activities relating to organ donation and a 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number 1800114770. Besides NOTTO, ‘Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (ROTTOs)’ and ‘State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (SOTTOs)’also carry out Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day, seminars, workshops, debates, poster competitions, walkathons, organ donation pledging campaigns, putting up display boards outside Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and other strategic locations in the transplant/retrieval hospitals etc.Such activities are organized in different places in the country to disseminate information and increase awareness on organ donation. Awareness messages are also disseminated through audio visuals, print and social media from time to time by the aforesaid organisations.(c)  There is no such proposal to set up National Human Organ Donation Bank as organs like Heart, Kidney, etc. need to be transplanted immediately after retrieval. However, the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) has a facility of National Level Tissue Bank (Biomaterial Centre) for storing tissues. Under the National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP), a provision has been made for providing financial support to the States for setting up of Bio- material centre. As of now a Regional Bio-material centre has been established at Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO), Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Further, funds have been released to the State of Bihar and Maharashtra for establishment of Bio-material Centre under NOTP.(d)   While, no such proposal is under consideration of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare at present, the Government is making all possible efforts to enhance awareness amongst all sections of society including school children and college students about the importance of organ donation. A number of activities are organized for school and college students every year by NOTTO/ROTTOs and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (SOTTOs).
