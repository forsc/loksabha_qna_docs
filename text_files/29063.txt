ANSWER




(a)      The number of functional crèches in the country under the ''National Creche Scheme for Children of Working Mothers'' of the Ministry of Women and Child Development during the last three years, that is, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 was 18040, 8018 and 6458 respectively. Crèches have not been functional under this scheme since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic for preventing spread of Covid-19.   (b) to (d)  The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 requires every establishment having fifty or more employees to have the facility of crèche within a prescribed distance. The State Governments, who are the appropriate Government under the Maternity Benefit Act for establishments other than mines and circus, are required to frame rules for the purposes of the Act, including inter alia for prescribing amenities and facilities required to be provided in such creches, in light of which the Ministry of Labour and Employment has already requested all State Governments. Besides, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) of the Government of India, through its registered society for welfare of government employees and their family dependents, has been running creches/ day care centres.  DoPT has also issued guidelines to all Ministries/ Departments regarding opening of creches/day care centres in office premises for women employees. (e)        Yes Sir.*****
