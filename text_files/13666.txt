ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)  FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS  { SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }  (a) Funds are allocated by this Ministry Scheme-wise, not State-wise. The details of the funds allocated and expenditure incurred under various sports schemes for sports infrastructure facilities and promotion of sports in country, including rural areas, during the last three years and the current year are given at Annexure.  (b) No, Sir.  (c) Yes, Sir. Elite athletes preparing for international competitions are provided with international standard State-of-the-art sports equipment and infrastructure besides services of Indian and foreign coaches and support staff as per specific requirement of the individual/team. Sports Authority of India (SAI) Headquarter provides good quality products/items to the Regional Centres across the country for training of players and National Campers. Special emphasis is given to procure best sporting goods/items available in the market as per specifications recommended by International Sports Federations. The sporting goods/items are procured as per the laid down procedure and as per demand received from elite players and National Sports Federations.  Further, under the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF) and Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) athletes are provided financial assistance to acquire modern sports equipment as per their choice to promote excellence in sports.  (d) Yes, Sir. Under the Scheme of Assistance to National Sports Federations, the identified promising athletes/teams are provided preparatory training at the National Coaching Camps, including wholesome nutritious diet, food supplements, equipments, state-of-the-art infrastructure, lodging, travelling facilities, services of reputed Indian and foreign coaches/supporting staff, scientific & medical support, sports kit, etc., besides financial assistance for their training abroad and participation in international competitions in India and abroad.  (e) No, Sir. Sports being a State subject, the primarily responsibility to undertake any study to assess deficiencies in sports infrastructure and the steps taken to correct them and improve India’s performance in international events rests with the respective State/Union Territory Governments. The Union Government only supplements the efforts of States/Union Territory Governments by providing financial assistance through its various schemes. Sports infrastructure available under this Ministry can cater to larger number of athletes.
