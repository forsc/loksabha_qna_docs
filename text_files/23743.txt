                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a & b) Yes, Sir. In view of the good potential for export of organic agricultural products in the international market, Ministry of Commerce & Industry initiated development of the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP). NPOP became operational on 1st December 2001 after being notified by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade under The Foreign Trade (Development & Regulations) Act,1992. NPOP has since been revised from time to time. 7th edition of NPOP was notified by DGFT on 1st June 2015.The aims of the NPOP, inter alia, include the following:a)	To provide the means of evaluation of certification programme for organic agriculture and products (including wild harvest, aquaculture, livestock products) as per the approved criteria.b)	To accredit certification programmes of Certification Bodies seeking accreditation.c)	To facilitate certification of organic products in conformity with the prescribed standards.d)	To facilitate certification of organic products in conformity with the importing countries organic standards as per equivalence agreement between the two countries or as per importing country requirements.e)	To encourage the development of organic farming and organic processing.The National Steering Committee (NSC), is the apex body for implementation of the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP). The National Accreditation Body (NAB), constituted by the NSC, is responsible for accreditation of certification bodies and on relevant issues pertaining to the accreditation policies and procedures. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) has been designated as the secretariat to service NSC and NAB for implementation of NPOP.In terms of NPOP, an accredited Certification Body has to certify a product as organic for it to be exported. Such Certification Bodies conduct detailed inspection of the operators (farmers, processors, traders, handlers or exporters) before certifying them as organic.  After inspection and successful compliance to the requirement by the certified operators, certificate is issued, having a validity of one year.Organic products are traded only through Transaction Certificates (TCs) issued by the accredited Certification Bodies, wherein the product identity and complete traceability is maintained through a web-based system (TRACENET).***********
