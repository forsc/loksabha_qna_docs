                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS.                            (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)                                                (a): Yes Sir, Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) has launched “Hisaab ki kitab” a series of 6 short films on 03.06.2021.(b): In “Hisaab ki Kitaab” series, there are 6 short films/segments. The segments cover, (i) Budget and saving through budget; (ii) Importance of Bank accounts; (iii) Government Schemes and Social Security Services; (iv) Insurance and Pension Products; (v) Using savings for investments and Points to be noted while investing; (vi) Ponzi Schemes and Capital Market. These short films are being used by IEPFA and its partnering organization viz., CSC e-Governance Services India Limited, India Post Payments Bank and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan for investor awareness programmes.Contd…2/-(c): 	IEPFA has collaborated with CSC e-Governance Services India Limited for conducting 15000 Investor Awareness Programmes (IAPs) in rural areas encompassing 117 aspirational districts of India. The customized awareness programmes for Youth through Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangthan, caters to the Investor awareness and financial literacy needs of rural and urban youths. IEPFA has collaborated with India Post Payments Bank for conducting investor awareness programmes and financial literacy camps in semi urban and peri urban areas. The Grameen Dak Sewaks (GDS) of Department of Posts are being used for door to door dissemination of messages by way of distribution of flyers etc. In order to ensure an effective preventive strategy and help citizens refrain from falling prey to Ponzi schemes, “Hisaab Ki Kitaab” series of short films has an exclusive  segment giving a message to people about the modus operandi of Ponzi schemes and their consequences. In order to alert citizens at large, IEPFA uses its Social Media account to post messages on regular intervals with Banners and infographics. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also undertakes various investor education and awareness activities and financial education programmes in rural and urban areas. During such programmes, investors are also cautioned against Ponzi and un-regulated investment schemes. SEBI also carries out mass media campaign giving relevant messages to investors through popular media (TV/ Radio/Print/bulk SMSs/Digital media/cinema). Further, to ensure that the poor people especially in urban as well as rural areas do not fall prey to Ponzi schemes, a comprehensive Central legislation, namely the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019 has been brought by the Central Government. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 37 of the Act the Central Government has also notified the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Scheme Rules, 2020, vide notification in the Gazette of India dated 12.02.2020. ********
