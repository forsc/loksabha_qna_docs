                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)  	Under Syama Prasad Mukherji RurbanMission (SPMRM), Sompeta cluster, (Srikakulam district) was allocated under Phase 2 to State of Andhra Pradesh. As per the Detailed project report (DPR) approved by State Level Empowered Committee (SLEC), total 290 works have been sanctioned for development of Sompeta cluster of State of Andhra Pradesh.   (b) 	There is no provision for State-wise allocation of funds under the Mission.  However, the funds are being released to States/UTs based on fulfillment of certain conditions as mentioned in the Mission guidelines.  Also, under the fund pooling mechanism, the funds are not released cluster-wise but are released to the States in a single nodal account.  Accordingly the total funds released to the State of Andhra Pradesh is Rs.189.00 crore as Critical Gap Fund(CGF), including Central and State share, and Rs.4.55 crore as administrative fund till date. (c) 	Out of total 290 projected works, 133 works have been completed, 110 works are ongoing and 47 works are yet to start.  (d)	 Main reasons for delay in execution of works are as follows:  (i)   Modification in DPR for some of the works.(ii)  Delay in administrative sanction of Convergence works by the concerned line departments(iii) Land issues/Legal dispute on the proposed site of construction (e) & (f)  State of Andhra Pradesh had proposed Cold Storage in Sompeta cluster, Srikakulam District in the Integrated Cluster Action Plan (ICAP) with an estimated cost of Rs. 1.00 crore in the year 2018 whose DPR was later approved by the State Level Empowered Committee. However, due to issues in ensuring proper Operation and Maintenance of the proposed asset, State of Andhra Pradesh revised the DPR and dropped the project of establishing cold storage in Sompeta cluster.   ******
