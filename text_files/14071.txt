The President, on the recommendation of the duly constituted Selection Committee, appointed the Chairperson and eight Members of the Lokpal who assumed charge of their offices on 23rd and 27th March, 2019 respectively. (b):   The Lokpal is an independent statutory body established under Section 3 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.  In terms of Section 48 of the said Act, the Lokpal is required to present annually to the President a report on the work done by it, which is caused to be laid in both the Houses of the Parliament.  Since the Lokpal was operationalized at the fag end of March, 2019, no such report has been submitted by the Lokpal. Hence, details of the cases registered and action taken thereon by the Lokpal are not available.*****
