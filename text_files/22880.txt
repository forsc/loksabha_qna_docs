ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)Ambient air quality in the country is monitored through a network of manual and continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations. The Ambient air quality trend of PM2.5 in 5 years (2015-2019) is as follows:  11 cities showed decreasing trend; 79 cities show a fluctuating trend & 9 cities showed an increasing trend. Air Quality of a city depends on multiple factors, which include meteorology, geography, local sources such as vehicles, industries, etc. and contribution from other regional sources. It is observed that meteorology plays very important role in air pollution. Especially, Northern part of India, during winters, experiences low wind speeds, low temperatures which results in limited mixing area for dilution and thus contributing towards higher pollution levels. (c)It has been reported that COVID-19 related lockdown has resulted in temporaryimprovement of air quality in many cities due to closure of industries, reduction in number of vehicles plying, lack of construction activities and absence of human activities. The details of the air quality for major cities in India is at Annexure-I.However, the improvement in air quality due to widespread restrictions on operation of major activities was an extraordinary situation and, once normality is attained, pollution levels trend, is observed in business as usual scenario.(d)As per the several studies conducted across the country the major sources of particulate matter are road dust suspension, vehicles, biomass/garbage burning, construction, industries, etc and the specific details of study is at Annexure –II.(e)Government of India launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which is very comprehensive plan to tackle air pollution problem across the country in a focussed manner to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 levels by 2024 from 2017 levels. The concerned ministries, State Governments, Research Institutes, Industries, etc. are partner in this effort. Under NCAP, a National Knowledge Network (NKN) has been constituted with a group of experts from IITs and Institutes of Repute as an advisory board for providing capacity building, State of art technologies, suggestions, advisories regarding air pollution mitigation and abatement to CPCB, SPCB and ULBS.	Further,on 15th August 2020, the Hon’ble Prime Minister also announced to improve air quality in more than 100 cities. Hon’ble Prime Minister has also launched Air Quality Index (AQI) in 2015, which provides air pollution information and health effect in simple form, which can be understood even by common persons. National Air Quality Standards are also based on health consideration. 	Government has taken several steps for mitigation of air pollution such as introduction of BS-VI, expansion of Metro, operationalization of Eastern and Western peripheral expressways, shifting of industries to PNG, waste processing plants, online round the clock monitoring of red category industries, etc. The details of initiatives taken by government to combat air pollution is at Annexure –III.	While the Government is making concerted efforts to mitigate air pollution, the citizens should also extend support for the following activities such as:•	Renew your Pollution Under Control Certificate timely.•	Avoid idling of engines.•	Plan your errands to reduce travel time and trips.•	Adopt clean modes of transport.•	Prefer cycles/ e-bikes for short trips.•	Adopt public transportation wherever feasible.•	Avoid Congested routes.Segregate household waste•	Never burn waste•	Take recyclable waste to collection centres & earn from waste too•	Compost leaves and garden waste•	Avoid vigorous sweeping of leaves in gardens/ parks – use wide rakes•	Dispose e-waste responsibly.•	Adopt green good deeds and encourage others too.•	Use public grievance redressal apps to inform air polluting activities to authorities•	 Share about ongoing clean initiatives with others***
