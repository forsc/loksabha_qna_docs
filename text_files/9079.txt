R.  TO BE ANSWERED ON 04.12.2019 IN LOK SABHA REGARDING ADVANTAGES OF PRIVATISATION(a) to (c) Indian Railways, under a pilot project, have authorized Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Railways, to operate 2(two) Tejas Train services on Lucknow-New Delhi and Ahmedabad-Mumbai sectors on haulage charge basis. Of these, the Lucknow-New Delhi Tejas has commenced service w.e.f. 04.10.2019. Ministry of Railways have also constituted a Group of Secretaries (GoS) with a term of one year inter-alia to permit private passenger train operators to operate trains with world class technology over Indian Railways network to provide improved and value-added services. As of now, the GoS has held four meetings and modalities in this regard have not been finalized.(d) No, Sir. There is no provision in Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 for automatic absorption of contract labourers after completion of contract. However, Railways as Principal Employer should ensure that the facilities by the Contractor as per the provisions for Labour Laws including the Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 and minimum wages as notified by the Central/State Government  under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 are provided. Suitable instructions have been issued to the Zonal Railways that cases of violation of these laws, if any, should be dealt with strictly in accordance with the extant provisions.(e) Railway Recruitment Boards cater to the recruitment needs of all the Zonal Railways and Production Units of Group ‘C’ staff and if mandated, can play a major human resource role in the emerging privatization.(f) In 2016, a policy decision was taken for allocating 1% cost in all sanctioned works for execution of environment related works. Sewage treatment plant is included in permissible environment related works.*****
