Contd….2/--2-(ii) The Government on 12th May, 2021 approved the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for manufacturing of Advance Chemistry Cell (ACC) in the country in order to bring down prices of battery in the country.

(iv) Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) announced that battery-operated vehicles will be given green license plates and be exempted from permit requirements. (v) Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) issued a notification advising states to waive road tax on EVs, which in turn will help reduce the initial cost of EVs.(d):	Sir, as part of Phase-II of FAME-India Scheme, there is a IEC (Information, Education & Communication) activities component.
