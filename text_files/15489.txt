(a) to (e):   The authorisation and holding of essential items including snow goggles, multi-purpose boots to the soldiers deployed in high attitude areas in Ladakh and Siachen is as per operational requirement of the Indian Army.  The acquisition of such items is undertaken as per laid down specification and authorisation, which is an ongoing process for which necessary steps are taken regularly.	Further, there has been no instance of insufficient supply  of the requisite sanctioned food for soldiers in high altitude areas in Siachen and Ladakh.  The Government has authorised special scales of rations to all troops who are deployed above 12000 feet.  The ration scales are designed based upon nutritional requirement  of a soldier as per their energy expenditure under different climatic conditions.  Soldiers are supplied with the authorised scale of rations, which caters to their nutritional requirement as well as their taste preference.*****
