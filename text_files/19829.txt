ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (d): Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance is the nodal Department for receiving the dispute notice under International Investment Agreements (IIAs). However, each such dispute is handled by the mechanism of Inter- Ministerial Group (IMG) chaired by the Secretary of the concerned administrative Department.  DEA had made a panel of law firms – domestic and international - for representing India in the international investment arbitrations or disputes in August 2017. But the concerned IMG may not restrict themselves to the panel created by DEA for selection of law firm. No operational guidelines have been issued for selection of law firms or their scope of work, each IMG decides the scope of the work depending on the facts of the case on a case-to-case basis.
