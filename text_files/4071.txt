ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) Salient features of Central Victim Compensation Fund, inter-alia, are:i.	Support and supplement existing victim compensation schemes in the States/UTs as one time grant of funds.ii.	Rs. 200 crore allocated for this scheme from Nirbhaya Fund.iii.	State/UT to use the funds to compensate victims of various crimes, especially sexual offences including rape, acid attacks, crime against children, human trafficking etc.-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3744 FOR 16.07.2019(b) & (c): The Supreme Court, vide its order dated 11.05.2018 has directed all States/UTs to modify their victim compensation scheme in terms of the scheme prepared by the National Legal Services Authority. Details on any addition or modification in their Scheme by States/UTs is not maintained centrally. (d) & (e): The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in their order dated 19th October 1994, had indicated the necessity of setting up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.  However, in their order dated 10th April 2015, in Writ Petition (Criminal), no.129/2006, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had observed that since the District Legal Service Authority is already constituted in every district and is involved in providing appropriate assistance, it may not be necessary to set up a separate Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.  They have, therefore, inter-alia directed that in case of any such compensation claim, the matter will be taken up by the District Legal Service Authority and that this body will function as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for all purposes.*****
