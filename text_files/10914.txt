                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	& (b):	The WHO report of Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter – Agency Group (MMEIG) provides global estimates of MMR.As per the WHO report of MMEIG 2017, the global MMR is estimated as 211 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births & India estimates 145 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. India accounts for 12% of the global maternal deaths.Registrar General of India gives estimates on fertility and mortality using the Sample Registration System (SRS). The SRS does not generate maternal mortality data on yearly basis. Maternal deaths being a rare event require prohibitively large sample size to provide robust estimates. In order to enhance the SRS sample size, the results are derived by pooling the three years data to yield reliable estimates of maternal mortalityAs per the report of Sample Registration System (SRS) 2015-17 released by Registrar General of India (RGI), Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India has reduced from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to 122 per 100,000 live births in 2015-17.The Maternal Mortality Ratio of Telangana has shown a steady decline from 92 in 2011-13 to 81 in 2014-16 and 76 as per SRS 2015-17.As per the RGI-SRS report titled “Maternal Mortality in India: 2001-2003 trends, causes and risk factors”, major causes of maternal deaths in the country are haemorrhage (38%), sepsis (11%), hypertensive disorders (5%), obstructed labour (5%), abortion (8%) and other Conditions (34%) , which includes anaemia.The details of the maternal mortality ratio within the country, State/UT- wise including Telangana between 2014-16 and 2015-17 is placed at Annexure
