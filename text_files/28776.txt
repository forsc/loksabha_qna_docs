                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (f) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 97* FOR 3RD DECEMBER, 2021(a) to (f) The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in India was initiated in the early 1990s and has emerged as a nationally important source of data on population, health and nutrition for India and its States. So far, five rounds of the National Family Health Survey have been conducted. The broad objectives of the NFHS are to provide high quality data on population and health indicators as well as data on emerging issues in health and family welfare; and to provide essential information that would assist policymakers and programme managers in setting benchmarks and examining progress over time in India’s health sector. Besides this, this survey provides evidence on the effectiveness of ongoing programmes implemented by Government of India. The performance of India and States/UTs on major health indicators as per the latest round of NFHS. The State/UT wise major findings is placed at Annexure-I. However, some of the major findings in respect to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu and Tripura are:•	Birth registration of children is higher than 90% in all the States except Jharkhand where it is 73.5%.•	The Total Fertility Rate of all the States have reached the replacement level of fertility (TFR 2.1) except for Jharkhand where it is 2.3 children per woman.•	Under-five Mortality Rate is more than 40 in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Tripura.•	In all the States except Jharkhand (61.7%), about or more than two-third of the currently married women age 15-49 years use any method of contraception to either delay or limit their pregnancy.•	The unmet need for family planning is below 10 percent in all the States except Jharkhand (11.5%).•	In all the States except Jharkhand (38.6%), more than half of the mothers had at least 4 ANC visits for their most recent birth in the last 5 years. In Tamil Nadu, 89.9% mothers had at least 4 ANCs for their most recent birth in the last 5 years.•	Institutional births are more than 90% in all the States except for Jharkhand (75.8%) and Tripura (89.2%).•	Full vaccination of children is more than 70% in all the States except Tripura (69.5%).•	Except for Tamil Nadu (55.1%) and Tripura (62.1%), exclusive breastfeeding of infants under age 6 months is more than 70% in all other States.•	Use of menstrual hygienic products among women age 15-24 is almost universal in Tamil Nadu (98.3%). However, in Madhya Pradesh only 60.5% young women use hygienic methods of protection during their menstrual period.The State/UT-wise and national estimates on prevalence of malnourishment, anemia and full vaccination of children as per NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 are given in the Annexure-II and Annexure-III. Information on vaccines against diarrhea are not available in NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 publication.Significant improvements over key health and family welfare indicators have been observed in subsequent rounds of NFHS. The performance of a few indicators across different rounds of NFHS is given at Annexure-IV.The details of States/UTs not covered by some of these surveys are as follows:(i) NFHS-1 (1992-93):•	Srinagar region of Jammu and Kashmir was not covered due to law and order situation at the time of fieldwork.•	Sikkim was not covered in NFHS-1 due to non-availability of information on basic parameters for sample selection. (ii) NFHS-1, 2, 3: The Union Territories except the NCT of Delhi were not covered in the first three rounds of NFHS as the objective of the survey at that time was to provide State level estimates. Further, the size of population in the UTs were very small and consisted less than one percent of the total population of India. However, since NFHS-4, all the States/UTs and Districts are being covered as the scope of the survey was widened from National level estimates to District level estimates. The five rounds of National Family Health Survey conducted so far have more or less on a similar structure to maintain the comparability of estimates across various rounds. However, additions, deletions and modifications to the questionnaire are made in subsequent rounds taking into consideration the emerging issues in health and family welfare domain of the country; and requirement of quality data for tracking the ongoing programmes and formulating new policies. The major revisions made in the format of NFHS since its inception are placed at Annexure – V.MoHFW has always been striving at strengthening quality of data in NFHS by introducing several innovative measures in collection, processing and interpretation. The following are the major steps taken by NFHS in subsequent rounds:•	Comprehensive training and Multilayer monitoring and supervision of field work.•	Minimizing instrumental errors, human errors and transcription errors in collection of biomarkers.•	Developing nested design using a modular approach adopted from NFHS-4.•	Introduction of Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI).•	Real time access to data using field check tables, for immediate feedback through online interactions since NFHS-4.•	Developing error messages in the data collected from a Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) by supervisor from NFHS-5.•	Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for generating Query Reports on selected indicators before completing any PSU to enhance data quality. •	Developing COVID-19 specific SOPs in the second phase of NFHS-5.•	Backchecks in randomly selected Households (HHs) in 10% PSUs in each district and revisits in all HHs in case of deviance in over 10% surveyed HHs in post COVID scenario.
