This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. Contd..2/-:: 2 :: 	For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Ministry of Labour & Employment has launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan Yojana launched on 05th March, 2019 which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3,000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. The unorganised workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is    Rs. 15,000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. The Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 applies to all the scheduled industries and notified class of establishments having 20 or more employees in both Organised and Unorganized sectors, including casual workers.  The casual workers are entitled to benefits as admissible under the relevant labour laws which are enforced by the respective enforcement machinery available under the central and the state sphere.
