ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	The Government is implementing the Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) which provides support for creation of world-class infrastructure facilities for setting up of textile units, with a Government of India grant upto 40% of the project cost  and Government of India grant upto 90% of the project cost for first two projects (each) in the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir; with ceiling limit of Rs. 40.00 crores for each textile park. The Scheme is a demand driven scheme. A total of 59 textile parks have been sanctioned under SITP by the Ministry of Textiles out of which 22 textile parks have been completed and rest are under various stages of construction. The detail of which is placed at Annexure I. (b):	The slow progress in implementation of the textile parks under the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks has been attributed primarily to delay in obtaining land and other statutory clearances to the parks from State Government and slow fund mobilisation by the textile parks. Regular meetings are held at senior levels in the Ministry of Textile with various stakeholders of the textile parks and State Governments representatives to resolve any issues faced by them. Regional conferences are also conducted by the Ministry of Textiles on periodic basis.(c):	Does not arise.(d) & (e):	Two textile parks have been sanctioned in the state of Uttar Pradesh so far, under the Scheme for Integrated Textile Park. The details of the same may be seen at Annexure-II.  However, no fresh proposal for setting up textile parks in state of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar under SITP is pending for consideration in Ministry of Textiles.
