                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (e).A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN PART (A) TO (E) OF THE REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.404 TO BE ANSWERED ON 22.07.2019 ASKED BY SHRI A.K.P. CHINRAJ AND SHRI SU. THIRUNAVUKKARASAR REGARDING TRAINING TO PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS(a) to (c): Yes, Sir.  In view of the need for ensuring safety and security of children in schools and for dealing with issues related to health and well being of the students, the modern day teacher and head of schools need to be equipped with the requisite skills to handle these issues. There is also a need to move away from rote learning to competency based learning, improve the numeracy and literacy skills and overall learning outcomes of students and for promoting joyful and experiential learning in an inclusive classroom environment. All these issues were discussed in various consultative meetings held with States and UTs and autonomous organisations of this Department and a need was felt to build the capacity of teachers through an integrated training programme with standardised and comprehensive training modules.  Therefore,  this year, it was decided to launch a massive Integrated Teacher Training Programme under the Samagra Shiksha at the elementary level covering around 42 lakh participants including all teachers in the Government elementary schools, all Principals and Heads of elementary level schools, faculty members of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET)s, State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT)s, Block Resource Coordinator (BRC)s, Cluster Resource Coordinator (CRC)s.Modules for this training programme have been developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) through a consultative process involving States and UTs and the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan( KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).Specific training modules on ‘Developing personal-social qualities and creating safe and healthy school environment’ and ‘Health and Well Being in Schools’ have been developed under the programme. The Integrated Programme therefore seeks to train all school heads and teachers to act as first level counsellors so that they can be alert and responsive to the needs of the students, the school and indeed themselves.(d) to (e):The duration of the training is 5 days and the training will start from August 2019.****
