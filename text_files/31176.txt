The train no. 19409/19410 Ahmedabad-Gorakhpur Express is not weekly but a bi-weekly service.  Further, in addition to 19409/19410 Ahmedabad-Gorakhpur Express, 02 pairs of trains also serve  the Ahmedabad-Abu Road-Pindwara-Gorakhpur  sector and cater to the needs of the passengers of Abu Road/Pindwara.
