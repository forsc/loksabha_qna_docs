                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 162 BY SHRI NIHAL CHAND TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING LHB COACHES. (a)  & (b) At present,  411 pairs of trains on Indian Railways are operating with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. From the year 2018-19 onwards, the Production Units of Indian Railways are producing only LHB coaches. Replacement of trains operating with conventional coaches into LHB coaches is being done in a phased manner based on the availability of coaching stock.(c) Modernization of trains is a continuous process on Indian Railways (IR). Introduction of Vande Bharat train sets on IR is in itself a path breaking achievement and continuous effort will be needed to proliferate the new technology. Action has also been initiated for acquiring technology for manufacture of Aluminium Body coaches in railway factories.(d) & (e) Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continuous basis to prevent accidents and to enhance safety.  These include timely replacement of over-aged assets, adoption of suitable technologies for up-gradation and maintenance of track, rolling stock, signalling and interlocking systems, safety drives, greater emphasis on training of officials and safety inspections at regular intervals to monitor and educate staff for observance of safe practices.   Safety devices/systems being used to prevent accidents include Electronic Interlocking, track circuiting, provision of Block Proving Axle Counters, Colour Light LED Signals, Train Protection and Warning System, Vigilance Control Device, Fog Pass Device, pre-stressed Concrete Sleepers, use of Ultrasonic Flaw Detection of rails and welds at predefined periodicity to detect internal flaws in rails/welds.  As a result, number of consequential train accidents which were 118 in 2013-14 has come down to 59 in 2018-19. Respective figure for deaths has come down from 152 to 37. Thus, 2018-19 has been the safest year in the history of Indian Railways.   Strengthening and up-gradation of security has been identified as one of the priority areas. Measures initiated for strengthening of security over Railways in recent past include provision of Close Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras at important railway stations, operationalisation and up-gradation of Security helpline number 182, installation of security equipment like baggage scanners etc., in addition, escorting of important trains by Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP). Special measures have been initiated for women security like formation of special ladies squads, prosecution of offenders under the provisions of the Railways Act. Prevention and detection of crime and maintenance of law and order in Railway station premises as well as in running trains are the statutory responsibility of State Governments, which they discharge through the GRP. Railways, through the RPF, are supplementing efforts of respective States to strengthen security across Indian Railways. For regular monitoring and review of security arrangements for the Railways, State Level Security Committee for Railway (SLSCR) have been constituted for all States/Union Territories (UTs) under the Chairmanship of respective Director General of Police/Commissioner of State/UTs.*****
