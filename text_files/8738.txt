                                                        THE MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAM VILAS PASWAN)(a) to (e) :  	 A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*201 FOR 03.12.2019 REGARDING REVIEW OF STANDARDS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) :	The pioneering effort to have ‘One Nation, One Standard’ envisages to harmonize the standardization activity in the country by recognizing/accrediting the various Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) in the country and converging all the standards into National Standards thereby ensuring that there is only one national standard for one product/process/service in the country.  In this regard, a meeting was held on 2-12-19 with various stakeholders.With a view to sustain the reforms in Public Distribution System (PDS), brought in by the scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations’ and to further introduce new reforms, the Department of Food & Public Distribution, in association with all State/UT Governments has started the implementation of nation-wide portability of the benefits under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) i.e. eligible households/beneficiaries covered under NFSA would be able to lift their entitled food grains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country by using the same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device at an FPS of Destination/Sale State through ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ Plan. The facility of inter-State portability under this initiative would be available only through the FPSs having fully online ePoS devices. This system would largely benefit the numerous migratory beneficiaries such as labourers, daily wagers, blue-collar workers, etc. who frequently change their place of dwelling in search of employment or for other reasons across the country. (b)  :	The Department of Consumer Affairs has reviewed the process of making standards on 12 September 2019 and has directed BIS to develop roadmap for implementation of ‘One Nation, One Standard’. BIS is operating product certification scheme as per the provisions of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018. Under these regulations Scheme-I is Conformity Assessment scheme for Grant of licence to use or apply Standard Mark (ISI) on goods and articles manufactured in a manufacturing premises and conforming to requirements of Indian Standard. Licence  to  use  the  Standard  Mark  on  a  product  is granted after assessment of  the  capability  of  the  applicant through a visit to the manufacturing premises, to  manufacture  the product  continuously  in accordance  with  the  relevant  Indian  Standard  and  quality  control  facilities including availability of test equipment and competent manpower. Conformity of the product to the relevant Indian standard is also verified through testing in the factory as well as complete testing in a third party laboratory. The  manufacturer  is  required  to operate  a  well-defined Scheme  of Inspection and Testing  and  (SIT),  which  prescribes  the specific  tests  as per relevant Indian standard and  the  frequency  for  conducting  them.BIS also carries out surveillance on the manufacturers holding BIS licence through visit to the factory premises at periodic intervals. During the surveillance, verification of the implementation of Scheme of Inspection and Testing and compliance of the product to relevant standard is verified. Product samples are also drawn and sent to third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard.In addition, samples of the product bearing BIS standard mark are also purchased from the market and got tested at third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard. Based on the non-conformance if any, observed from the test report, action is initiated against the manufacturer depending on the severity.Whenever any Indian Standard is revised or amended, the licence holders are communicated regarding revision or amendment of the Indian Standard for which they are required to implement the same within the specified time limit.(c) & (d)  :	BIS has formulated more than 20,000 Indian Standards covering products, method of test, code of practice etc., which are primarily voluntary in nature. Indian Standards are harmonized with International Standards, wherever possible. BIS has granted about 998 licence to overseas firms spreading across about 51 countries for various products as per Indian Standards.The Central Government through issuance of various Quality Control Orders has brought 155 products (List enclosed at Annexure-I) under compulsory BIS certification and 50 Electronics, IT & Solar products under compulsory registration of BIS (List enclosed at Annexure-II).According to these Quality Control Orders, the products specified therein shall conform to relevant Indian Standards and bear standard mark under a licence from BIS. Such products cannot be imported into the country without bearing the standard mark under a licence from BIS. It thus ensures that such products conforming to the relevant Indian Standards only can be imported(e)	:	Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the nodal regulatory agency for control of medical devices in the country as notified by the Medical Devices Rules, 2017 which stipulate the conformance of notified medical devices to Indian Standards, wherever available.BIS has formulated 1338 Indian Standards relating to healthcare which include more than 1000 Standards on medical devices.  All these standards have been adopted by CDSCO as per Medical Device Rules  2017.  Presently, BIS certification is mandatory for three devices, namely clinical thermometers (IS 3055-1 &2)and X-Ray Equipment (IS 7620-1).  The quality of these devices is monitored through surveillance audits and laboratory testing. ***** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (c) & (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*201 FOR 03.12.2019 REGARDING REVIEW OF STANDARDS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIST OF PRODUCTS UNDER MANDATORY CERTIFICATIONSr No.	IS No.	ProductCement  - 131.
