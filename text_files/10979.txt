KIRAN Scheme also has capacity building programmes under ‘National Program for Training of Women Scientists & Technologists’ working in Government Sector in the fields of research & development, entrepreneurship, managerial skills and leadership. In addition to above, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) is also implementing Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orientation Programme (BioCARe) to enhance the participation of Women Scientists in Biotechnology research.(b)	The Department of Science & Technology (DST) has various Science and Technology programmes for women.

The scheme is implemented through grant-in-aid projects to S&T based Government and Non-Government Organizations. Besides individual projects, the scheme also focuses on establishing Women Technology Parks (WTPs) that are envisaged to act as a resource centre to train women in rural technologies based on the natural resources for their livelihood and income generation. Around 7,000 women have been trained over last three years through 42 WTPs and individual projects located in different parts of the country.(d)	In last three years, under S&T for Women Scheme, 82 individual projects have been implemented including six (6) in Karnataka, one (1) in Odisha, five (5) in West Bengal and three (3) in Uttar Pradesh. In addition, one (1) WTP in Odisha, two (2) WTPs in West Bengal and four (4) WTPs in Uttar Pradesh have been established.
