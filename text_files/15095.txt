DOS/ISRO had established Village Resource Centres (VRCs) on a pilot scale, in association with selected NGOs, Trusts and State Government Departments. VRCs provided various space technology enabled services such as tele-healthcare, tele-education, natural resources information, advisories related to agriculture career guidance to rural students, skill development and vocational training, etc.473 VRCs were established using satellite connectivity around the country during 2004 to 2013. Due to technological change in the communication segment, the users are adopting other connectivity solutions as alternate to space communication.A study was conducted by Social Research Division, Development and Educational Communication Unit, ISRO through rapid sample survey during 2015 and it was observed that 70% of the participants found it useful. Department of Space is willing to consider if any proposals are received for VRCs, in the areas where other terrestrial connectivity are not available in the country.(b)	to (e) Does not arise.*****
