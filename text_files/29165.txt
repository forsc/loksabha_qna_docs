ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Water Commission compiles the yearly flood damage data provided by respective State Governments subsequent to conclusion of flood period. The data for the year 2020 is yet to be confirmed by the State Governments. The economic losses due to floods do not show overall increasing trends during the last five years. The statement showing damage due to floods/ heavy rains during the last five years (including the tentative figures of 2020) is given in Annexure - I.(b) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Ministry of Jal Shkati has launched “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” with the tagline “Catch the Rain where it falls, when it falls” to nudge states and stakeholders to create appropriate Rain Water Harvesting structures(RWHS), suitable to the climatic condition and sub soil strata of the area, with people’s active participation, during the pre monsoon and monsoon period. Master Plan for Artificial  Recharge  to  Groundwater -  2020  has  been  prepared  by  CGWB in consultation with States/UTsContd…P/2 //2//which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country including estimated cost. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.42 crore Rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the Country to harness 185 Billion Cubic Metre (BCM) of monsoon rainfall. CGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme during XII Plan, under the scheme of Ground Water Management and Regulation. The Aquifer Mapping is aimed to delineate aquifer disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/ area specific ground water management plans with community participation. The management plans are shared with the respective State governments for taking appropriate measures / implementation. Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL) 2016 circulated by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs include provisions for Rainwater Harvesting and it has been shared with all the States / UTs. So far 32 States / UTs have adopted the provisions of rainwater harvesting of MBBL-2016. National Water Policy (2012) formulated by Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, inter-alia advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. It also advocates conservation of river, water bodies and infrastructure should be undertaken in a scientifically planned manner through community participation. Further, encroachment and diversion of water bodies and drainage channels must not be allowed and wherever, it has taken place, it should be restored to the extent feasible and maintained properly. (c) & (d) No study as such has  been  undertaken by Ministry of Jal Shakti  to ascertain the extent of decline in water harvesting due to illegal encroachment of water bodies and the same leading to  aggravation  of  flood  situation  with  each passing  year. However, CGWB periodically assesses the dynamic ground water resources of India. The most recent assessment, published in 2020, does not show any decline in the total annual ground water recharge in the country.  *****   ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a)  of Unstarred Question No. 786 answered in Lok Sabha on 02.12.2021 regarding “LOSS DUE TO FLOODS”.
