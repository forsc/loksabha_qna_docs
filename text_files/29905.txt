                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)  Yes Sir. In order to achieve “Housing for All” in rural areas, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f.     1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 crore Pucca houses with basic amenities.  Under PMAY-G, a total target of 2.63 crore houses have been allocated to States/UTs, out of which 2.12 crore houses have been sanctioned and 1.65 crore houses have been completed as on 02.12.2021 in the country.   (b)  The Year-wise and District-wise details of the number of houses constructed under PMAY-G during the last three years in Uttar Pradesh are given in Annexure-I. (c)  Under PMAY-G, the house is constructed by the beneficiary himself/herself or it is constructed under his/her supervision. In case, where the beneficiary is old or infirm or a person with disability, and is ,therefore, not in a position to get the house constructed on his own, such houses are taken up as part of the mason training program. There is a provision of 90/95 mandays of unskilled labour wages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) if the beneficiary constructs the house himself/herself. The Ministry has taken following steps to ensure good quality construction of PMAY-G houses:i.	The beneficiaries are being assisted in house construction with a bouquet of house design typologies inclusive of disaster resilient features that are suitable to their local geo-climatic conditions, cultural preferences and availability of construction materials. The Ministry published a compendium of region-specific house designs with the name ‘Pahal’ which includes 108 house designs for 62 housing zones in 15 states for the use of the beneficiaries.ii.	The geo-tagged and time stamped photographs of the houses at different stages of construction have been linked with the release of subsequent installments of financial assistance leading to evidence-based monitoring. The captured photographs are further being used for reviewing the construction quality/completion of the houses under PMAY-G.iii.	To avail the skilled workforce for the construction of quality houses the Ministry has launched the Rural Mason Training (RMT) program under PMAY-G in partnership with the Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) to impart training to rural masons. iv.	To bring about the effective collaboration among the academic / technical institutes and State government under PMAY-G for the technical support in quality construction of the houses and use of alternative construction technologies under PMAY-G, the guidelines have been issued by the Ministry. Accordingly, States are collaborating with the academic/ technical institutes. v.	The quality construction of the houses under PMAY-G is also being reviewed through field visits by the filed functionaries of the States/UTs, Common Review Mission (CRM) teams, officials from the Ministry, National Level Monitors, etc.vi.	For quality construction of the houses, the States/UTs have been asked to take necessary steps to ensure the sustained availability of good quality construction materials. Further, building materials manufacturers and suppliers’ associations have been asked to ensure supply of construction materials for use in the house construction under PMAY-G.(d) & (e): Yes Sir. As per Framework for Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G, there is a grievance redressal mechanism set up at different levels of administration viz., Gram Panchayat, Block, District and the State. An official of the State Government is to be designated at each level to ensure disposal of grievances to the satisfaction of the complainant. The official who is designated at each level is responsible for disposing off the grievance / complaint within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of the grievance / complaint. There is also a procedure of lodging of complaints on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal (pgportal.gov.in). The complaints received in the Ministry of Rural Development through CPGRAMS or otherwise on programme implementation are forwarded to the respective State Governments/ Union Territory (Union Territory) Administrations for redressal of the grievance. As on 03.12.2021, a total of 1,097 complaints relating to irregularities in implementation of PMAY-G since 01.01.2018 have been received in the Ministry of Rural Development on CPGRAMS. As the State Govt./UT Administration implement PMAY-G, these complaints have been sent to the concerned State Governments/Union Territory (UT) Administrations for taking necessary action under intimation to this Ministry. Out of 1,097 complaints, 964 have been disposed and remaining 133 are pending  at the level of State Government. The State/UT wise details of number of complaints received, disposed and pending are given at Annexure-II. *****
