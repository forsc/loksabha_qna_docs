ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) & (b)	Earlier, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), used to provide Wireless Local Loop (WLL) services in rural and remote areas of the country. As reported by BSNL, WLL services have been closed all over the country in the year 2018, because of obsolescence of technology for Network equipment as well as for handsets. Therefore, the issue regarding discrimination in providing WLL connections at the block level of backward districts does not arise.(c) & (d)	No, Sir; the local telecommunication authorities have not received any complaints in this regard and no such case is under investigation.******
