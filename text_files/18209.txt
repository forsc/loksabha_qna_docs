ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): As per information provided by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), till 31.08.2020, about 4 lakh passengers were brought back to India by Air India group under the Vande Bharat Mission. ;;(b): No Sir. The fare structures on each sector are designed taking into account the cost of operations, the load factors, regulatory aspects etc.;;(c) & (d): Details of fare slabs of Air India tickets from Delhi and Mumbai to the different cities of US and UK before the lockdown and fare charged from the passengers to Delhi and Mumbai from cities of US and UK after the lockdown is attached as Annexure 1 and Annexure 2.;;(e): The fares for the repatriation flights operating under the Vande Bharat Mission cannot be compared with the fares of scheduled flights on the same route due to various reasons. On many sectors, the aircraft were travelling empty (ferry) on the outbound leg and fares were high as the cost of operations had to be recovered from the one-way load. Further, the aircraft had to make halt for longer hours at various legs of journey due to COVID restrictions. Also, the COVID situation has added to the cost of operations towards PPE kits, new guidelines for ground handling, sanitizers, etc. However, these fares were substantially  lower than fares charged by some of the competitor airlines. With the establishment of Air Bubble arrangements with various countries, the fares have come down and reflect market conditions.
