                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)	- (c)	Yes Sir. There is an increase in the number of recorded disasters attributed to weather, climate and water hazards over the decade at Global level as per the Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (1970–2019) published by WMO (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10902). Following figure (Fig. 1) from this report shows that the number of disasters has increased by a factor of five over the 50 years period: whereas 711 disasters were recorded for 1970–1979, 3536 were recorded in 2000–2009 globally. Fig 1. Distribution of (a) number of disasters, (b) number of deaths and (c) economic losses by hazard type by decadeAs per recent WMO publication “State of the Climate in Asia 2020”(https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10867.pdf) also reported extreme weather related hazard over South Asia. The details of number of people affected and damage due to extreme weather over the Asian Countries is given in Fig.2.  Fig.2 Affected people and damage by climate-related hazards in Asia in 2020. Source: CRED EM-DAT (data on people affected and damage by climate-related hazards); ESCAP Sustainable Development Goals Gateway Data (https://dataexplorer. unescap.org) (data on population and GDP)Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune every year brings out publication on disastrous weather events (https://imdpune.gov.in/library/publication.html).The detailed information of loss of lives due to various disastrous weather events which happened since 2010 in India is given in Table1. The state wise loss/damage due to such events is provided in Table 2.(d) - (e)	Recognizing the damage potential of flash floods and a general lack of flash flood warning capabilities, IMD in joint collaboration with the US National Weather Service, the US Hydrologic Research Center (HRC) and USAID/OFDA has developed a Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) for South Asian region. The FFGS has been in operational mode since October 2020.The Flash Flood Guidance is a robust system designed to provide the necessary products in real-time to support the development of warnings for flash floods about 6-24 hours in advance at the watershed level with resolution of 4kmx4km for the flash flood prone South Asian countries viz. India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, covering most of the Himalayan region. Hydrology Division in IMD, New Delhi is the designated and recognised regional center by WMO for issuing the flash flood guidance for these countries. The Infrastructure for the services is set up in IMD, New Delhi.The flash flood guidance value is a diagnostic value that estimates the amount of rainfall of a given duration within a watershed that is required to produce flooding at the outlet of the catchment/ watershed. Flash flood guidance is issued for about 1 lac watersheds of the country on daily basis. Guidance for flash floods in the form of Threats (6 hours in advance) and Risks (24 hours in advance) is provided by Regional Centre to National Meteorological & Hydrological Services, National and State Disaster Management Authorities and all other stake holders for taking necessary mitigation measures to reduce the loss of life and property in the Himalayan Region countries and Sri-Lanka. This enables all the member countries for issuing impact-based flash flood forecasting at watershed and also city level as per the following color codes.Low  Probability	<30% probability of flash flood occurrence	Moderate  Probability	30 - 60% probability of flash flood occurrence	High Probability	> 60% probability of flash flood occurrence
