First-tier of this mechanism is in-house quality control at Programme Implementation Unit (PIU) level. Second-tier is structured as an independent quality monitoring at State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) in which provision of regular inspection of PMGSY works has been envisaged. The third-tier is an independent monitoring mechanism at the Central level. Under this tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are engaged for inspections of PMGSY roads, selected at random. Action Taken Reports of the road works graded as Satisfactory Requiring Improvement (SRI) and Unsatisfactory (U) by the State Quality Monitors are monitored by the respective State Governments.  Similarly, for works graded as Satisfactory Requiring Improvement (SRI) and Unsatisfactory (U) on the basis of observations of National Quality Monitors, Action Taken Reports are monitored and processed by National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA).Further, ensuring the quality of the road works is the responsibility of the State Governments, who are implementing the Programme. The State Quality Coordinators (SQCs) of the respective States have been designated as Nodal Officers for ensuring the quality and maintenance of roads under the PMGSY. ******** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part(a) of theLSUQ-2475 due for reply on 09.03.2021
