ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b):	 Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has developed Digital Forensic Kiosk (DFK), which is a stand-alone forensic hardware platform for quick preview of evidential artefacts present in electronic exhibits such as Smart Phones, SIM Cards, Memory Cards, Hard Disks and other USB storage devices.Law Enforcement Agencies like National Investigation Agency (NIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Customs, Revenue Intelligence, State Police Force can make use of the Digital Forensic Kiosk by installing at Airports, Police Stations and other places where a search for digital artefacts in the devices seized by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) is required. The LEA can conduct a primary examination of the device, keeping the integrity of the electronic data intact and can go for a forensic imaging. The primary advantage is that Kiosk shall enable the LEA to ascertain whether the suspected piece of evidence is available in the device or not and thereby unnecessary seizure of the device can be avoided. ******** Final list of the Questions
