ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors and is generally constant. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters, 1367 cubic meters, 1282 cubic meters and 1228 cubic meters in the years 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051 respectively.(b) As estimated by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2015,  62,000 Million Litre per Day (MLD) wastewater (sewage) is generated from urban centres of India. The estimation has also suggested that about 38,723 MLD untreated wastewater is being discharged on land or into rivers or creeks or coastal water.The Central Government has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of various rivers and utilization and harvesting of rain water. Under Namami Gange programme (for Ganga and its tributaries), projects have been under taken to treat the waste water before it discharges into river Ganga. As of now, a total of 150 sewerage infrastructure projects have been sanctioned at cost of Rs. 23,130.95 crores for creation of new STP capacity of 3729.92 MLD, 1114.39 MLD rehabilitated STP capacity and laying of around 4972.35 km sewerage networks.Contd…P/2//2//Regarding other rivers, the Government has been supplementing the efforts of State Governments in abatement of pollution in rivers under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) on a cost sharing basis. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.54 crore, and Central share of Rs. 2378.73 crore has been released to the State Governments for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes. Sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 MLD has been created so far under the NRCP.Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins and has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for completion of 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects, which will ensure better utilization of water.Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
