                                                        (a)	The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) for providing short-term skill training in various sectors through affiliated Training Partners. Under the scheme, placement has been linked with payout to training providers. The number of candidates placed under the Short Term Training (STT) component of PMKVY Scheme (both PMKVY 2.0 and PMKVY 3.0)is 20.74 lakh (approx.) as on 10.07.2021; the State-wise details is placed at Annexure.(b)	The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) which is the Implementing Agency of PMKVY Scheme has a mechanism of monitoring training partners imparting training at the field level. These include self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skills Development Management System (SDMS), Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres (SMART), Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS), social media platform, etc. NSDC has also formulated penalty grid for taking action against erring / non-compliant training centres / stakeholders. Based on the penalty grid, it has suspended training centres for non-compliance of PMKVY guidelines on multiple parameters and the list of such erring partners are also published periodically on the website of the NSDC. So far, 306 Training Centres (TCs) have been suspended across the different locations.(c)	There is no scope of middle men in the schemes developed and implemented by MSDE for skill training of youth.

(f)	The Ministry engaged Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) to conduct a third-party impact evaluation of PMKVY 2.0 with an objective to assess the performance of the scheme and analyse various gaps for corrective measures with regard to further improvement in the scheme.
