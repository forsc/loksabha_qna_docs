ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)  (a) to (c) Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/State Governments / Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KV as well as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.  Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that no proposal in prescribed proforma has been received from the State Government of Chhattisgarh for opening of a new KV in Balodabazar-Bhatapara district, an industrial area under Raipur Lok Sabha Constituency.  ******
