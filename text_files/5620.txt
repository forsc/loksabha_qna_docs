Accordingly, TRAI, vide letter dated 05.06.2017, advised service providers to implement at least one STV with single payment providing exclusive data benefit with validity of 365 days.(b) & (c)	As per the present tariff framework in the country, the tariff for telecommunication services is under forbearance except for national roaming, rural telephony and leased lines. Accordingly, service providers are free to offer tariffs subject to compliance with the regulatory requirements.
