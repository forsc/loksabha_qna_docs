                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c)	Yes, India has ratified 47 Conventions out of total 190 Conventions of International Labour Organisation (ILO). In addition, 1 Protocol has been ratified.The principal function of the ILO is to take care of the interests of the workers by means of setting up the international labour standards in the form of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocols which are discussed and adopted at the International Labour  Conference  of  the  ILO  every  year. ILO   Conventions    are Contd..2/-:: 2 ::international treaties, open for ratification by member countries. Ratification of an ILO Convention is a voluntary process. Once ratified, ILO Conventions create legally binding obligations on the member countries that ratify the particular Convention. As per the policy of Government of India, ILO Conventions are ratified only when we are fully satisfied that the existing laws and practices are in full conformity with the provisions of the said Convention. The implementation of ratified ILO conventions is ensured by framing legislations and amending the existing laws in line with the provisions of the Conventions. As a result, every ratified Convention in India is either backed by a supporting legal or policy framework or is embedded in the Constitutional guidelines which are adhered to in practice.  The List of ILO Conventions ratified by India is attached as Annexure.*                                                    ******
