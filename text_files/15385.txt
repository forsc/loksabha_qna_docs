                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4046 BY DR. VISHNU PRASAD M.K. TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2020 REGARDING TINDIVANAM – THIRUVANNAMALAI RAILWAY PROJECT(a) to (e): The new line project between Tindivanam and Tiruvannamalai for a length of 71 Km was sanctioned in 2006-07, anticipated cost of project is ` 900 crore, so far, an expenditure of ` 63.28 crore has been incurred on the project.Total requirement of land for the project is 662 acre.  Land acquition was initiated in 2010.  An amount of ` 14.49 crore has been deposited as an advance payment towards land acquisition to Tamil Nadu State Government during 2011, 2012 & 2017. So far, only 65 acre land is handed over to Railway.  Execution on the project depends on acquisition of land, which suffered badly due to quashing of land acquisition proceedings in the state of Tamil Nadu by Hon’ble High Court of Tamil Nadu.?	The new line project between Tindivanam and Nagari for a length of 185 Km was sanctioned in 2006-07, anticipated cost of project is ` 2,300 crore, so far, an expenditure of ` 243 crore has been incurred in the project.Total requirement of land for the project is 1798 acre (1700 acre- Tamil Nadu & 98 acre- Andhra Pradesh including forest land of 4.67 hectare in Tamil Nadu and 4.7 hectare in Andhra Pradesh). Land acquition was initiated in 2010 & 2011. An amount of ` 57.12 crore deposited towards land acquisition in Tamil Nadu and only 4.67 acres of land received so far. Regarding Andhra Pradesh, ` 16.01 crore deposited and 75.67 acres of land have been handed over to Railway.  Thus, so far, only 80.34 acres of land has been received for the project....2/--2-Railway projects don’t require environment clearance.  However, action for forestry clearance of 4.832 Hectare land in Tamil Nadu has been taken up, and stage I clearance of 4.88 Hectare forest land in Andra Predesh  has been obtained.6.5 Km long track linking work completed between Walajah road – Ranipet.  Further execution of work can be taken up only after acquisition of land by State Governments.BUDGET ALLOCATION (FOR THE PROJECT FALLING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF TAMILNADU): Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure & safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Tamil Nadu, during 2014-19 has increased to ` ¬¬¬1,979 crore, from ` 879 crore (during 2009-14). Thus, the average annual budget allocation for 2014-19 is 125% more than average annual Budget allocation during 2009-14.Total Budget Estimate (BE) outlay for Infrastructure & safety works, falling, fully/partly in the State of Tamil Nadu, in 2019-20 is ` 2,410 crore, which is 174% more than average annual Budget outlay of 2009-14.The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors  etc.  All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Therefore, confirmed time line for completion of project cannot be ascertained at this stage.*****
