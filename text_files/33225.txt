                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(Dr. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (d): COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health emergency that has led to severe disruptions in normal life, including closure of schools.   A National Achievement Survey across the country has been conducted on 12th November 2021 for Grade 3, 5, 8 and 10 students of State Government schools, Government Aided schools, Private Unaided recognized schools and Central Government schools for assessing the competencies attained by the students vis-a-vis learning outcomes.During the pandemic, the Ministry of Education has taken various steps for providing continued access to education, which are available to each category of students irrespective of their region or economic standard. A comprehensive initiative called PM e-Vidya has been started which aims to unify all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes all forms of digital modes to provide wide access- DIKSHA (online), SWAYAM (online), SWAYAM PRABHA (TV), other TV Channels including use of Doordarshan and AIR Networks. Further, an Alternate Academic Calendar has been prepared for learning solutions including self-assessment for grade 1 to 12 for both children with and without device.  Bridge Course Modules have also been developed for bridging the learning gaps of Out of School children studying in special training centres (STC) under the provisions of RTE Act, 2009. Also, PRAGYATA guidelines were issued to the States/UTs to facilitate continued education through various modes. The guidelines inter-alia include situation where internet connectivity is not available or available with very less bandwidth, resources are shared through various platforms like television, radio etc. that do not depend on internet. Where the digital facility (mobile device/DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE, Textbook, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes are being organised. Similarly, Students Learning Enhancement Guidelines were released in 2020 to support learning of children during COVID-19. Guidelines for development of e-content for children with special needs have been released. Guidelines for parent participation in Home- based learning during school closure and beyond   have also been released in 2021.National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat) Mission lays down priorities and actionable agendas for States/UTs to achieve the goal of proficiency in foundational literacy and numeracy for every child by grade 3. Detailed guidelines for the mission have been developed which includes the Lakshya or Targets for Foundational Literacy and Numeracy starting from the Balvatika upto age group 9. In addition, key competencies and learning outcomes on developmental goals have been developed and codified covering various aspects, concepts and skills for each level of education under NIPUN Bharat Mission. In addition, the Integrated Teacher Training Programme called NISHTHA 3.0 on foundational literacy and numeracy was released on 7th September, 2021 in an online mode on DIKSHA platform for 25 lakh teachers and school heads of pre-primary to class V.    A special package consisting of 12 modules have been developed for this purpose, as per objectives of NIPUN Bharat Mission.  Further, under the mission, Vidya Pravesh guidelines were developed and released on 29th July, 2021 for the children entering in Grade-I. This is a three month play based school preparation module especially design to help teachers support   children who are coming to grade-I with diverse backgrounds.  100 days reading campaign ‘Padhe Bharat’- a national initiative for creating a joyful reading experience for children was also launched on 1st January, 2022.*****
