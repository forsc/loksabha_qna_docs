ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD)(a)	Expression of Interests (EOIs) have been received. The shortlisted bidders have been allowed to conduct due diligence. The timeline is dependent on successful outcome of different stages of transaction.(b)	The Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project (PDPP) is a ‘Make in India’ initiative, which has been envisaged for production of niche Propylene derivatives viz. Acrylic Acid, Oxo Alcohol and Acrylates, using the polymer-grade propylene as the primary feedstock. These feedstocks, which were hitherto mostly imported into the Country, are now being produced from the Petro-FCCU of Kochi Refinery. The BPCL Board had approved the Propylene Derivative Petrochemical Project at Kochi Refinery on 3.12.2014 and the mechanical completion of its three units was achieved during June-August 2019 and subsequently the units came on stream and project was dedicated. Since BPCL is being divested on a ‘going concern’ basis, the business activities of the BPCL will continue after privatization.(c)	& (d): Keeping into consideration the interests of LPG consumers of BPCL, there are appropriate provisions for continuity.
