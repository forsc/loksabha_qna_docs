ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) and (b):The State-wise details of funds released under Samagra Shiksha for the development of physical/digital infrastructure of schools during last three years including Bihar are at Annexure-I. The funds are released State wise and not district wise.(c): The RTE Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools. At primary level, the PTR norm is 30:1 and at the upper primary level it is 35:1. As per the Unified District Information System For Education Plus (UDISE+) 2019-20, the PTR at national level for all schools at Primary level is 26, Upper Primary level is 18, Secondary level is 18 and Higher Secondary level is 26. The State wise PTR as per UDISE+ 2019-20 at various levels of school education is at Annexure-II.Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers come under the purview of the respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government. The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength/new schools. However, Ministry of Education requests the States and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment, through Review meetings and advisories from time to time. Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers to maintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling.*****
