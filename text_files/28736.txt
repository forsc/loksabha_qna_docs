ANSWER




                                                        ) and (b):Yes, Sir.  Government is aware of the typing errors being committed by operators in some centres including Aadhaar Seva Kendra. UIDAI for improving the system and to reduce errors has made provision for two screens in all the Enrolment Kits. The resident enrolling for Aadhaar can check the demographic details being recorded in their Aadhaar on the screen (in English and Regional Language) in front of them and ask the operator to enter correct information then and there, if entered wrongly.Further UIDAI has a comprehensive program to minimize the errors by training/ skill enhancement of its operators from time to time. Accordingly, UIDAI takes all precautions to minimize mistakes by the operators. In addition, the requests submitted by the resident are verified through various processes at back end for quality check and upon detection of any mistake, UIDAI takes action against the Registrar and operator as per the “Policy for enforcing of Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations 2016, processes, standards, guidelines, data quality and containing corrupt / fraudulent practices” available under the link: https://uidai.gov.in/images/resource/Policy-for-enforcing-process-guidelines-dated-24-03-2021.pdf The action against Registrar and Enrolment operators includes suspension of operator and imposition of financial disincentive on the Registrar.(c) and (d):No Sir. Currently there is no such proposal to amend data of Aadhaar holder in other documents while updating the database in Aadhaar. Aadhaar system has data of all Aadhaar holders of the country in a central repository. It is designed to capture minimum data so as to provide only identity related functions (issuance and authentication). Aadhaar system is not designed to collate and pool various data and hence does not become a single central data repository having all knowledge about residents. It has no linkage information (such as PAN, driving license, PDS Card, EPIC number) to any other system. This design allowed transaction data to reside in specific systems in a federated model.*******
