(c): The gap between demand and supply of coal cannot be bridged completely as there is insufficient domestic availability of coking coal and power plants designed on imported coal will continue to import coal for their production. However, there has been a consistent effort to increase domestic coal production. The all India raw coal production has increased from 565.77 MT in 2013-14 to 730.35 MT (Provisional) in 2018-19. Absolute increase in all India coal production from 2013-14 to 2018-19 is 164.58 MT as compared to an increase of coal production of 73.01 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has also increased its production from 462.41 MT in 2013-14 to 606.89 MT in 2018-19. Absolute increase of 144.48 MT as compared to increase of coal production of 58.68 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14.  In order to augment supply, a total of 84 coal blocks has been allotted under Coal Mines (Special Provision Act, 2015) so far.    Further, the focus of the Government is on increasing the domestic production of coal which includes pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal. In addition, CIL has taken the following steps to increase domestic coal production:•	CIL and its subsidiaries are going for higher capacity mega mines (Capacities > 10 MTY) with high mechanization.•	CIL has already introduced state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency. High capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMMs) like 42 cum Shovel with 240 T Rear Dumper have been introduced for this purpose. •	Surface Miners have been introduced in opencast mines in a big way to improve operational efficiency & to cater environmental needs by CIL. During 2018-19, in CIL, around 50% of the opencast coal production was through Surface miners and is likely to further increase in subsequent years.•	In underground mines, basic thrust is on mechanization of coal winning/loading system, coal drilling & supporting system, coal evacuation system etc.  High capacity Load Haul dumps (LHDs), Side Discharge Loaders (SDLs) & Universal Drill Machines (UDMs) in conjunction with belt conveyors have been introduced wherever possible. ****
