ANSWER




(a): The Government of India is making all efforts for promotion of digital payments across the country, including in remote areas. Offline digital payment solutions enable further penetration of digital payments in connectivity-constrained areas. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued the “Framework for Facilitating Small Value Digital Payments in Offline Mode” on January 03, 2022, prescribing enablement/ provision of small value digital payments in offline mode using cards, wallets, mobile devices, etc.(b) and (c): The aforesaid RBI framework allows offline payments using any channel or instrument such as cards, wallets, mobile devices etc. The framework includes broad operational guidelines  for small value offline transactions, along with appropriate provisions for user consent, security and grievance redressal. The framework is available at following URL: https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12215&Mode=0*******
