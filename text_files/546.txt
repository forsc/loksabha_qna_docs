ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):   The sowing choices of farmers depend on weather conditions, rainfall situation, irrigation facilities, inter-crop profitability, soil conditions, expectation of better remuneration from other competing crops etc. However, Government has taken several measures to increase the area coverage and productivity of pulses. Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of pulses has been substantially increased to encourage pulses production. Government is implementing National Food Security Mission-Pulses (NFSM-Pulses) in 638 districts of 29 States of the country. Under this programme, Government has taken various steps / initiatives to encourage production of pulses in the country as under:•	Breeder Seed production of pulses was introduced under NFSM-Pulses programme.•	150 Seed Hubs are implemented for increasing certified seeds of indigenous production of pulses in India through the Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR), Kanpur and its centres.•	Supplying of Seed Minikits of pulses not older than 10 years on free of the cost (100% share) to the farmers.•	In addition to State Governments, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) / Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) / State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) are also involved in conducting the demonstrations on improved latest package of practices of pulses.Contd..2/--2-•	15% allocation is earmarked for pulses under NFSM for production of quality seeds through State Governments.•	Formation of 145 Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs) through Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium (SFAC) in 11 states of the country.  Depending on domestic price and availability position, Government takes necessary steps from time to time to restrict cheap import of pulses. In this regard, measures taken by Government to restrict import on pulses over the past years are placed at Annexure.
