ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  Central Water Commission is monitoring live storage status of 140 reservoirs of the country, including those pertaining to 29 dams of Maharashtra, on weekly basis. The total live storage capacity of these 140 reservoirs is 175.957 BCM, which is about 68.25% of the live storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. The live storage capacity of the 29 monitored reservoirs in Maharashtra is 18.445 BCM.(b) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Also due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability in many regions of the country is much below the national average and this may result in water stress/scarce conditions. Further, the dynamic ground water resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board and State Governments. As per the 2020 assessment, out of the total 6965 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1114 units in 15 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where the annual ground water extraction is more than annual extractable ground water resource. 270 units have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 1057 units as ‘Semi- critical’, 4427 units as ‘Safe’ and 97 units as ‘Saline’. The details are given in Annexure.(c) & (d) Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) and Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA:CTR) were steps of the Government with involvement of officers and experts from stakeholder Ministries/ Departments for water conservation and rain water harvesting with people''s participation. There is no information on involvement of Jal Mitra in JSA/ JSA:CTR, however, some of the States may have involved volunteers at their level in water conservation awareness campaigns. (e)  Works related to conservation of natural and man-made water bodies like stepwells, tanks, ponds, johads and lakes etc., as well as formulation of policy for the same, lies in the domain of the State Government concerned. However, some of the policies framed by Government of India in order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments in this regard, are as under:1. National Water Policy 2012 formulated by this Ministry, inter-alia, provides that encroachments and diversion of water bodies (like rivers, lakes, tanks, ponds, etc.) and drainage channels (irrigated area as well as urban area drainage) must not be allowed, and wherever it has taken place, it should be restored to the extent feasible.2. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has notified Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 for protection, conservation and management of wetlands.3. The provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 are being implemented by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) /Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to regulate discharge of effluents and enforcement of standards in respect of polluting sources.4. Government of India has stipulated general discharge standards and industry specific effluent discharge standards under Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, with an aim to prevent pollution in the water bodies.5. ‘Indicative Guidelines for restoration of water bodies’ have been issued by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as a guidance to the stakeholders for ensuring restoration/ rejuvenation of water bodies.6. Guidelines for immersion of idols in water bodies formulated during 2010 has been revised and the “Revised Guidelines on Idol Immersion in Water Bodies “are being implemented in the country with effect from 1st January, 2021.********** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4816 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 31.03.2022 REGARDING “WATER CONSERVATION IN MAHARASHTRA”.CATEGORIZATION OF BLOCKS/ MANDALS/ TALUKAS IN INDIA (2020)S.No.	State/Union Territories	Total No. of Assessed Units	Safe	Semi-Critical	Critical	Over-Exploited	Saline 	States	 	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%1	Andhra Pradesh	667	551	83	40	6	15	2	23	3	38	62	Arunachal Pradesh	11	11	100								3	Assam	28	28	100								4	Bihar	534	471	88	51	10	5	1	7	1		5	Chhattisgarh	146	110	75	27	18	9	6				6	Delhi	34	3	9	7	21	7	21	17	50		7	Goa	12	12	100								8	Gujarat	248	182	73	24	10	4	2	25	10	13	59	Haryana	141	30	21	14	10	12	9	85	60		10	Himachal Pradesh	10	10	100								11	Jharkhand	259	244	94	10	4	2	1	3	1		12	Karnataka	227	130	57	35	15	10	4	52	23		13	Kerala	152	120	79	29	19	3	2				14	Madhya Pradesh	317	233	74	50	16	8	3	26	8		15	Maharashtra	353	271	77	63	18	8	2	10	3	1	016	Manipur	9	9	100								17	Meghalaya	12	12	100								18	Mizoram	26	26	100								19	Nagaland	11	11	100								20	Odisha	314	302	96	6	2					6	221	Punjab	150	17	11	10	7	6	4	117	78		22	Rajasthan	295	37	13	29	10	23	8	203	69	3	123	Sikkim	4	4	100								24	Tamil Nadu	1166	409	35	225	19	63	5	435	37	34	325	Telangana	589	321	55	180	31	44	7	44	7		26	Tripura	59	59	100								27	Uttar Pradesh	830	541	65	174	21	49	6	66	8		28	Uttarakhand	18	14	78	4	22						29	West Bengal*	268	191	71	76	28	1	0				30	Andaman and Nicobar 	36	35	97							1	331	Chandigarh	1	 		1	100						32	Dadra & Nagar Haveli 	1	1	100								 	Daman & Diu	2	1	50					1	50		33	Jammu and Kashmir	20	20	100								34	Ladakh	2	2	100								35	Lakshadweep	9	7	78	2	22						36	Puducherry	4	2	50			1	25			1	25 	Grand Total	6965	4427	64	1057	15	270	4	1114	16	97	1NoteBlocks- Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West BengalTaluks- Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, MaharashtraMandals- Andhra Pradesh, TelanganaDistrict- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Jammu & Kashmir, LadakhValley- Himachal Pradesh,Islands- Andaman & Nicobar, LakshadweepFirka- Tamil NaduRegion- PuducherryUT- ChandigarhTehsil- Delhi*West Bengal- The Ground Water Resource Assessment as on 2013 has been considered for state of West Bengal.*****
