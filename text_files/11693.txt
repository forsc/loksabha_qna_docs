However, at present, Railways have taken up 30 railway projects (14 New line, 16 Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Jharkhand under jurisdiction of East Central Railway, Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway, costing ?40020 crore, for 2607 km length, comprising 14 New Line projects having length of 1463 Km with aggregate cost of ?25,535 crore and 16 Doubling projects having 1145 Km with aggregate cost of ?14485 crore. All these projects are under different stages of planning/approval/execution. Out of above projects, 10 projects (5 new line projects having length of 299 Km with aggregate cost of ?6,470 crore and 5 doubling projects having length of 202 Km with aggregate cost of ?3,339 crore) have been included in last three years (2016-2019) and current financial year.During 2014-19, annual Budget outlay for infrastructure projects & safety works falling fully/partly in the state of Jharkhand is ?2089 Cr. which is 457% of average annual outlay of 2009-14 (?457 Crore). During 2019-20, Budget outlay for infrastructure projects & safety works falling fully/partly in the state of Jharkhand is ?2493 Cr. which is 546% of average annual outlay of 2009-14(?457 Crore).During 2014-19, commissioning of 690 Km (402 Km New Line and 288 Km of Doubling projects) have been achieved in the state at an average rate of 138 Km/year, which is 240% of commissioning during 2009-14. Recently, in Giridih area of Jharkhand, one new line project i.e. Koderma-Giridih has been completed and commissioned and one new line project i.e. Parasnath-Madhuban-Giridih (49 Km) costing ?903 Cr.  has also been taken up.Total 17 Nos. of Road over Bridges (ROBs) have been sanctioned on cost sharing with the State Govt. of Jharkhand during the last three years. During 2019-20, 41 Nos. of Road over Bridges (ROBs) have been sanctioned in Jharkhand. Out of these, 3 Nos. of ROBs have been fully completed. Railway portion of 3 Nos. of ROBs have been completed and works have been taken up on 35 Nos. of ROBs.…..2/--2-Details of projects including funds allotted/utilized are available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in > Ministry of Railways > Railway Board > About Indian Railways > Railway Board Directorates > Finance (Budget).Completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors varies project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project.To ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides, to ensure that projects are completed even before time. Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc, institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.*****
