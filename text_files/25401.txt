                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) National Water Mission (NWM), Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD &GR) has been working on one of its goals to increase water use efficiency by 20%.  NWM has launched the ‘Sahi-Fasal’ campaign to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive and economically remunerative suited to the agro-climatic zone of the area. Creating awareness among farmers on appropriate crops, micro-irrigation, soil moisture conservation etc.         The Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (DA&FW) is implementing ‘Per Drop More Crop’ component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC) which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation viz. Drip and Sprinkler irrigation.  Under the scheme, financial assistance is available @ 55% for small and marginal farmers and @ 45% for other farmers for installation of Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems. Further, 25% higher unit cost have been taken into calculation of subsidy for the North Eastern and Himalayan states and 15% higher for States with low penetration of Micro Irrigation for larger adoption of systems by the farmers under the scheme. In addition, some States provide additional incentives / top up subsidy for encouraging farmers to adopt Micro Irrigation.	DA&FW is also implementing Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) in Punjab Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh to diversify cropping pattern away from water guzzling paddy. Water conservation techniques like Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), System of Rice Intensification (SRI), alternate wetting & drying method, laser land levelling, adoption of short duration varieties, etc are promoted under the programme. Under the scheme, financial incentives/ assistance and advisories are provided to farmers.          Further, DoWR, RD &GR is implementing Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) programme under the PMKSY with the main objective of enhancing utilization of irrigation potential created and improving agriculture productivity and production on a sustainable basis through integrated and coordinated approach involving multidisciplinary team. Under the CADWM Programme, financial assistance is provided to the State Governments for Structural Interventions as well as for Non – Structural Interventions for creation and capacity building of Water Users’ Associations. Central Assistance @ 50% are being provided with a cost norm of Rs. 50,000 per hectare for development of micro irrigation infrastructure covering construction of sump, installation of water pump, and laying of piped conveyance system up to the field head.****
