ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. RCS - UDAN is a market driven scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS- UDAN. Under the scheme, besides concessions offered to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) by Central Government, State Governments and Airport operators, Viability Gap Funding is also provided to SAOs from Regional Air Connectivity Fund for affordable UDAN flights. UDAN is a self-financing scheme. Accordingly, as per the Rule 88C of Aircraft Rules, 1937, Government of India has imposed a levy of Rs. 5000/- per flight on scheduled domestic flights on routes other than category II/IIA, Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) routes and for the aircraft below 80 seats, to fund the Regional Connectivity Scheme-UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik). The levy is on each departure of the aircraft on Trunk routes, subject to certain exemptions. Thus, the airlines have to pay a levy of Rs. 5000/- per departure and it is upto the airlines how they pay this amount. Amount collected through levy is used for Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to be paid to Selected Airline for connecting the unserved and underserved airports.
