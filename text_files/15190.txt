ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): 	No direction has been given to States/UTs for issuance of new ration cards to eligible beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). However, for the sake of uniformity under ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ plan, they have been advised to adopt a standard format whenever they decide to issue/print new ration cards under NFSA in the future.  ..........2/--2-(c): 		Under PDS reforms, the Department in association with State/UT Governments is implementing a scheme on ‘Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)’ w.e.f. April 2018. This scheme inter-alia includes implementation of nation-wide portability of ration card holders covered under NFSA, to enable the migratory ration card holders in the country to lift their entitled quota of subsidised foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice anywhere in the country by using their existing/same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on a electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device installed at the FPSs through “One Nation One Ration Card” plan. The validity of the IM-PDS scheme is up to 31/03/2021. So far, under the scheme, the national/inter-State portability of ration card holders is functional in 12 States/UTs. Further, integration of remaining States/UTs depends on their readiness to implement the same. Administrative approval for the implementation of IM-PDS scheme and necessary guidelines for the implementation of inter-State/national portability under the scheme have been shared with the States/UTs.(d) & (e): 		So far, 31 States/UTs have signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department for the implementation of IM-PDS scheme including national portability of ration card holders, whereas, the Department is pursuing the signing of MoU with remaining States/UTs. 		Further, under national portability, there is no added burden on any State/UT, as the quota of foodgrains distributed to other States’/UTs’ ration card holders, shall be periodically reconciled and adjusted between the concerned States/UTs through central system. The existing system of States/UTs for distributing foodgrains to own beneficiaries remains same/unaltered, as national portability through One Nation One Ration Card plan mainly intends to benefit those ration card holders under NFSA who migrate across the country in search of temporary employment, etc.****
