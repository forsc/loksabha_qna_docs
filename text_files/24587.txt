SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): The State Government of Tamil Nadu had identified land in Sriperumbudur about 20km from Chennai city for construction of second airport near Chennai. On the request of the State Government, Airports Authority of India (AAI) undertook operational feasibility by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and submitted the report to State Government in 2011. However, no final response in the form of application for ''Site Clearance'' for the new Greenfield airport was received from State Government. Subsequently, State Government was requested to identify suitable land for establishment of new Greenfield airport for the city of Chennai and surrounding areas.  State Government in November 2019 identified two locations of Mamandur and Parandur. However, they are yet to finalize the site for setting up of the second airport near Chennai.  ;
