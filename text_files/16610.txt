ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):  The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to  examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 containing the strategy for doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022.The DFI strategy as recommended by the Committee include seven sources of income growth viz., (i) improvement in crop productivity; (ii) improvement in livestock productivity; (iii) resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; (iv) increase in the cropping intensity; (v) diversification towards high value crops; (vi) improvement in real prices received by farmers; and (vii) shift from farm to non-farm occupations.          The year 2015-16 is taken as the base year, and targeted year for doubling is 2022. After acceptance of the DFI Committee recommendations, the Government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress. (c):    As of now, there is no latest estimate of annual income of farmers achieved and the percentage annual increase for the states vis-a-vis the base year 2015-16. For the purpose of arriving at the average annual income for the year 2015-16, the DFI Committee extrapolated the NSSO survey based income estimates for the year 2012-13, and estimated that average farmers income stands at Rs. 96,703/- per year for the year 2015-16 at 2015-16 prices. State-wise average income of agricultural households at 2015-16 price is at Annexure-I.                                     It is the National Statistical Organisation (NSO) which will be conducting the Situation Assessment Survey, and then the income estimates will become available.            The Ministry is implementing various recommendations, and comprehensive interventions of the Government are having positive impact on growth of agriculture, and income of farmers.   (d) to (h): The Government has been pursuing the target of doubling farmers’ income as against the base year 2015-16, as per the annual growth targets.            The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies, that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds, and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN. The latest major intervention includes the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture’ which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of ‘Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crores.            Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake implementation of programs/schemes for the development of the sector. Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes/ programs. These schemes/ programs of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. A list of initiatives taken by the Government are at Annexure-II. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of the farmers of the country.
