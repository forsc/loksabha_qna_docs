                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (b): No Sir, the Government is not aware of any research studies which indicates impact of Carbon dioxide on depletion of the Ozone layer.The Vienna Convention for Protection of Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is responsible for protection of stratospheric ozone layer. Carbon dioxide is not recognized as an ozone depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol. (c)and  (d) :	The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system under NAPCC is aimed at evolving management measures for sustaining and safeguarding the Himalayan glaciers and mountain ecosystem. The mission includes enhanced monitoring of Himalayan ecosystems through establishment of a monitoring network, promoting community-based management, human resource development and strengthening regional cooperation. Government has prepared guidelines entitled ‘Governance for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem’ (G-SHE), which has been shared with all State Governments in the Himalayan region. Thirty-three States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s/UT’s specific issues relating to climate change. The Government is committed to taking proactive steps in protecting India’s coastal areas and coastal communities. Regulatory measures stem from the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 which is an umbrella Act and various notifications under it including Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification as amended. The Government has notified the CRZ Notification 2019 and the Island Protection Zone Notification 2019 to regulate high impact activities on the coast and in maintaining coastal sustainability.  Under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the Erosion line projected to the next 100 years based on the annual rate of erosion computed from high resolution aerial photographs and satellite images has been delineated over the entire coastline covering the mainland coastal states/UTs, by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai in co-ordination with the Survey of India (SoI), as part of Hazard line mapping. ICZM Project also includes development of the Shoreline Management Plans by the State Governments for five coastal stretches namely, Gulf of Kachchh (Gujarat), Gopalpur to Chilika (Odisha), Paradip to Dhamra (Odisha), Digha to Sankarpur (West Bengal) and Sagar Island (West Bengal). *****
