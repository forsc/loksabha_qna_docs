A dedicated microsite (www.investindia.gov.in/production-linked-incentives-schemes-india) has been created by Invest India for investors to understand various PLI Schemes.   (c), (d), (e) and (f): PLI Scheme, being Central Sector Scheme, aims to boost manufacturing across the nation and is promoted at a pan-India level.  Engagements are done directly with the State Governments to promote the Scheme to investors.
