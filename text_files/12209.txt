                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c)  Central Pollution Control Board presently monitors ambient air quality in 793 locations covering 344 cities in 28 States & 7 Union Territories across the country under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP).  As per last five-year ambient air quality data (2014-2018), most of the cities across the country were found complying to National Standards with respect to parameters for SO2 and NO2. However, with respect to PM10,102 non-attainment cities, those having PM10>60µg/m3, have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018. The list of non-attainment cities is annexed.(d) here is no established mechanism for ranking the cities in terms of pollution.It also requires authentic data and proper peer review. The government is aware that several private institutions and universities are ranking cities adopting different methodologies, different data set and using different weightages to parameters.  The data used for ranking is extracted primarily from satellite imageries, which are not validated by proper ground truthing.(e) to (f)  The Central Government launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration. Under NCAP, 102 non-attainment cities have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018. The city specific Action Plans have been prepared which inter-alia include measures for strengthening the monitoring network, reducing vehicular/industrial emissions, increasing public awareness etc. Further,the Central Government has taken several measures for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution across the country which inter alia includes issuing stringent plans like Comprehensive Action Plan, Graded Response Action Plan; increasing of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi and from by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country; Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.); ensuring the stricter norms for reducing industrial emissions; notifying  6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, C&D waste and hazardous wastes in 2016 etc.******
