As marketing of cocoon and raw silk comes under the State subject, few States provide price incentive to farmers for their cocoon produce (through regulated cocoon markets), whenever there is a fluctuation in cocoon prices. The traditional silk producing States like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal follows open auctions between farmers and the reelers. The marketing of these commodities is purely done by the State.
