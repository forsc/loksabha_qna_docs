ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) to (g)  :	The Union Government, under Consumer Awareness Scheme, has a component of releasing grants-in-aid to the State Government based on receipt of proposal specifying the activities to be carried out, funds required and utilization certificates for the grants released in previous years subject to availability of funds. A letter was received from State Government of Maharashtra with some information of 103 entities. However, the details of implementing agency of the State Government of Maharashtra and the activities proposed to be carried out along with requirement of funds were not received. Therefore, for want of specific proposal and pending utilization certificates for the funds released earlier, no funds under the Consumer Awareness Scheme could be released to the Government of Maharashtra from the year 2017 till date.*****
