ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI) (a)	& (b): Schemes being implemented by Ministry of Minority Affairs are evaluated , from time to time, by independent agency  to find out the impact of the schemes across the country including Rajasthan, on the welfare and development of minorities and to ensure that,  wherever necessary,  further refinements in the schemes are carried out so as to make the schemes more effective and to provide access to the eligible persons belonging to the six notified minority communities.  Further performance under the schemes is also monitored on a continuous basis to ensure that the desired outcome in terms of all round development of the notified minorities is achieved.(c):  The Ministry of Minority Affairs  implements Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK), a Central Sponsored Scheme, in 1300 identified Minority Concentration Areas (MCAs) of the country with the objective to develop socio-economic infrastructure and basic amenities for the welfare of the people living in the Area.   The MCAs have been identified on the basis of concentration of minority population i.e. 25% or more and backwardness in terms of socio-economic and/or basic amenity indicators as compared to national average.  Projects under PMJVK are formulated by the State Governments/UT Administrations on the basis of requirement of the MCA.    The Ministry has so far sanctioned projects of Rs.708.18 lakh having Central Share of Rs.429.89 lakhs in Banswara district of Rajasthan.  The type of projects sanctioned are 25 – Additional Classrooms, 1 Common Service Centre, 1 Degree College, 1 Teaching Aid, 2 – Toilets in School.    Dungarpur district is not an identified MCA under the PMJVK scheme. However, the feasibility of project proposal from Districts which are not identified as MCA may be explored through Cluster of Village (CoVs) approach.(d)	As per Section 2 (c) of the NCM Act, “minority”, for the purposes of this Act, means a community notified as such by the Central Government. So far, six communities viz. Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians (Parsis) and Jains, have been notified as minority communities by the Central Govt. There is no proposal to  change the standard to grant minority status at present. ********
