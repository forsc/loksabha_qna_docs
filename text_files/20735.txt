For implementation of the scheme, funds amounting to a total of Rs. 1726.67 crores have been released during 2018-21.•	Alternate avenues for the usage of paddy straw/crop residue such as use of biomass for production of PraliChar, biochar, pellets, briquettes, bioCNG, bio-ethanol etc are also being attempted. •	Coordination with ISRO for a regular availability of remote sensing monitoring data for crop burning by the farmers.(b):The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was notified by the Ministry vide dated January 12, 2017.

Task Force had conducted 68 meetings, and initiated appropriate actions. (c)&(d):Active Fire Events (AFEs) are monitored regularly to identify hotspots of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. In 2020, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Firozpur, Moga and Muktsar were identified to be top 05 districts out of 22 districts of Punjab in terms of AFE counts. The total AFE counts of these districts correspond to more than 45% of total AFE counts of all the districts.
