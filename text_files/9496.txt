                                                        MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a)	to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.************* STATEMENT AS REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 261 FOR ANSWER ON 06.12.2019(a) to (d): Advertisement displayed on television cater to various segments / sections of the society, including children.  These advertisements are required to adhere to the Advertising Codes specified under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, and special care has been taken therein for children by providing that “no advertisement which endangers the safety of children or creates in them any interest in unhealthy practices or shows them begging or in an undignified or indecent manner shall not be carried in the cable service.”Advertisements on Radio have to follow the “Code for Commercial Advertising of All India Radio” which inter alia prohibits advertisements which may adversely affect the sensibilities of children. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a voluntary self-regulatory organization, looks into all advertisement related complaints across media such as Print, TV, Radio, Hoardings, SMS, Internet/web-site, etc.  The Codes formulated by ASCI provide that “Advertisements addressed to minors shall not contain anything, whether in illustration or otherwise, which might result in their physical, mental or moral harm or which exploits their vulnerability.”*********
