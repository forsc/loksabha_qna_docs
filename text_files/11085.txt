                                                        (a) & (b): Under the schemes/programmes namely Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India  and Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS), funds are released to State Government to undertake various activities as per proposals submitted by the respective State Government and approval thereof by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) constituted in this Ministry for the purpose. Funds under these schemes are not released directly to any ITDP/ITDA. However, funds are released to State for implementation of approved projects either through Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs)/Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs) or through appropriate agency. The details of work/projects approved during the last three years under these schemes to the Government of Madhya Pradesh are given at Annexure-I & II. (c) & (d):The following steps are taken to review/ monitor the performance of the schemes / programmes administered by the Ministry: (i)	During Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) meetings the information on the completion of projects etc. is ascertained from the State Government officials.(ii)	Utilization Certificates are insisted upon as a pre-requisite for further release of funds as per the norms of GFR.(iii)	Progress reports regarding the status of implementation of schemes are obtained.(iv)	Officers while visiting States/UTs also ascertain the progress of implementation of various schemes/ programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.(v)	Meetings/ Conferences are convened at the Central level with State officials for ensuring timely submission of proposals, speeding up of implementation of the schemes/ programmes, and reviewing the physical and financial progress. 2.	   Further, an online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs with web address http://stcmis.gov.infor monitoring of Tribal Sub-Plan since 2017-18. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and gives us inputs to see through expenditure vis-a- vis allocations in respect of Central TSP. Monitoring of physical performance and outcome of initiatives has also been introduced in the system.  A customized proforma has been developed in the MIS to capture location of the ongoing projects and beneficiary details. State Governments have been shared with the necessary credentials for filling up necessary data in the MIS. From the year 2018-19, the Ministry has started conducting mid-term review with the State Governments with a view to ensure expeditious utilization of funds under the schemes of Ministry of Tribal Affairs.3.       Efforts of Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has so far yielded notable results as under:(i)	With the responsive support of State Governments, overall utilization of allocated funds under the Schemes of the Ministry has been over 90% since 2014-15 in general and almost 100% in the scheme ‘SCA to TSS’ and ‘Grant under Article 275(1) of the Constitution’ in particular. (ii)	Overall Budgetary allocation under Schemes of MoTA has substantially increased from Rs. 4279.00 crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 5957.18 crore in 2018-19.  (iii)	All the State Governments except Kerala have constituted Executive Committee under Chief Secretary for overall monitoring of TSP formulation and implementation by the line Departments.  ***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) & (b)  of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†158 for 03/02/2020 by DR.
