                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH  PATEL) (a) & (b) Since August 2019, Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country, including those in tribal areas, by 2024. As reported by States, as on date, out of 212.19 lakh rural households in ST dominated areas, 82.84 lakh (39%) rural households have been provided with tap water connection.Further, 10% weightage is assigned for population residing in SC/ ST dominated areas, while allocating the fund, to prioritize the coverage in these areas.(c) & (d) Drinking Water being a State subject, it is States, who plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual projects/ schemes for rural water supply projects are not maintained at the Government of India level. However, under JJM, States/ UTs have been advised to explore technological interventions such as Solar energy based stand-alone water supply systems so as to reduce O&M charges and dependence of electric supply for scattered/ isolated/ tribal villages.*****
