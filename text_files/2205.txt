MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	Complaints are received from time to time by the Ministry of External Affairs from and/or on behalf of Indian emigrants who are dispatched for overseas employment fraudulently by illegal agents/fake agencies and are thereafter subjected to cheating, denial of jobs, poor working conditions, etc. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has robust grievance redressal mechanisms, including online MADAD and e-Migrate portals for registration of grievances of emigrants who have been subjected to cheating.On receipt of details of such illegal agents, the complaints are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government urging them to apprehend illegal agents and prosecute them, since Law & Order is a State subject. On receiving request from the concerned State Government, Prosecution Sanction is issued expeditiously by the Ministry of External Affairs, enabling them to initiate legal action against the accused agents. Wherever required, such complaints are also referred to Missions/Posts abroad for urgent follow up with local sponsors and/or Government, and rendering all possible assistance to the aggrieved persons.Government has also issued Standard Operating Procedure to be followed by States on receipt of complaints. Visual and print media campaign is also launched from time to time, encouraging emigrants to utilize the services of the registered Recruitment Agents and not to go through illegal/fake agents.In order to promote safe and legal emigration and to curb malpractices, high-level Conferences of major labour sending States have been convened by Ministry of External Affairs, during which State Governments were inter-alia requested to pro-actively arrest the growth of illegal agents who indulge in overseas recruitment activity illegally and take strict action against them. The aspect of safe and legal migration is also included in various State Outreach Programmes (SOP) conducted in States from time to time.As per the available records, the number of complaints against unregistered agents received and referred to State Governments during the period of 2017 to May 2019 is as under:<pre>Year No. of Complaints receivedCases referred to State Governments for action Prosecution Sanction sought by State GovernmentsProsecution Sanction issued by Ministry of External Affairs20174464463030201835035015152019#2142142222</pre># (up to 31st May, 2019)***
