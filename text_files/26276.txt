ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a)       The data on nutrition indicators is captured under the National Family Health Surveys conducted periodically by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The NFHS-4 was conducted in 2015-16 and NFHS-5 was conducted in 2019-20. State/UT wise details of stunting, wasting and underweight among children under 5 years, as per NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 is annexed as Annexure I. The recently released report of NFHS-5 is available only for 22 States/UTs.A drastic change in the status of child nutrition indicators like severely wasted and stunting, which are chronic in nature, is unlikely to happen in short interval of time. As reported under NFHS-5, nutritional status has improved in many States despite the short interval of four years between the survey rounds. Furthermore, all the NFHS-5 point estimates for the nutritional indicators fall within the confidence interval and for most States no significant change is witnessed.(b)       POSHAN Abhiyaan was launched on 8th March, 2018, with an objective to reduce malnutrition and achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children from 0-6 years, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner. Mission Poshan 2.0 (Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) announced in budget 2021-2022 targets beneficiaries including pregnant women and lactating mothers, children in the age group of 0-6 years across all States/UTs and adolescent girls in the age group of 14-18 years in Aspirational Districts and NER. (c) & (d)      For the year 2020-21, the Budget  allocation for the Schemes comprising Anganwadi Services, POSHAN Abhiyan and Scheme for Adolescent Girls was ?24,482 crore and the Revised Budget allocation was ?17902.31 crore. During the year 2021-22, after rationalization, these three schemes have been clubbed and named as ''Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0'' having budgetary provision of ?20,105 crore which is 12.3% more than the Revised Budget allocation of ?17902.31 crore. Further, the expenditure of funds in respect of above three schemes was ?16233.35 crore which clearly indicates that adequate funds were available to meet the demands of the States/UTs. In order to ensure proper and effective utilisation of funds under Mission Poshan 2.0, a robust ICT enabled platform named Poshan Tracker has been designed to capture real time data on implementation and monitoring of Anganwadi Services across the country. Additional funds, if required, would be sought at R.E stage for the year 2021-22 from the Ministry of Finance. (e)      Mission Poshan 2.0 is an integrated nutrition support programme, to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Mission Poshan 2.0 has been approved for 5 years (2021-22 to 2025-26) and realigns nutrition centric sub-schemes namely Anganwadi Services (Supplementary Nutrition Programme - SNP), Scheme for Adolescent Girls, and POSHAN Abhiyaan.            Under Mission Poshan 2.0 steps have been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology to improve governance. Also, States/UTs have been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centres to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. *****      Annexure I Statement referred to in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.1904 for 30.07.2021 by SHRI ANTO ANTONY, SHRI BENNY BEHANAN, ADV.
