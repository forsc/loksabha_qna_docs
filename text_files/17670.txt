ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b):  Yes Sir. The Government has established seven National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPERs) at Mohali (Punjab), Ahmadabad (Gujarat), Hajipur (Bihar), Hyderabad (Telangana), Guwahati (Assam), Kolkata (West Bengal) and Raebareli (Uttar Pradesh) to nurture and promote quality and excellence in pharmaceutical education and research in India. (c)      A proposal for setting up of NIPER at Madurai, Tamil Nadu was approved in principle by the Central Government. Accordingly, aconsolidated proposal seeking funds for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20 for setting up and equipping the existing NIPERs and four newly proposed NIPERs at Madurai (Tamil Nadu) and in the states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra was placed for consideration of the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) in the Ministry of Finance on 26.03.2018. While the EFC approved continuation of the existing NIPERs, but it recommended for deferment of setting up of the proposed four new NIPERs at Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. (d)     The consolidated EFC proposal for the period 2020-21 to 2024-25 was again sent to the Ministry of Finance in June, 2020 for strengthening and equipping the existing NIPERs and setting up of new NIPERs in the states of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. However, the Ministry of Finance has returned back the proposal referring to their general guidelines which prescribe that the continuing schemes be appraised after 15th Finance Commission’s recommendations are accepted and resource position of public exchequer is clear.*****
