ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance(a)	As per the information provided by banks, 37.87 crore bank accounts have been opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) as on 15.01.2020. State-wise number of PMJDY accounts opened as on 15.01.2020 is at Annexure. (b)	& (c):  Accounts opened under PMJDY are Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) accounts in nature. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on BSBD accounts dated 10.08.2012 and its amendment dated 10.06.2019, there is no requirement for maintaining minimum balance in such accounts. Accordingly, no penalty is imposed on PMJDY accounts for non-maintenance of minimum balance irrespective of any direct benefit transfer being received in such accounts under any scheme.  (d) As per information provided by banks, out of a total of 37.87 crore PMJDY accounts, 30.78 crore (81.3%) accounts are operative as on 15.01.2020. State-wise number of operative PMJDY accounts as on 15.01.2020 is at Annexure. Information on the number of PMJDY accounts closed is not centrally maintained. However, cumulative number of existing PMJDY accounts monitored by this Department shows that the number of these accounts has increased every year since the launch of the scheme. *******AnnexureAnnexure as referred to  in the reply to the Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 86 to be answered on 03.02.2020 regarding '''' Charges on PMJDY Accounts''''State wise no. of PMJDY accounts and operative PMJDY accounts as on 15.01.2020S.No	State Name	No of PMJDY Accounts (in lakh)	No of operative PMJDY accounts (in lakh)1	Andaman & nicobar islands	0.49	0.322	Andhra pradesh	104.11	85.243	Arunachal pradesh	3.32	2.634	Assam	161.89	143.755	Bihar	432.03	377.296	Chandigarh	2.53	1.917	Chhattisgarh	146.76	120.718	Dadra & nagar haveli	1.27	0.959	Daman & diu	0.55	0.4310	Delhi	45.39	37.0611	Goa	1.66	1.1212	Gujarat	147.38	115.1313	Haryana	73.89	61.3814	Himachal pradesh	12.88	11.0415	Jammu & kashmir	21.11	12.3216	Jharkhand	132.07	105.2117	Karnataka	148.40	117.4918	Kerala	42.98	33.3119	Ladakh	0.19	0.1120	Lakshadweep	0.06	0.0421	Madhya pradesh	323.71	257.1022	Maharashtra	267.12	199.9323	Manipur	9.46	8.0724	Meghalaya	4.73	3.6125	Mizoram	3.11	2.0626	Nagaland	3.03	2.4227	Odisha	155.16	127.8628	Puducherry	1.58	1.3229	Punjab	69.19	54.6030	Rajasthan	266.26	221.4831	Sikkim	0.94	0.6432	Tamil nadu	106.15	82.8233	Telangana	97.56	73.7434	Tripura	8.83	8.2835	Uttar pradesh	604.86	467.7436	Uttarakhand	25.48	20.3137	West bengal	360.60	318.61Country	3786.72	3078.01Source: 18 Public Sector Banks and 14 major Private Sector Banks ( including their Regional Rural Banks)
