                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	and (b) Non-availability of infrastructural facilities at Thawe/Gopalganj precludes introduction of long distance trains therefrom. As such, introduction of a train from Thawe to Delhi is not operationally feasible, at present.     (c)	To cater to additional rush of passengers during peak/festival season etc., Indian Railways operate special trains for specific peak periods, subject to operational feasibility. Accordingly, a weekly special train viz.,   05115/05116 Chhapra-Anand Vihar (T)  Express was operated from 01.04.2018 to 25.06.2018.(d)	No, Sir. At present, there is no proposal to divert trains via Siwan-Thawe route.*****
