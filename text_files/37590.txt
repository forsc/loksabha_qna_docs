ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, Sir.(b)	The issue of payment of Dearness Relief on difference of pension of the post 1997-98 retirees and the pre 1997-98 retirees has been under litigation since 2005. Pensioners and Employees Associations in Chennai Port had filed Writ Petitions in the Hon’ble Madras High Court contending that Class I & II Port officers who retired on or after 01.01.1997 and Group C & D Port employees who retired on or after 01.01.1998 were receiving less pension than their counterparts who retired prior to 01.01.1997 and 01.01.1998 respectively. The Hon’ble Madras High Court vide judgement dated 06.08.2013 ruled in favour of the petitioners and subsequently appeals were filed by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and Chennai Port Trust first in the Madras High Court and thereafter in the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  The issue has now been finalized by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India by dismissing the Special Leave Petition filed by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and upholding the judgment dated 06.08.2013 passed by the Hon’ble Madras High Court.(c)	Yes, Sir.(d)	The Government has received representations dated 10.08.2021 and 12.01.2022 from the Visakhapatnam Port Trust Staff Association requesting this Ministry to issue Orders for payment of Dearness Relief on the difference of pension by merging to the main pension for the retirees from 1997-98 and subsequent retirees. (e)	      The judgment dated 06.08.2013 of the Hon’ble Madras High Court which has been upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated 17.12.2021, pertains only to Chennai Port and its pensioners. Granting similar relief in respect of pensioners of other Ports including Visakhapatnam Port is a policy decision which requires extensive examination of the nature and extent of anomaly and the resultant financial burden on the Port.                                    *****
