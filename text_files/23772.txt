The prices of onions in the country are monitored on a regular basis and timely efforts are undertaken towards this end. In this regard, for 2021-22, the Price Stabilization fund (PSF) for onion, buffer target of 2 LMT has been approved. The buffer would be built by procuring Rabi-2021 onion arriving from March, 2021 onwards. *****
