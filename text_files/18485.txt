ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	There is no proposal to impart Yoga education in army and any other Government institutions currently with this Ministry. However, The Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY), an autonomous body under the Ministry of AYUSH provides short term training courses (500 hours) in Yoga for Para-Military and Delhi Police personnel and on request basis to Military Personnel. The Institute has so far trained 2062 personnel and the details are as under:i.	Armed Force personnel: 158ii.	Para-Military Personnel: 1782iii.	Delhi Police Personnel:  122 (b):	Since Public Health is a State subject, organizing various competitions at district/State level to promote Yoga among the youth in their respective domains fall under the purview of the respective State/ UT governments.        Further to this, at the Central level, Ministry of AYUSH also strives to promote the system and to create awareness for the benefit of the people including rural areas. For this purpose an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. In view of the restrictions on mass gatherings arising from the contagious nature of COVID-19, the Ministry of AYUSH organized the ‘My Life, My Yoga (MLMY)’ i.e. the Jeevan Yoga global video blogging contest with attractive prizes for the winners and runners-up.     In addition, MDNIY also organizes competitions viz. Quiz, Elocution, Best Paper presentation and Poster presentation during Yoga Mahotsav every Year.
