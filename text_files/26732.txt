                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	Government has been promoting organic  farming through dedicated schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region (MOVCDNER).  Farmers are provided financial assistance (RS 31000/ ha / 3 years in PKVY and 32500/ ha/ 3years under MOVCDNER) for organic inputs such as seeds, bio/organic fertilisers, bio-pesticides, botanical extracts etc.  Support is also provided for, training of farmers, certification, value addition and marketing of their organic produce. In addition, Organic cultivation on either side of River Ganga, large area certification and support for individual farmers have also been introduced under PKVY. 	Natural farming has also been promoted under Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), a sub-scheme of PKVY since 2020-21. It emphasizes on chemical free cultivation with more stress on biomass mulching; use of cow dung-urine formulations; plant-based preparations and time to time working of soil for aeration. Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis.  Under this scheme an area of 4.09 lakh ha has been covered in eight states. 	Organic/ natural farming can be taken up on any land which is under cultivation. Further,    rainfed, hilly, remote   areas with limited or no chemical inputs are preferred as the impact of organic cultivation in terms of soil improvement due to organic inputs is more visible.  	Many Private institutions/ individuals in the country have already been involved in promotion of organic farming in terms of production, value addition, marketing   of organic products either for exports or for domestic consumption. The list of certification bodies under Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) is given at Annexure- I.
