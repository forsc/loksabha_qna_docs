                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a): Yes, Sir.  The following steps have been taken by Government to ensure timely supply of fertilizers to farmers of the country: - (I) 	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. (II)      On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system: i.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);ii.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.iii.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. iv.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability. Thus, with the steps as indicated above, Department of Fertilizers ensures availability of fertilizers at the State level and the distribution to the farmers within the State is the responsibility of the respective State Government. Further, State Governments have been adequately empowered to ensure selling of fertilizers at MRP/ reasonable prices.(b):	The requirement, availability and sales of all Fertilizers for Kharif 2019 is placed at Annexure-A.  The requirement, availability and sales of all Fertilizers for ongoing Rabi season 2019-20 is placed at Annexure-B.(c) & (d) :   Sir, Government of India has no proposal to set up new fertilizer units in the country.  However, Government of India is reviving 5 closed fertilizer plants of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL) and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFCL) namely Talcher, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Sindri plants of FCIL and Barauni plant of HFCL by setting up new Ammonia Urea plants of 12.7 Lakh metric tonne per annum capacity each, in the following states: - Sl .No.	Name of Fertilizer plant	         Name of location & State where plant is located1	Talcher Fertilizers Ltd.
