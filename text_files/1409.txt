                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):      Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had sponsored three epidemiological studies to assess the long term impact of air pollution on human health. The studies indicate several pulmonary and systemic changes, altered immunity and other health impairments associated with cumulative exposure to high level of particulate pollution that increases the risk of various diseases including respiratory diseases. The results are indicative rather than conclusive. The studies assessed the morbidity aspects and not mortality aspects.Further, Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with Public Health Foundation of India and Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation conducted the study titled “The impact of air pollution on deaths, disease burden, and life expectancy across the states of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017” published in The Lancet Planetary Health 2018 on 6th December 2018. According to article, 76.8% of the population of India were exposed to annual population-weighted mean PM 2.5 greater than 40 µg/m3, which is the limit recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India. Delhi had the highest annual population-weighted mean PM 2.5 in 2017, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana in north India, all with mean values greater than 125 µg/ m3. 1.24 million (1.09-1.39) deaths in India in 2017, which were 12.5% of the total deaths, were attributable to air pollution, including 0.67 million (0.55-0.79) from ambient particulate matter pollution and 0.48 million (0.39-0.58) from household air pollution. India contributed 18.1% of the global population but had 26.2% of the global air pollution Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2017. The ambient particulate matter pollution DALY rate was highest in the north India states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, spread across the three Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) state groups, and the household air pollution DALY rate was highest in the low SDI states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Assam in north and northeast India. (b) & (c):     The Government has taken several steps to address air pollution, which inter-alia include notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards; revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time; setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; introduction of cleaner/alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending, launching of National Air Quality index; leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards; notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules; banning of burning of biomass;  streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate;  issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution; installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries; notification of Graded Response Action Plan for Delhi and NCR; comprehensive action plan for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR.The Government has formulated National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long term time bound pan India strategy to tackle the increasing air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner. Hundred (100) non-attainment cities, including Bengaluru, have been selected for formulation and implementation of city specific action plan under NCAP. In addition, the NCAP has many additional peripheral components such as, Technical Assessment Cell, technology support, sharing of international best practices, awareness and capacity building, source apportionment studies, plantation drive, intensive inspection drive etc. to support the time bound implementation of NCAP...........................
