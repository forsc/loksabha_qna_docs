ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 for environmentally sound management of plastic waste and to reduce the proliferation of plastic in the country. The generators of waste under the Rules have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover the segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorized by them or the registered waste pickers or registered recyclers. For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic, provisions have been made for registration of all plastic recyclers with the respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees. Every urban local body has been made responsible for setting up of infrastructure for collection, segregation and processing, including recycling and disposal of plastic waste. The local bodieshave also been mandated to create awareness among all stakeholders about their respective responsibilities. (b) India is a party to the Basel Convention, which regulates the transboundary movement and disposal of wastes, including plastic waste. Basel Convention is working on management of plastic waste in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The Ministry has initiated a project with the cooperation of Norwegian Government to work to reduce marine litter and plastic pollution in the country. Similarly, a bilateral project with the German Government namely “Closing the loop of marine litter in ecosystems”has also been undertaken.  (c)    Considering the high environmental cost associated with the use of Single-use plastic, particularly the adverse effect on soil, water bodies and on marine environment, the Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022. Many States/UTs through their own notifications have imposed partial or complete prohibition on the use of plastic carry bags/single-use plastics. 32 States/UTs have issued notifications/orders/regulations stipulating a complete or partial ban on plastic carry bags and/or other single-use plastic items. The Ministry has also issued the “Standard Guidelines on Single-Use Plastic” with suggestions on different set of actions for State/UT Governments for minimisation of such itemsFurther, on the call of the Hon''ble Prime Minister, a campaign “Swachhta Hi Sewa” (SHS) was launched from 11th Sep to 27th October 2019. This campaign inter-alia focused on awareness, advocacy, collection and safe disposal of littered plastic among all stakeholders and citizens.Advisories/Instructions were also issued to Chief Electoral Officers in the State during General Election 2019, regarding phase out of Single Use Plastic. Instructions were also issued to Ministries, Departments, Offices under the jurisdiction of the Governments, Regional Offices, Schools, Corporates, Major PSUs, Institutions in 2018 & 2019 to prohibit SUP products including water bottles, take away coffee cups, lunch wrapped in disposable plastic packaging, plastic bags, disposable food containers, plates and containers made of polystyrene foam, plastic straws etc. from their offices. (d) & (e)For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic, provisions have been made in the PWM Rules for registration of all plastic recyclers with respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees. Every urban local body has been made responsible for setting up of infrastructure for collection, segregation and processing, including recycling and disposal of plastic waste. The local bodies have also been mandated to create awareness among all stakeholders about their respective responsibilities. The Rules mandate plastic producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection systems based on the principle of Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) involving the State urban development department. The Rules further mandate the producers, importers and brand owners who introduce such products in the market for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachet or pouches or packaging, by establishing a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to their products.*****
