                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e): 	As per the second round of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS-2) 2016-17, about 3% of adults (aged 15 years and above) in India are aware about e-cigarettes and there are 0.02% estimated e-cigarette users.As per a report of WHO, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) (also known as e-cigarettes) heat a solution to create an aerosol which frequently contains flavourants, usually dissolved into Propylene Glycol or/and Glycerin. ENDS aerosol contains nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco products. In addition to dependence, nicotine can have adverse effects on the development of the foetus during pregnancy and may contribute to cardiovascular disease. The WHO report further says that although nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it may function as a “tumour promoter” and seems to be involved in the biology of malignant disease, as well as of neurodegeneration. Foetal and adolescent nicotine exposure may have long-term consequences for brain development, potentially leading to learning and anxiety disorders. The evidence is sufficient to warn children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age against ENDS use and nicotine.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences has not issued any formal warning regarding harmful effects of e-cigarettes.In larger public health interest and in order to prevent the initiation of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) by non- smokers and youth with special attention to vulnerable groups, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, has issued an Advisory to all States/Union Territories to ensure that any Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) including e-Cigarettes, Heat-Not-Burn devices, Vape, e-Sheesha, e-Nicotine Flavoured Hookah, and the like devices that enable nicotine delivery are not sold (including online sale), manufactured, distributed, traded, imported and advertised in their jurisdictions, except for the purpose & in the manner and to the extent, as may be approved under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules made thereunder.
