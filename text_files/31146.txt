                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): A statement indicating the State/Union Territory (UT)-wise percentage coverage of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013 is at Annexure-I........2/---2-(b): 	Identification of beneficiaries is the responsibility of the State Governments. The identification of beneficiaries by States/UTs is a continuous process, which involves exclusion of ineligible/ fake/ duplicate ration cards and also exclusion on account of death, migration etc and inclusion on account of birth as also that of genuine left-out households. This may result in some gap in coverage of beneficiaries. (c): 	The NFSA provides for coverage upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population.  Corresponding to the all India coverage of 75% and 50% in the rural and urban areas, State-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) by using the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data for 2011-12. At present, against the intended coverage of 81.35 crore, about 79.53 crore beneficiaries are identified by the States/UTs under the Act. (d): 	Foodgrains at subsidized prices is made available by Food Corporation of India (FCI) to the States/UTs under the NFSA, for which food subsidy is released to FCI. Only in the case of States participating in the Decentralized Procurement (DCP), under which State Government take responsibility of procurement of foodgrains and its distribution to the eligible households, that food subsidy is released directly to State Governments. Ministry of Finance allocates scheme-wise fund as a whole. There is no State-wise fund allocation for Food Subsidy. A Statement indicating the fund allocated and released to FCI and DCP States under this scheme during the last five years is at Annexure-II.  Central Government also provides Central assistance to States/UTs under NFSA for meeting expenditure on intra-State movement and handling of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers’ margin as per approved norms. A statement indicating the funds released to States/UTs  under  this  scheme  during the last five years is at Annexure-III.****ANNEXURE-1ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2831 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 15.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.State/Union Territory wise percentage coverage of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013(As on 30.11.2021)Sl.
