 MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	& (b) Ministry of Minority Affairs launched Upgrading the Skills and Training in Traditional Arts/ Crafts for Development (USTTAD) scheme on 14th May, 2015 to preserve the rich heritage of traditional arts/crafts of minorities. The scheme aims at capacity building and updating the traditional skills of master craftsmen/artisans; documentation of identified traditional arts/crafts of minorities; set standards for traditional skills; training of minority youths in various identified traditional arts/crafts through master craftsmen; and develop national and international market linkages.   The training component of the scheme was started from 2016-17.  Under the scheme, USTTAD Shilp Utsav component was implemented during 2015-16 and 2016-17.  Hunar Haat is being implemented from 2016-17 as a component of USTTAD scheme. The Hunar Haat is an effective platform wherein opportunity is given to minority artisans/craftsmen and culinary experts from across the country to showcase and market their finest handicraft and exquisitely crafted indigenous products and has generated employment and employment opportunities for 2.65 lakh artisans, craftspersons and associated persons and has strengthened their market linkages.  So far, 18 Hunar Haats have been organized through National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation (NMDFC) and Maulana Azad Education Foundation (MAEF) since November, 2016 at 20161.
