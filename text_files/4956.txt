Schedule Caste & Scheduled Tribe Population, Women, Disabled and Elderly communities. Some of them are as follows:i.  	Several assistive devices like Interline Braille Slate, Refreshable Braille Device, Wheel Chairs For Different Built Environments, automatic dispenser systems for oral medication, communication system for comatose and patients with multiple disabilities, bus identification system for visually challenged, Transradial Prosthetic Arm, Functional Electrical Simulation System, low cost teaching aids for children with learning disabilities, sign language convertors were developed under the programme Technology Interventions for Disabled and Elderly.ii. 	Under the “S&T for Women” programme, a thermal sensor based monitoring system for early detection of breast cancer; a simple wearable device for screening, absolutely painless, portable, quick test time has been developed. Under Women Technology Parks, local women have been trained in emerging technologies like 3D printing of chocolates and renewable energy based fish processing system.iii. Under the Schemes, Scheduled Caste Sub Plan and Tribal Sub Plan, training and capacity building programmes in the emerging areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Big Data Analytics, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Quantum Communication, Quantum encryption (Quantum Key Distribution), Data Science & Predictive analytics, Cyber Security for physical infrastructure are being conducted for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe population.iv.
