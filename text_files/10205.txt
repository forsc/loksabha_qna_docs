                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c):  The total assessed hydro power potential in the country is 1,66,454 MW, which comprises of:Category	Potential (MW)	BasisLarge Hydropower Projects (projects of capacity  more than 25 MW)	1,45,320	Reassessment study done by CEA during 1978-1987.Small Hydropower Projects (projects of capacity upto 25 MW)	21,134	Small hydropower data-base (July 2016), prepared by Alternate Hydro Energy Centre (AHEC), IIT Roorkee.A Table showing state-wise hydro power potential is enclosed as Annexure.Large hydropower projects of cumulative capacity of 40613 MW (27.95% of potential) (excluding Pumped Storage Projects) have been installed so far. In small hydro sector, a cumulative capacity of 4647 MW (21.98% of total potential) has been installed. The slow pace of small hydropower can largely be attributed to delay in getting forest clearances, and geological and hydrological uncertainties, etc. In large hydro sector, difficult terrain, interstate disputes, rehabilitation and resettlement issues, higher capital costs resulting in higher tariffs, long gestation period, delay in getting environmental clearance are the major factors which have resulted into slow growth.(d) & (e) : 	To accelerate tapping potential of large hydropower in the country, the Government, inter-alia, has taken the following measures:(i) 	Hydropower projects of capacity more than 25 MW have also been declared as renewable energy source.(ii) 	Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) has been notified as separate entity within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).(iii) 	Tariff rationalization measures for bringing down hydropower tariff including providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff by back loading of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years, increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff.(iv) 	Budgetary support for flood moderation/ storage hydroelectric projects.(v) 	Budgetary support to cost of enabling infrastructure i.e. roads/bridges.                                            ***********
