                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The status of the projects envisaging benefits to the States of Rajasthan and Maharashtra under NPP is given at Annexure.Apart from the above, NWDA has prepared the Pre- Feasibility Reports (PFRs) of two intra-state link projects of Rajasthan and sent to the Government of Rajasthan, however, these two links are found as not feasible on techno- economic grounds. Also, Government of Maharashtra has suggested to prepare PFRs of twenty intra-state link projects, out of which NWDA prepared PFR of seventeen links and remaining three links were withdrawn by Government of Maharashtra. Further, out of above seventeen links, Detailed Project Report (DPR) of one project, namely, Wainganga (Goshikurd) – Nalganga (Purna Tapi), has been prepared by NWDA and sent to Government of Maharashtra in November, 2018.Contd…P/2//2//The Government of Maharashtra also conceived a proposal named Krishna-Bhima stabilization project to transfer flood waters by gravity from various rivers/streams in upper Krishna sub-basin of Krishna basin through a series of links. The PFR of this link project was prepared by NWDA as an intra-state link and sent to Government of Maharashtra in 2011.(b) & (c)   In respect of projects benefiting the Rajasthan State under NPP, as given at Annexure, draft FR /FR have been prepared, while, for the projects benefiting the Maharashtra State under NPP, DPR of the two links have been prepared. The Party States of Maharashtra and Gujarat have conveyed their concurrence for the DPRs of the above two link projects.(d) & (e)    The envisaged benefits through the projects under NPP for Rajasthan and Maharashtra is also given at Annexure. Further, the proposed construction period for these projects is also given at the Annexure. No ILR project under NPP has reached the stage of execution.The Government is pursuing the inter-linking of rivers (ILR) program in a consultative manner. A “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted in September, 2014 for the implementation of ILR programme. Eighteen meetings of the Special Committee have been held so far. Further, a Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers has been constituted by MoWR, RD & GR (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in April, 2015 and twelve meetings of the Task Force have been held so far. Efforts have been made for building consensus among the concerned States and also setting out road maps for implementation of the projects.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.†3836 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Inter-linking of rivers projects under NPP benefitting States of Rajasthan and MaharashtraS.
