                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	As per the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) National Cancer Registry Programme, the estimated number of incidence of cancer cases in the country including North Eastern States, is increasing. The exact number of patients suffering from Kidney aliments is not known. However, according to ICMR report entitled “India: Health of the Nation’s States”, published in 2017, the contribution of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to Disability Adjusted Life years (DALY) increased from 0.8% in 1990 to 1.6% in 2016.  The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control Non Communicable Diseases including cancer and CKD and to provide affordable and accessible care. Some of the steps taken by Central Government are as follows:I.	The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions upto the district level include awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For Cancer, the focus is on three Cancers namely breast, cervical and oral.  Many of risk factors of CKD are common to other NCDs. The interventions for CKD are included under the programme.II.	A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (diabetes, hypertension and cancer viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Screening for common NCDs is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres. These interventions will also generate awareness as risk factor of NCDs including cancer and CKD.III.	The Government of India is also implementing “Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities” Scheme under NPCDCS to assist to establish/set up State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. Oncology is one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and 2nd campus of Chittranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata has also been approved. All these will enhance the capacity for prevention and treatment of cancer in the country.IV.	Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme, rolled out in 2016 under National Health Mission, is under implementation for providing free dialysis services to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients. PMNDP has been implemented in 33 States and UTs, under which facilities for dialysis have been provided in 455 Districts in 778 Centres.(b) & (c):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide ambulance services lies with the respective State Governments/UTs. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for emergency medical transport of patients under Dial 108, Dial 102/104 ambulance services, and other patient transport vehicles, based on the proposals made by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.
