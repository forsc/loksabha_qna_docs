As per the information received from Central Statistics Office, Ministry of Statistics & PI, the share of MSME GDP (including SC/ST MSMEs) in All India GDP (at constant prices) during 2018-19 and 2019-20 was 31.65% and 31.66% respectively.The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) implement various other schemes for the growth and development of MSME sector in the country including SC/ST entrepreneurs.
