It supports States and UTs in delivering online municipal services to their citizens including women and transgenders.

Stakeholders’ consultation is part of the approach towards implementation of NUDM, and engagements have been held with various State Governments, including Tamil Nadu.  The allocation under NUDM is utilized to develop ready-to-use platforms, software applications, frameworks, tools etc. which are made available for the benefit of all States/UTs.                                ****
