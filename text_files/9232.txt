Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru for operation, management and development through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode to improve efficiency in service delivery and to bring in expertise, enterprise and professionalism at these airports, apart from bringing the needed investments in the sector.  Accordingly, AAI floated a Global Tender for inviting bids and identified the highest bidder.  Based on the same, AAI has issued the Letter of Award for leasing of Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru airports to M/s Adani Enterprises Limited. The leasing out of remaining three airports are held up due to litigation and other issues; ; (c):  AAI would continue to provide Air Navigation Services (ANS) (being statutory function) and the revenue from ANS services will continue to be received by AAI.  Further, throughout the concession period  AAI will monitor the performance of the concessionaire in respect of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as per provisions of the Concession Agreement.  The PPP project at these airports will result in enhanced revenues to the AAI by way of upfront payment towards reimbursement of unrealized investment so far made by AAI.  Besides, AAI will receive per passenger fee from the Concessionaire as per terms of the Concession Agreement.   (d): Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) has now, inter-alia, approved the re-initiation of process of strategic disinvestment of Air India & its Subsidiaries with 100 percent sale of Government of India stake in Air India along with Air India Express and Air India''s Stake in AISATS.
