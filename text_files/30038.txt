ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): The fund is allocated from the DMF to various projects to be taken up through Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra KalyanYojna (PMKKKY). Details are provided in Annexure-I.(b): Ministry of Mines has circulated guidelines for Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojna (PMKKKY) on 16.09.2015 to be implemented by the District Mineral Foundations (DMF) for taking up development and welfare projects/programs in mining affected areas and other directions from time to time. As per the guidelines, the DMFs have been instructed to spend majority of funds on the areas directly affected by mining i.e. areas where direct mining-related operations such as excavation, mining, blasting, beneficiation and waste disposal (overburdened dumps, tailing ponds, transport corridors etc.), etc. are located and a percentage of the funds on indirectly affected areas where local population gets affected on account of economic, social and environmental consequences due to mining-related operations.(c):  Ministry of Mines issued PMKKKY guidelines vide Order dated 16.09.2015 which states that “The developmental and welfare activities to be taken up under the PMKKKY should be, as far as possible, in the nature of complementing the ongoing schemes/projects being funded by the State as well Central Government. However, without prejudice to the powers of the Foundation, efforts shall be made to achieve convergence with the State and the District Plans so that the activities taken up by the Foundation supplement the development and welfare activities and are treated as extra budgetary resources for the State Plan.” (d) & (e): The contribution to DMF is not related to utilization of DMF funds. Also, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-sections (5) and (6) of Section 9B of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, the holder of a mining lease or a prospecting licence-cum-mining lease, in addition to the royalty, shall pay amount as prescribed under Mines and Minerals (Contribution to District Mineral Foundation) Rules, 2015 to the District Mineral Foundation.*****   Annexure-I referred to in part (a) of reply to Unstarred Question No – 1695State wise Fund collection under DMF (Till October 2021)Sr. No.	State	DMF Collection(In Cr.)
