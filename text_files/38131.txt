ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d):      Government has approved the scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Vikas Mission (PMJVM)’ with a total financial outlay of Rs. 1612.27 crore for implementation during the financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26.  PMJVM has been redesigned through the merger and extension of two existing schemes for promotion of tribal livelihood, i.e., “Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP” and “Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products / Produce”. Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) is the nodal agency for implementation of the Scheme.  PMJVM envisions to strengthen tribal entrepreneurship initiatives and to facilitate livelihood opportunities by promoting more efficient, equitable, self-managed, optimum use of natural resources, Agri / NTFP / Non-farm enterprises. Under the scheme ‘PMJVM’, Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides funds for procurement of minor forest produce (MFP) on minimum support price to provide a safety net to the tribals by providing a fair deal in the trade of minor forest produces.  Further, Van Dhan Vikas Kendras are set up through Tribal Co-Operative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), which targets employment generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. Under this programme, tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce (MFP) centric multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs) are set-up in the areas with significant tribal population.  A Van Dhan Vikas Kendra (VDVK) consists of 15 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) with each SHG having up to 20 members. The Kendras act as common facility centres for procurement cum value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce is expected to increase the value of the MFP considerably and consequently augment the income of the gatherers. During last three years, MFPs worth Rs. 342 Crores have been procured in the tribal areas of 16 States which have benefitted  more than 10 Lakhs MFP gatherers. TRIFED has also sanctioned 3,225 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs) associated with 9.63 Lakh beneficiaries in 25 States and 3 UTs.  State-wise No. of VDVKs sanctioned with beneficiaries since its inception in the States / UTs including Maharshtra are at Annexure 1. Under the component "Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce'' of the PMJVM Scheme, TRIFED undertakes activities to create opportunities for the Scheduled Tribes for providing a sustainable livelihood by providing institutional support for marketing  of their artifacts and products including skill development to tribal artisans. During the last five years TRIFED has benefitted 3,27,218 number of families under the scheme of Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce. Funds sanctioned to the States/UTs based on their proposals as per the laid down objectives. TDetails of funds sanctioned to States and TRIFED under the component Schemes of PMJVM including Maharashtra during last three years are at Annexure 2. During 2021-22, a total of Rs.219.90 crores  has been provided to Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) for implementation of the Scheme PMJVM. The scheme "Marketing and Logistics Development for Promoting Tribal Products from North -Eastern Region" has been approved during 2021-22 for two years which aims to strengthen livelihood opportunities for tribal artisans through increased efficiency in procurement, logistics and  marketing of tribal products. The scheme of ''Venture Capital Funds for STs'' has been approved during 2021-22. It aims to promote entrepreneurship among the Scheduled Tribes and to provide concessional finance to them.
