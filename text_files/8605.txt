ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b) No Sir. (c) No Sir. The successful rollout of GST has resulted in creation of a unified national market through seamless flow of credit and reduction in cascading of taxes. Simplification of procedures and automation of processes has reduced the overall compliance burden for the taxpayers, thereby promoting the ease of doing business in the country.(d) and (e) The return filing under GST is based on self-assessment by the taxpayers. The taxpayer declares his tax liability and avails input tax credit while filing return in FORM GSTR – 3B. Also, each taxpayer is required to declare his outward supplies in FORM GSTR-1, the details of which are visible to the recipient of such supplies as well as the jurisdictional tax officer. Such mechanism to verify the details of outward and inward supplies acts as a self-policing mechanism under GST which creates effective deterrence against tax evasion and other fraudulent activities.In order to reduce the amount of unsettled IGST, necessary amendment has been carried out to section 49 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. As per the amended provisions, taxpayer is required to first exhaust IGST credit before using the CGST/SGST credit to discharge his tax liability. The details of the IGST collection and settlement in the last three months are as follows:(in Rs. Crores)Month	         IGST Collection	IGST Refund	Net IGST	SettlementAugust, 2019	   48958	        6025	        42933	          45788September, 2019    45069	        9054	        36015	          42941October, 2019	   46517	         7741	         38776	          40613
