The Department of School Education & Literacy has, in order to prevent drop outs, lower enrolments and loss of learning, issued guidelines on 13th July, 2020 for identification, smooth admission process and continued education of migrant children.	Further, to ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, Ministry of Education has shared guidelines dated 7th January, 2021 with all States & UTs which, among others, include identification of out of school children from age 6-18 years, enrolment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued Education for children with Special Needs (CWSN), student support on school reopening and Teacher capacity building.
