Participation in national and international sports is open to all including students who fulfill the age criteria and selection criteria fixed by the concerned NSFs.(c) to (g) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the responsibility to increase participation of children and youth in sports and provide adequate facilities to impart training to children and the youth for the sports rests with the respective State/Union Territory Governments.
