ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (c) :	India’s merchandise exports has increased from 303.53 US$ billion in 2017-18 to 330. 07 US$ billion in 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 8.75% as compared to the previous year. The State/UT-wise exports including Tamil Nadu in 2017-18 and 2018-19 and growth are at Annexure-I. India’s export sector faced many challenges in the post 2013-14 period due to accentuation of the global economic / financial crisis. However, exports have been growing on a secular basis since 2016-17 for almost three years and total exports reached a new peak of more than half a trillion dollars, for the first time in 2018-19.  Government has taken following steps to increase exports: i	A new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 was launched on 1st April 2015. The policy, inter alia, rationalised the earlier export promotion schemes and introduced two new schemes, namely Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) for improving export of goods   and ‘Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS)’ for increasing exports of services. Duty credit scrips issued under these schemes were made fully transferable.ii	The Mid-term Review of the FTP 2015-20 was undertaken on 5th December, 2017. Incentive rates for labour intensive / MSME sectors were increased by 2% with a financial implication of Rs 8,450 cr per year. iii	A new Logistics Division was created in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the logistics sector.  India’s rank in World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index moved up from 54 in 2014 to 44 in 2018.iv	Interest Equalization Scheme on pre and post shipment rupee export credit was introduced from 1.4.2015 providing interest equalisation at 3% for labour intensive / MSME sectors. The rate was increased to 5% for MSME sectors with effect from 2.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the scheme with effect from 2.1.2019. v	Various measures for improving ease of doing business were taken. India’s rank in World Bank ‘Ease of doing business’ ranking improved from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019 with the rank in ‘trading across borders’ moving up from 122 to 80.vi	A new scheme called “Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)” was launched with effect from 1st April 2017 to address the export infrastructure gaps in the country.vii	A comprehensive “Agriculture Export Policy” was launched on 6th December, 2018 with an aim to double farmers’ income by 2022 and provides an impetus to agricultural exports.viii	A new scheme called “Transport and Marketing Assistance” (TMA) has been launched for mitigating disadvantage of higher cost of transportation for export of specified agriculture products.   ix	A new scheme called Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) covering export of garments and made-ups was notified on 7.3.2019 providing refund of duties/taxes at higher rates.(d) to ( e): 	The export policy is dynamic and is reviewed from time to time depending on the inputs/recommendations received from concerned line Ministries/Departments/States. A new Foreign Trade Policy will replace the current Foreign Trade Policy (2015-2020), before its expiring on 31st March 2020.***  ANNEXURE-IStatement referred to in reply of part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred question no. 678 for answer on 20th November 2019State/UT-wise export during 2017-18 and 2018-19                (value in US$ Million)S No:	States/UTs	2017-18	2018-19	% Change in 2018-19 over 2017-181	Maharashtra	69731.48	72809.28	4.412	Gujarat	66818.03	67412.15	0.893	Tamil Nadu	29754.22	30525.91	2.594	Karnataka	18052.34	17341.29	-3.945	Uttar Pradesh	13803.90	16289.17	18.006	Andhra Pradesh	13019.53	14085.63	8.197	Haryana	13263.41	13833.25	4.308	West Bengal	9148.22	10057.13	9.949	Kerala	7308.07	9834.25	34.5710	Delhi	8713.88	9464.60	8.6211	Telangana	6568.71	7168.26	9.1312	Rajasthan	6952.05	7061.61	1.5813	Madhya Pradesh	5249.96	6382.37	21.5714	Odisha	7585.01	6303.36	-16.9015	Punjab	5788.25	6038.07	4.3216	Uttaranchal	1455.46	2351.18	61.5417	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	2051.25	2143.38	4.4918	Goa	2103.17	2063.64	-1.8819	Bihar	1345.31	1640.91	21.9720	Himachal Pradesh	1221.67	1323.43	8.3321	Jharkhand	1116.53	1252.79	12.2022	Chattisgarh	1522.70	1244.10	-18.3023	Daman & Diu	956.98	1053.39	10.0724	Pondicherry	415.05	392.79	-5.3625	Assam	382.35	369.90	-3.2626	Jammu & Kashmir	148.31	196.43	32.4527	Chandigarh	69.93	71.89	2.8128	Meghalaya	85.13	53.86	-36.7329	Sikkim	13.96	7.94	-43.1530	Andaman & Nicobar	31.46	4.01	-87.2631	Nagaland	3.92	2.78	-28.9232	Manipur	1.33	2.66	99.4833	Arunachal Pradesh	5.32	2.31	-56.6334	Tripura	2.36	1.72	-27.1335	Mizoram	1.07	1.41	31.6736	Lakshadweep	0.64	0.41	-35.90Unspecified	8835.22	21290.81	145.14India''s Export	303526.16	330078.09	8.75Source: DGCI&S, Kolkata                                          *********
