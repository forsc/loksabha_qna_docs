ANSWER




                                                        (a) Government is implementing Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)/Schedule Tribe Component (STC)/Development Action Plant for STs (DAPSTs) for overall development of tribal people across the country. Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 40 Central Ministries / Departments have been mandated by NITI Aayog to earmark TSP funds in the range of 4.3 to 17.5 percent of their total Scheme allocation every year for tribal development. State Governments are also supposed to earmark Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) funds in proportion to ST population (Census 2011) in the State with respect to total State Plan. NITI Aayog from time-to-time issues guidelines for earmarking and utilization of TSP funds. The year-wise and State-wise details of funds released for tribal development programmes under TSP by obligated Central Ministries/Departments during last three years are placed at Annexure.(b) & (c) As per the SCSP and TSP guidelines of NITI Aayog, the issue of non-divertibility is already inbuilt in the system due to allocation of funds on the basis of ‘budget head’. To ensure non-divertibility of TSP funds to any other scheme, the obligated Ministries/Departments are required to place the funds earmarked for TSP under Minor Head ‘796’ below the functional major Head/Sub-Major Heads. However, some flexibility is provided in specific instances wherever deemed necessary, and in case of non-utilization under one scheme, the budget should be utilized under the other schemes of the department but for DAPST, with approval of the Ministry and Financial Adviser. Further, NITI Aayog and Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) convene meetings with obligated Ministries/Departments from time to time to review the allocation and expenditure of funds for tribal programmes and also guide them for better utilization of TSP funds. MoTA also monitors allocation, expenditure, etc. of Central TSP funds through a dedicated STC-MIS portal (https://stcmis.gov.in) regularly. No irregularities/diversion/misappropriation has been reported by any obligated Ministry/Department under STC/TSP. (d) STC/TSP funds are spent by different Central Ministries / Departments under their schemes for various development projects relating to education, health, agriculture, irrigation, roads, housing, drinking water, electrification, employment generation, skill development, etc. for accelerated socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes. In addition, Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides funds under its schemes to supplement the efforts of tribal development by other Ministries/Departments. Brief details of the schemes/programmes of the obligated Ministries/Departments under which funds are being provided for housing, water supply and sanitation in tribal areas in various States including Uttar Pradesh are as under: Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G): Department of Rural Development is implementing rural housing scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of Housing for All in rural areas. Under PMAY-G, as on 10th November, 2021, a total of 2.09 crore houses have been sanctioned and 1.62 crore houses completed. A total 46.26 lakh houses have been sanctioned to ST households, out of which 35.37 lakh houses have already been completed as on 10th November, 2021. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY- U) addresses urban housing shortage among the EWS/LIG and MIG categories including the slum dwellers by ensuring pucca houses to all eligible urban households. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has sanctioned 6,92,967 houses to ST beneficiaries out of total 1,14,01,597 houses under the scheme PMAY-Urban as on 22nd November 2021.Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM): Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal shakti in implementing JJM to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections by 2024 to all households in rural India. Under JJM, total 59,977 ST habitations were covered during 2017-18 to 2020-21. As on 09.11.2021 more than 15,750 ST majority villages have become `Har Ghar Jal` villages.Swatchh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to make the country Open Defecation Free by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households. Under the programme a total 90495324 Individual Household Latrines (IHHLs) constructed during last five years (2016-17 to 2020-21) across the country. Out of these IHHLs, 9622159 i.e. 10.63% of total individual household latrines constructed for STs. Further, Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides funds for basic amenities in tribal areas/localities under its schemes - Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS), Grants-in-aid under Provison to Article 275(1) of Constitution of India and Scheme for Development of PVTG based on the proposals received from States and after appraisal and approval of Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry.
