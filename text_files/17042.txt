ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b): The draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification 2020, issued by the Ministry neither weakens the EIA process nor encourages environment violations in any irrigation projects. No changes have been proposed in respect of irrigation projects in the Draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 when compared to the EIA Notification, 2006. The Draft EIA Notification, 2020 consolidates the developments that have taken place in the areas of  technology, institutional reforms and regulation.  It also incorporates the directions of the Hon’ble Court/Tribunal on various issues.(c) and (d): No new changes have been proposed in the draft EIA Notification, 2020 in respect of  irrigation projects that have a command area between 2,000 and 10,000 hectares when compared to the EIA Notification, 2006. All the hydro-electric projects lesser than 25MW have been proposed to be brought under the ambit of EIA Notification, 2020 under Category-B2 as against such projects being exempted in EIA, 2006 framework. Therefore, the draft EIA, 2020 infact strengthens the environmental cause in respect of this category of projects. ****
