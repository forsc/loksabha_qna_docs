                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 305 DUE FOR REPLY ON 10TH  DECEMBER, 2019.(a):     The latest available estimates of average income per agricultural household in the country are based on the “Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households” conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) during its 70th round (January 2013 – December 2013). As per the survey results, the average monthly income per agricultural household from all sources is estimated to be Rs. 6,426/. State-wise average monthly income per agricultural household is given in Annexure-I. Since the last survey was conducted in 2013, the farm incomes earned by rural households in real terms during the last three years are not available.(b) to (e):     The Government has set a target of doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. An Inter-Ministerial Committee was set up to examine issues relating to doubling of farmers’ income and recommend a strategy to achieve doubling of farmers’ income in real terms by the year 2022. The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018.   The Committee has identified seven sources of income growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.     Later, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress on recommendations. Due to concerted efforts made to align the ongoing developmental schemes by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare with the strategy of doubling farmers’ income, there has been a positive impact in the agricultural sector. Various interventions and schemes that have already been rolled out as envisaged in the recommendations of DFI Committee to double the income of farmers by 2022 are at Annexure-II.
