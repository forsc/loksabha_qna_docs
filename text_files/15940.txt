ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing its flagship demand driven scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-20), for short duration skill development training (Short-Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)) to unemployed youth across the country including States having aspirational districts. Under the scheme, placement opportunities are being provided to candidates certified under STT. RPL does not mandate placement as it orients and certifies candidate with prior learning experience or skills.Under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 17.01.2020, 40.27 lakh and 32.34 lakh candidates have been trained and certified, respectively, under Short Term Training (STT) courses. Out of these certified candidates, 16.61 lakh candidates have been provided with placement which is 51.3% of certified candidates. Also, 33.20 lakh candidates have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of the scheme.(c) and (d)	Government of India had launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative with the objective of facilitating investment, fostering innovation, building best in class manufacturing infrastructure, making it easy to do business and enhancing skill development. Action Plans for 21 key sectors were identified for specific actions under (i) Policy Initiatives (ii) Fiscal Incentives (iii) Infrastructure Creation (iv) Ease of Doing Business (v) Innovation and R&D (vi) Skill Development areas. Further, ‘Make in India’ initiative has been reviewed and is now focusing on 27 sectors. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is coordinating action plans for 15 manufacturing sectors while Department of Commerce is coordinating 12 service sectors.FDI can be one measure to track the growth of Make in India. The total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow was USD 318.80 billion between April 2014 and September 2019- representing nearly 50% of the cumulative FDI in India since April 2000. (e) and (f)	Under PMKVY (2016-20), an amount of Rs. 500 is being provided as monetary incentive to candidates on successful completion of training. There is no exclusive reward for entrepreneurs under the scheme. However, to catalyse a cultural shift in youth for entrepreneurship, the Ministry has instituted the National Entrepreneurship Awards (NEA) in 2016 to recognize and honour outstanding young first generation Entrepreneurs and their Ecosystem Builders for their outstanding contribution to entrepreneurship development.
