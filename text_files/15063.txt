Changing millennial preferences and cab aggregators may be amongst the various reasons for this slowdown, which include:•	BS VI vehicle inventory adjustments by OEMs•	Increase in Axle Load limit for commercial vehicles by 25%. This expanded freight capacity has led to shrinkage of new vehicle demand•	Increase in vehicle cost due to Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order for upfront collection of long-term 3rd party insurance premium for 3 years (new cars) and 5 years (new two-wheelers)•	Introduction of new safety and emission norms.The detail of sales of two-wheelers and tractors during the last three years is as under:Domestic Sales	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20(till Jan 20)Two-wheelers	2,02,00,117	2,11,81,390	1,52,55,979Tractor	*	786,381	6,16,076*Data not availableSource: SIAM& Tractor Manufacturers AssociationThe Government is committed to support and further encourage the auto sector through a number of policy interventions like reduction in corporate tax, increased budgetary outlay on infrastructure sector, increase in liquidity to financial institutions and linking of repo rate to interest charged on vehicle loans, reduction in GST for e vehicles and rebate in Income Tax etc.                                              -----------
