                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Shri Anurag Singh Thakur)(a): Section 8(2) of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 provides for levy of compensation cess on supply of certain goods and services which are specified in the Schedule of the said Act. Such important items which attract compensation cess are Pan Masala, Tobacco and tobacco products, Coal, Aerated Waters, Motor Vehicles etc.  (b): The details of GST compensation cess collected and compensation released to States is as follows: -                                                                          	 (Figures in Rs. Crore)	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Compensation Cess collected	62,612	95,081	95,444	21355 (till July,20)Compensation released *	41,146	69,275	1,20,498 (till Nov, 19)	65,546(till Mar’20)           * State-wise details of GST compensation released in as per  Annexure-I. (c) & (d): GST compensation cess collected in current FY 2020-21 is not sufficient to release the admissible GST compensation for period April-July, 2020. Moreover, the GST compensation cess collected till July, 2020 has already been utilized for the purpose of GST compensation released to states for the period till March, 2020. Taking into account the shortage of cess collection during current FY, Central Government has sought the legal opinion of Ld. Attorney General of India on 6 points on the issue of release of GST compensation to States and the point-wise summary of opinion given by Ld Attorney General is as per Annexure-II.           Accordingly, to discuss the issue of pending GST compensation and future course of action to meet the GST compensation shortfall has been discussed in 41st GST Council meeting on 27.08.2020 wherein States were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for current FY from market borrowing. Based upon the options exercised by the States, their compensation, borrowing, repayment etc. will be dealt as per their individual choice.****
