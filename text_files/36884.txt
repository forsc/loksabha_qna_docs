                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):		The Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme, 1952  is one of the three schemes framed under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions  (EPF & MP) Act, 1952.  The  EPF  Scheme, 1952Contd..2/-:: 2 ::aims at providing social security to employees employed in an EPF covered establishment in whole of India including Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. Under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme, 1952, an employee of any covered establishment drawing monthly wages up to Rs. 15,000 is statutorily required to join the fund and to contribute 12% of wages, which includes   basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, if any. The employer is also required to contribute 12% of the wages.A member of the EPF Scheme, 1952 is entitled to the benefit of withdrawal and advance from the EPF as per the provisions contained in the said scheme. Further, the Scheme was amended in March, 2020 by inserting the provision for allowing non-refundable advance to EPF members during Pandemic / Epidemic. This provision allowed EPF members to avail advance from their EPF account to the extent of 75 per cent of their balance or three-month wages whichever is less. The EPF members who have already availed the first COVID-19 advance can also opt for a second advance. A member is also entitled for credit of interest on his/her PF accumulations each year.The details of State/UT-wise total members as on 31.03.2021 are at Annexure-I.(b):		The details of Zone-wise average contributing members (2020-21) are at Annexure-II.(c):		 The wage ceiling for coverage under the EPF Scheme, 1952 is revised from time to time. Presently, it is Rs.15000/- per month.The Code on Social Security, 2020 (36 of 2020), was notified on 29.09.2020, which subsumes 9 Central labours laws including the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.  The Central Government may frame any other scheme or schemes for the purposes of providing social security benefits under the said Code to self-employed workers or any other class of persons as per clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 15 of the said Code. There is a provision under section 16 of the said Code which enables the Central Government to prescribe, by notification, different rates of employees’ contribution for specified period for any class of employee. However, the said Code has not yet come into force. Contd..3/-:: 3::(d):		 As per paragraph 72(6) of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme, 1952, certain accounts are classified as ‘Inoperative Accounts’ and such accounts, have definite claimants. As on 31.03.2021, the amount lying in 11,72,923 inoperative accounts was Rs. 3930.85 crore (unaudited).(e)  &  (f):	No, Sir. Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has a robust online and transparent mechanism of claims processing and settlement system in place, which is regularly monitored at the highest level. This system provides the access to the subscribers to ascertain the status of claim till the settlement is complete. The processing of claims is an ongoing activity and the time taken is less than 20 days for most of the claims. The details of Zone-wise total number of  provident fund final claims  settled during the years 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 ( 22.03.2022)  are at Annexure-III.   ***                                                       ******
