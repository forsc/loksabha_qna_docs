BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (e) Government has launched the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) on 27th September 2021 in the country. ABDM envisages to create a secure online platform connecting hospitals, clinics, pharmacy labs across the country digitally. This will be enabled though a Unified Health Interface (UHI) which is based on open, interoperable digital standards. Creation of Health ID is voluntary. ABDM is built on the principle of privacy by design and federated architecture ensuring no health data is centrally stored and only facilitates secure data exchange between the intended stakeholders after the citizens’ consent. NHA is creating awareness among the citizens about the usages and advantages of ABDM so that maximum participation from the citizens can be ensured.
