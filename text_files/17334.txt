ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  A draft Bill, namely; the National River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Bill, 2019 is under consideration with the objective to take measures for protection, management and rejuvenation of river Ganga. The draft bill has several provisions for strengthening of institutional mechanism, provision for zonal plans, provision for imposition of graded penalties, fines and imprisonment depending on the severity of offence, creation of Ganga Protection Corps for general surveillance and prevention of pollution.(c)  Namami Gange was launched in 2014-15 as an integrated mission for conservation of river Ganga and its tributaries. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), set up in 2011, has been the implementing agency of National Ganga River Basin Authority and later Namami Gange mission under overall supervision of National Ganga Council. Under Namami Gange, the previous ongoing interventions were also continued. Under the Namami Gange, for conservation and pollution abatement of the River Ganga and its tributaries, a total of 315 projects have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs 28,854 Crore. The projects are sanctioned for various activities such as sewerage infrastructure, industrial pollution abatement, Ghats & Crematoria, River Front Development, River Surface Cleaning, Institutional Development, Biodiversity Conservation, Afforestation, Rural Sanitation etc.  Under this programme, till July 2020, 132 projects have been completed, including 54 sewerage infrastructure projects. Under sewerage projects 668.70 MLD sewage treatment capacity has been added and 120 MLD treatment capacity rehabilitated. An expenditure of Rs.9370.09 crore has been incurred by NMCG through various implementing agencies since its inception in 2011-12.Contd…P/2//2//Due to various pollution abatement initiatives taken by the Government under the Namami Gange Programme, the water quality assessment of river Ganga in 2019 has shown improved water quality trends as compared to 2014.  The Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels have improved at 27 locations, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels and Faecal coliforms (FC) have improved at 42 and 21 locations respectively.As per CPCB data for 2019,the observed water quality of river Ganga indicates that Dissolved Oxygen which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria and satisfactory to support the ecosystem of river across all seasons and also for almost entire stretch of river Ganga. (d)  While several interventions have been successfully made under Namami Gange and NMCG was also notified as an authority under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, a separate legislation is likely to further strengthen the efforts especially through provision of graded penalties and for improving overall surveillance and prevention of pollution of water.  *****
