                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (c) The Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (CAFMD) is one of the two tracks of the India-U.S. Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 partnership launched at the Leaders'' Summit on Climate in April 2021 by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India and the President of the Unites States of America. The CAFMDwas formally launched on 13thSeptember 2021by the Indian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate at an event held in New Delhi. The Dialogue will not only strengthen India-US bilateral cooperation on climate and environment and helps in mobilizing finance to speed the clean energy transition,but will also help to demonstrate how the world can align swift climate action with inclusive and resilient economic development, taking into account national circumstances and sustainable development priorities.During the bilateral meet at the CAFMD launch event on 13thSeptember 2021, India and the United States of America have discussed a wide range of climate issues relating toCOP-26, Climate Ambition, Climate Finance, Global Climate Initiatives including International Solar Alliance (ISA),Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate.Consequently, during the bilateral meeting between India and the United States of America held on the sidelines of Glasgow Climate Conferenceon 10.11.2021, the United States of America has formally joined the ISA as a member country and signed the Framework Agreement, thus becoming the 101stcountry to sign the Agreement.(b) The Government had earlier set up an ambitious target of achieving 450GW renewable energy by 2030. Further, India, as a part of its national statement, delivered by Hon’ble Prime Minister at the 26thSession of the Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Glasgow, United Kingdom in November 2021, the target for renewable energy has been enhanced to 500 GW by 2030.As on 31.10.2021, India’s renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) is about 149.57 Giga Watts, which is about 38.3% of the country’s total installed electricity capacity. India’s non-fossil-fuel electricity capacity is 156.35 GW, which is around 40% of the total installed capacity. ***
