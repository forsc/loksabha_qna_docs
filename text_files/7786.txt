Details of such attacks on Indians abroad during the last three years and the current year are given below –A 13-year old Sikh boy was assaulted, mocked and threatened on 03 March 2016 in Melbourne, Australia.In 2017, a cab driver in New York city, USA was attacked, his turban was forcefully removed and racial remarks were passed.In 2018, one Sikh person was assaulted in London, United Kingdom.Three incidents have been reported in Warsaw, Poland in which three students in 2017, one Indian each in 2018 & 2019 have reported that they were attacked in alleged racial attacks.(c) 	The safety and security of Indians abroad is one of the foremost priorities for the Government of India.
