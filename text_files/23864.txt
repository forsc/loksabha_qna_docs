The average annual water resources of the 20 basins of the country have been assessed as 1999.20 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM). The per capita water availability is estimated by dividing the annual average water availability by the population. The average annual per capita water availability in the year 2011 has been assessed as 1545 cubic meters. Further, based on the above study, the average annual per capita water availability may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters by 2021. This is an average figure and will vary depending on the season and region. Water resource data is maintained basin-wise and not state-wise.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) in 2019, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. Further, Jal Shakti Abhiyan : Catch the Rain campaign has been launched by the Hon''ble Prime Minister of India on 22nd March, 2021 under which various activities will be carried out for rainwater conservation in all the districts of the country.Contd…P/2//2//Central Government has formulated the National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water.Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)-Har Ghar Jal, which aims at providing potable water in adequate quantity of prescribed quality on long-term basis to every rural households, including tribal areas of the country, through tap water connection by 2024.Government of India has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25th June, 2015 in select 500 cities and towns across the country with focus on development of basic urban infrastructure in the Mission cities.
