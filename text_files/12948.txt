ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (e): As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data on global operations, aggregate gross advances of nationalised banks increased from Rs. 11,33,137 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 34,03,717 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, the primary reasons for the spurt in stressed assets have been observed to be, inter-alia, aggressive lending practices, wilful default, loan frauds, employee misconduct / corruption in some cases, and economic slowdown. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of non-performing assets (NPAs). As a result of AQR initiated in 2015 and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn. Primarily as a result of transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, gross NPAs of nationalised banks, as per data of RBI on global operations, rose from Rs. 1,92,809 crore as on 31.3.2015, to Rs. 6,16,586 crore as on 31.3.2018, and as a result of Government’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, have since declined (as per declared results of nationalised banks) to Rs. 5,56,991 crore as on 31.12.2019. With regard to NPAs of nationalised banks as on 29.2.2020, RBI has informed that data on NPAs are submitted by banks at quarterly intervals. Bank-wise details of gross NPAs of nationalised banks are at Annex.Government has implemented a comprehensive strategy, consisting of recognition of NPAs transparently, resolution and recovery of value from stressed accounts, recapitalisation of nationalised banks, and reforms in nationalised banks and the wider financial ecosystem for a responsible and clean system. Comprehensive steps have been taken under the Government strategy to curb NPAs of nationalised banks, including, inter-alia, the following:(1)	Change in credit culture has been effected, with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) fundamentally changing the creditor-borrower relationship, taking away control of the defaulting company from promoters/owners and debarring wilful defaulters from the resolution process and debarring them from raising funds from the market.(2)	The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been amended to make it more effective, with provision for three months’ imprisonment in case the borrower does not provide asset details, and for the lender to get possession of mortgaged property within 30 days.(3)	Suits for recovery of dues are also filed by banks before Debts Recovery Tribunals (DRTs). Six new DRTs have been established to expedite recovery.(4)	Over the last five financial years and the current financial year, nationalised banks have been recapitalised to the extent of Rs. 3.18 lakh crore, with infusion of Rs. 2.78 lakh crore by the Government and mobilisation of over Rs. 0.40 lakh crore by nationalised banks themselves, enabling nationalised banks to pursue timely resolution of NPAs.(5)	Key reforms have been instituted in nationalised banks as part of the Public Sector Banks Reforms Agenda, including the following:(i)	Board-approved loan policies of nationalised banks now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail risk appraisal in project financing.(ii)	Use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted, thus mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation and fraud.(iii)	Monitoring has been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above Rs. 250 crore.(iv)	To ensure timely and better realisation in one-time settlements (OTSs), online end-to-end OTS platforms have been set up.Enabled by the above steps,  as per data of RBI on global operations, the gross NPAs of nationalised banks, after reaching a peak of Rs. 6,16,586 crore as on 31.3.2018, declined (as per declared results of nationalised banks) to Rs. 5,56,991 crore as on 31.12.2019. Further, nationalised banks have effected recovery of Rs. 3,08,370 crore over the last five financial years and the first three quarters of the current financial year, including record recovery of Rs. 86,014 crore during the financial year 2018-19.Comprehensive steps taken to check bank frauds have resulted in the amount involved in frauds of Rs. 1 lakh and above, reported by nationalised banks based on occurrence, declining sharply from Rs. 12,411 crore in FY2017-18, to Rs. 11,120 crore in FY2018-19 and to Rs. 3,739 crore in the first three quarters of the FY2019-20.The steps taken to curb bank frauds include, inter-alia, the following—(1)	An online searchable database of frauds reported by banks, in the form of Central Fraud Registry, has been set up to enable timely identification, control and mitigation of fraud risk and carrying out due diligence during the credit sanction process.(2)	Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has been enacted to provide for attachment of property of a fugitive economic offender, confiscation of such offender’s property and disentitlement of the offender from defending any civil claim.(3)	PSBs have been advised to—(i)	obtain certified copy of the passport of the promoters/directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing loan facilities of more than  Rs. 50 crore;(ii)	decide on publishing photographs of wilful defaulters, in terms of the instructions of RBI and as per their Board-approved policy; and(iii)	strictly ensure rotational transfer of officials/employees.(4)	Heads of PSBs have been empowered to issue requests for issue of Look-Out Circulars.(5)	For enforcement of auditing standards and ensuring the quality of audits, Government has established the National Financial Reporting Authority as an independent regulator.(6)	In order to bring transparency and accountability in the larger financial system, bank accounts of 3.38 lakh inoperative companies have been frozen.***** AnnexLok Sabha unstarred question no. 1645, regarding Bank NPAs Details of gross NPAs of nationalised banksAmounts in crore Rs.Bank	F.Y. 2014-15	F.Y. 2015-16	F.Y. 2016-17	F.Y. 2017-18	F.Y. 2018-19	F.Y. 2019-20 (till 31.12.2019)Allahabad Bank	   8,358 	 15,385 	    20,688 	    26,563 	    28,705 	32,150Andhra Bank	   6,877 	 11,444 	    17,670 	    28,124 	    28,974 	30,951Bank of Baroda (BoB)	 16,261 	 40,521 	    42,719 	    56,480 	    48,233 	73,140Dena Bank	   4,393 	   8,560 	    12,619 	    16,361 	    12,768 	Amalgamated into BoBVijaya Bank	   2,443 	   6,027 	      6,382 	      7,526 	      8,923 	Bank of India	 22,807 	 49,879 	    52,045 	    62,328 	    60,661 	61,730Bank of Maharashtra	   6,402 	 10,386 	    17,189 	    18,433 	    15,324 	15,746Canara Bank	 13,040 	 31,638 	    34,202 	    47,468 	    39,224 	36,645Central Bank of India	 11,873 	 22,721 	    27,251 	    38,131 	    32,356 	33,259Corporation Bank	   7,107 	 14,544 	    17,045 	    22,213 	    20,724 	19,557Indian Bank	   5,670 	   8,827 	      9,865 	    11,990 	    13,353 	13,862Indian Overseas Bank	 14,922 	 30,049 	    35,098 	    38,180 	    33,398 	23,734Oriental Bank of Commerce	   7,666 	 14,702 	    22,859 	    26,134 	    21,717 	21,634Punjab and Sind Bank	   3,082 	   4,229 	      6,298 	      7,802 	      8,606 	8,923Punjab National Bank	 25,695 	 55,818 	    55,370 	    86,620 	    78,473 	76,809Syndicate Bank	   6,442 	 13,832 	    17,609 	    25,759 	    24,680 	25,330UCO Bank	 10,186 	 20,908 	    22,541 	    30,550 	    29,888 	22,140Union Bank of India	 13,031 	 24,171 	    33,712 	    49,370 	    48,729 	49,924United Bank of India	   6,553 	   9,471 	    10,952 	    16,552 	    12,053 	11,457Source: RBI (for FY2014-15 to FY2018-19) and nationalised banks (for FY2019-20)*****
