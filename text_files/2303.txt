ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d): 	As per Section 20 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), the ‘Appropriate Government’ i.e. States/Union Territories (UTs) are required to establish the Real Estate Regulatory Authority to regulate and develop the real estate sector in the concerned State/UT.  The Real Estate Regulatory Authority of the concerned State/UT is required to register and regulate real estate projects and real estate agents registered under RERA. The Authority is also required to publish and maintain a web portal, containing relevant details of all real estate projects for which registration has been given, for public viewing.So far 28 States/UTs have set up Real Estate Regulatory Authority and 43,398 Real Estate Projects have been registered under the provisions of RERA across the country.Section 84 of RERA mandates States / UTs to notify rules for carrying out the provisions of RERA, within a period of six months of the commencement of the Act. So far 30 States and UTs have notified rules under RERA. State of West Bengal has enacted its own Act i.e. West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (HIRA) instead of notifying rules under RERA. The State Act has been challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court by a homebuyer’s association and matter is sub judice.                 ******
