ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)......2/--2-(a) & (b): 	As part of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) reforms, States/UTs have been advised that whenever they plan to issue new ration cards under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), they may conform to a standard set of data fields in the ration cards in bi-lingual format with an intent to gradually standardize the ration cards across the country. However, as such there is no immediate requirement to issue new ration cards under NFSA for the purpose of ration card portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan. To take the benefit of ration card portability under ONORC plan, any Aadhaar seeded NFSA beneficiary may lift the entitled foodgrains for self or on behalf of the complete household from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country by using their same/existing ration card with biometric authentication on an electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device. So far, the ONORC plan is enabled in 34 States/UTs covering about 75 Crore beneficiaries (94.3% NFSA population) in the country. State/UT wise status of implementation is at Annexure-I.(c) & (d): 	Under the technology driven ONORC plan NFSA beneficiaries are empowered to lift their entitled foodgrains from any FPS of their choice in the country by using their same/existing ration cards with biometric authentication on an ePoS device at any of the FPS. (e): 	Since inception of ONORC plan in August 2019 to November 2021, a cumulative total of about 49.6 Crore portable transactions have been recorded in the ONORC implemented States/UTs so far. However, as any member of an eligible ration card may lift the monthly entitled foodgrains on behalf of some or all members of the family in a single transaction, the actual cumulative number of ration card holders/beneficiaries having benefited from ONORC facility would be much higher than the total cumulative number of portability transactions recorded till date.  *** Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a)&(b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.674 FOR ANSWER ON 01.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.
