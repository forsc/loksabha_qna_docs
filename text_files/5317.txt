                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):    As per publication on Land Use Statistics for 2014-15 (latest available), State-wise details of  barren & unculturable land including the state of Rajasthan for the year 2014-15 is at Annex I.  This includes all land covered by mountains, deserts, etc. which cannot be brought under cultivation except at an exorbitant cost.(d) to (f):  As per Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Government and, therefore, it is for the State Governments to take suitable steps to convert barren land into arable land. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of State Government through various programmes.Ministry of Rural Development is implementing an Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) for development of rainfed/ degraded areas.  The IWMP has been converted   to the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Conted…2/--2-Yojana (PMKSY) from the financial year 2015-16 principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons etc.Apart from this, to reclaim and develop barren lands  ICAR has developed location specific bio-engineering measures for soil & water conservation, land management techniques, soil reclamation measures for saline, alkaline, waterlogged and acidic soils. While Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (IISWC) has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures to check soil erosion due to run-off of rain water, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur has developed sand dune stabilization and shelter belt technology to check wind erosion. ICAR through Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal and All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Salt Affected Soils has developed reclamation technology, sub-surface drainage, bio-drainage, agroforestry interventions and salt tolerant crop varieties to improve the productivity of  saline, sodic and waterlogged soils in the country. The ICAR also imparts training, organises Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs) etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.
