ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)	The quantity of import and export of graphite electrodes by Indian firms during the last three years and for the current year is as:-     (Quantity in Tonne)Year	Export	Import2016-17	62576	40572017-18	82476	52072018-19	75875	8276April, 2019 – Jan., 2020	46051	11608Source: DGFT, Ministry of Commerce & Industry(b)&(c): The price of graphite electrodes have tended to fluctuate in recent years, both globally and domestically. While the price has increased since latter half of 2017 and remained high until nearly the end of 2018, the prices have softened in 2019. As steel sector is deregulated, the impact of graphite electrode prices on steel manufacturers depend on commercial arrangements with graphite electrode suppliers. However, to provide relief to the steel producers, the Government keeps a watch on the prices of graphite electrodes and steel items and accordingly, suitable recommendations for change in Basic Customs Duty are made to Ministry of Finance from time to time.(d)	To encourage the growth of small steel companies in the country, the Government has brought National Steel Policy 2017, Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products Procurement (DMI&SP) Policy, Steel Scrap Policy, Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) alongwith making efforts for ensuring  raw material security , energy efficient technologies etc. to improve the performance of small steel companies. Ministry of Steel has also facilitated setting up of an industry driven Steel Research & Technology Mission of India (SRTMI) in association with the public and private sector steel companies to spearhead research and development activities in the iron and steel industry.********
