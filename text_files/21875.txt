ANSWER




                                                        THE FINANCE MINISTER(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement as referred to in reply of Lok Sabha Starred Question no. *274 for answer on 15th March, 2021/ Phalguna 24, 1942 (Saka) regarding “Insurance cover for COVIDSurvivors” by Dr. G. Ranjith Reddy, Hon’ble Member of ParliamentAs per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, if any person is having any co-morbid condition at the time of taking any life insurance policy, he will undergo an appropriate risk evaluation. Accordingly, a COVID survivor too, if having any such health conditions, will be evaluated in a similar manner at the point of giving a policy. If the survivor is not having any such health condition, he or she will be treated as a case of “standard life” for the purpose of giving a life insurance policy. Thus, regardless of whether a proposer happens to be a COVID survivor or not, acceptance or rejection of a proposal, processing thereof, and fixing of premium if accepted is a function of the proposer’s current health condition and the risk assessment process and underwriting by insurer, in accordance with Authority’s guidelines.***
