                                                        ):   Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology(MeitY), Government of India has initiated a project namely “Common Services Centre (CSC) 2.0” in August, 2015 under Digital India Programme, which envisages setting up of at least one CSC at Gram Panchayat (GP) to cover all the 2.5 lakh GPs across the country. Common Services Centres are internet enabled centres operated by local entrepreneur, called Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) and provide eServices to rural citizens. Over 400 digital services are being offered by these CSCs. As on Oct, 2021, the number of functional CSCs (including urban & rural areas) across the Country is 4,18,436 CSCs, out of which, 3,25,781 CSCs are functional at Gram Panchayat level. Further, the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances is the nodal agency to formulate policy guidelines for citizen-centric governance in the country. DAR&PG formulates public grievance redress mechanisms for effective and timely redress / settlement of citizen''s grievances. A Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System(CPGRAMS) has been implemented by DARPG which aimed at providing the citizens with a platform for redress of their grievances.(b):   There is presently no such proposal. However, MeitY has launched the initiative of establishing the e-Gov AppStore with the vision of accelerating delivery of e-services and optimising ICT spending of the government. All Government Apps including State Government can be uploaded on e-Gov AppStore which can be used by other States.********
