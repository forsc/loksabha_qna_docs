ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. The steps taken by the Government to improve regional connectivity under RCS - UDAN, are as under:i. The RCS - UDAN intends to enable air operations on unserved routes connecting regional areas, promote balanced regional growth and make flying affordable for masses.ii. Financial incentives in terms of concessions from Central, State Governments and airport operators are extended to Selected Airline Operators to encourage operations from unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes and to keep the air fare affordable.iii. Support to the Selected Airline Operators in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). State Governments concerned provide 20% share towards VGF for RCS flights pertaining to their states. However, the share of VGF for North-Eastern states and the Union Territories is 10%.iv. Excise Duty at the rate of 2% is levied on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) drawn by Selected Airline Operators at RCS Airports for RCS Flights for a period of three (3) years from the date of commencement of RCS flight.v. The airlines are required to commit around 50% of the seats as RCS seats (limited to 40 seats) on RCS flights.vi. Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF) is created by levying Rs.5000/- on each departure of flights on aircraft having MTOW (Maximum Take-Off Weight) above 40 Tonnes except for the departure of flights on routes in North East Region, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands.vii. For balanced regional growth, route allocations are spread equitably across five regions in the country viz. North, South, East, West and North East (with a cap of 30% in a given region).viii. RCS-UDAN is a market driven Scheme. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces.The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. ;;(b): Details of routes and airports operationalised under UDAN Scheme as on December 31, 2019 are at Annexure-A & B respectively.   (c): Details of Underserved & Unserved airports of Karnataka under UDAN 2.0 & 3.0 are as follows:  ;UDAN 2.0  Underserved :  HubballiUnserved : Baldota(Koppal),  Bellary, Chikmagalur, Ginigera, Harihar, Hassan, Kalaburgi (Gulbarga), Karwar, Kolar, Kushalnagar, Raichur &  Shahbad;UDAN 3.0  Underserved : Belagavi & MysuruUnserved : Bellary, Kalaburgi (Gulbarga), Karwar, Kolar & Kushalnagar;(d): RCS-UDAN is a market driven Scheme. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces.The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.;(e): Till 3rd round of bidding under RCS - UDAN, Mysuru, Vidyanagar, Boldota, Hubballi, Kalaburagi, Belagavi & Bidar in Karnataka have been identified for operations of RCS flights. The Selected Airline Operator(s) are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route, within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. Operations of RCS flights have already commenced from Mysuru, Vidyanagar, Hubballi, Kalaburagi & Belagavi.;(f): Under RCS - UDAN, there is a provision of revival of existing unserved airports. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal for revival of existing un-served / under-served airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Public Sector Undertakings and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions as per the RCS-UDAN Scheme.
