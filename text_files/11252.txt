(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	It is early to assess the acreage and production of rabi crops for current rabi season as sowing is still in progress in some parts of the country. As per the release calendar of advance estimates of crop production, the production and acreage of Rabi crops are normally released in mid February.

Government has recently increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif and Rabi crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing atleast 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production. Details of MSP, Cost and return over cost for year 2018-19 and 2019-20 are given at Annexure. Further, in order to increase production and acreage of agricultural crops in the country, Government of India is implementing through State Governments, several Crop Development Schemes/Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card etc. Under these Schemes/Programmes, funds are provided to States for implementation of State-specific agricultural strategies including incentives to farmers for use of quality seeds, improve soil health under Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), farm mechanization, etc. The States are also provided support for creation of agricultural infrastructure for optimal use of water and other natural resources.Government keeps close watch on import of agriculture produce in the country and take necessary steps from time to time so as to restrict cheap import of agriculture produce and protect vulnerable farmers of the country by imposing Minimum Import Price, increasing import duties, imposing Quantitative restrictions on imports and restricting their import through licensing as and when required.
