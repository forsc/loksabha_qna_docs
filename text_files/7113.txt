                                                        (a) & (b)	Urban Transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a state subject. Therefore, respective state governments are responsible for initiating and developing urban transport infrastructure including metro rail projects. The Central Government considers financial assistance for metro rail proposals in cities or urban agglomerates, on the basis of the feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned state governments.	Government of Kerala has submitted the proposals of Phase II corridor of Kochi Metro Rail of length 11.2 km extending from JLN Stadium to Infopark via Kakkanad and for the extension of the Phase I of Kochi Metro Rail from Petta to Thripunithura, over a length of 3 km. Metro Rail Projects are highly cost intensive which require extensive consultations with all the stakeholders and decision depends upon the feasibility of the project and availability of the resources.(c)	The names of cities in which metros are operational or under construction:¬S.No.	Cities with Metros	S.No.	Cities with Metros	S.No.	Cities with Metros1	Delhi*	                 10	Hyderabad	        19	Gandhi Nagar2	Noida*	                 11	Kolkata         	20	Pune 3	Ghaziabad*	         12	Chennai 	        21	Kanpur 4	Faridabad*	         13	Jaipur          	22	Agra 5	Ballabgarh*	         14	Kochi 	                23	Bhopal 6	Bahadurgarh*	         15	Lucknow 	        24	Indore 7	Greater Noida 	         16	Mumbai           	25	Patna 8	Gurugram 	         17	Nagpur          	26	Surat 9	Bangalore 	         18	Ahmedabad 	        27	Meerut# *Part of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation network # Part of Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) – Delhi to Meerut Corridor	The funds allotted for the Metro Rail Projects for 2019-20 is Rs. 19102.88 Crore.                                       *****
