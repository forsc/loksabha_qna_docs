ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (d) CGWB had a network of 15,653 monitoring wells in the year 2012. As per the EFC memorandum for the period 2012-17, it was proposed to increase monitoring wells by 35,000 through in-house as well as through participatory mode.  However, activities under the participatory ground water management component of the scheme for 2012-17 could not take off because of certain inherent limitations. As a part of inhouse activities CGWB has established additional 7,182 monitoring wells so far.Total number of wells currently being used for monitoring by CGWB in the entire country is 22,835. Apart from this, CGWB is also using the groundwater level information generated by the State Governments, who are having a network of around 43,500 wells. Further, CGWB appropriately reviews the requirement of monitoring wells as per need and initiates appropriate action accordingly. ****
