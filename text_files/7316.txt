However, as per Rural Health Statistics - 2018, State/UT wise availability of Pharmacists at Community Health Centres and Primary Health Centres in Tribal areas including in Jharkhand and vacancy thereof, is given at Annexure.

However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for engagement of Pharmacist on contractual basis, based on the proposals made by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.As per the information received from State Government of Jharkhand, total 606 posts have been sanctioned for the Pharmacist in Jharkhand, out of which 157 posts are reserved for Schedule Tribes. Only 30 Pharmacists are working against the said reserved post and rest are vacant.……………….
