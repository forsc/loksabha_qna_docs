                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT (a) to (d) REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *121 TO BE ANSWERED ON 07.12.2021. (a) The Ministry of Rural Development, inter-alia, is implementing Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana –National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) in which Self Help Groups (SHGs) are involved. These Schemes are implemented through State Governments/UT Administrations. In addition, SHGs are being involved by other Departments/Ministries and State Government Departments dealing with rural development from time to time. DAY-NRLM is being implemented across the country in a mission mode since 2011 with the aim to bring at least one woman member from each rural poor household, as per the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data and process of Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP), into the fold of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and to support them to take economic activities. As on 30th November, 2021 about 8.01 crore Women households have been mobilized into 73.19 lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs). The State/UT wise details of the number of households mobilized into SHGs since 2011 under the Mission is attached at Annexure. Under MGNREGA, SHG members are involved in the planning of works through participation in Gram Sabha projects, play the role of Social Auditors and are also engaged as worksite supervisors (mates). In addition, efforts are being made to progressively engage Federations of Women Self-help Groups as Project Implementing Agencies (PIA) at the Gram Panchayat / Block / District level. (b) Under DAY-NRLM sub-schemes like Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY), National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP), are being implemented for enhancing the income on sustainable basis of the SHGs. The Mission seeks to achieve its objective through investing in four core components viz., (i) social mobilization and promotion of sustainable community institutions of the rural poor [Self Help Groups (SHGs), Village Organisations (VOs), Cluster Level Federations (CLFs)] (ii) financial inclusion (iii) sustainable livelihoods and (iv) convergence & entitlements. Within the ambit of the mission, SHG members are being facilitated for promotion of sustainable livelihood so that they may reach an aspirational goal of having minimum of a lakh rupee as annual income. Further, the Ministry has also taken initiatives through convergence with other Ministries/Departments for enhanced livelihoods support of the SHG households.  (c) & (d) The Ministry in collaboration with Government e-Marketplace (GeM) has created “SARAS Collection” as a Store Front in GeM for marketing of SHG products. The States of Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have supported SHGs in registering on GeM portal. Also, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been entered on 2nd November, 2021 between Ministry of Rural Development and Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd. to allow the Self Help Groups (SHGs) producers including the artisans, weavers and craftsmen to access national markets through the Flipkart Samarth programme. Further, some States have also developed their own e-Commerce platform to support marketing of products of SHGs.  *****
