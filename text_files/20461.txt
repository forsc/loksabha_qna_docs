All the States had declared on Saubhagya portal that all the willing unelectrified households had been electrified as on 31.03.2019, except 18,734 households in LWE affected areas of Chhattisgarh. Subsequently, seven States namely Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reported that 19.09 lakh un-electrified households identified before 31.03.2019, which were unwilling earlier had expressed willingness to get electricity connections. The States were asked to electrify these households also under Saubhagya. Out of these, 18.57 lakh households have been electrified up to 31.12.2020. Time extension has been granted to allow the remaining households in LWE areas of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand to be electrified by 31st March, 2021. Since the launch of Saubhagya scheme, 2.81 crore households were electrified across the country up to 31.03.2020. State-wise list of such households electrified is at Annexure-I.  There is no upfront allocation of funds for any State/District under Saubhagya scheme.
