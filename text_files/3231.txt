                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (e) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******* STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.270 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON  11.07.2019 REGARDING TRANSMISSION RELATED ISSUES.*********(a) & (b) : 	About one lac twenty two thousand circuit kms of transmission lines have been added in the country during the last five years.  A robust National Grid has been established leading to One Nation - One Grid which has facilitated transfer of power from resource rich areas to load centers.  Due to this, the peak power shortage in the country has reduced from 10.6% during 2011-12 to around 0.6% during the current year.  On most of the days there is one price in the Power Exchange indicating that there is no congestion in the transmission grid.		At any point in time, power generation has to match with the demand in the Electricity Grid and this has been possible due to availability of adequate generation capacity in the country, and there being no constraints in transmission.  (c) :		A separate fund for development of transmission system is not envisaged as of now. Central Government does not grant funds for the development of transmission system except for certain strategic projects since the development of the transmission system, as envisaged in the Tariff Policy, is generally through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) mode.(d) : 		Yes, Sir. CERC has circulated the draft Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Power System Development Fund) Regulations, 2019 on 24th May, 2019 for public consultations. The draft regulations propose to repeal the CERC (Power System Development Fund), Regulations, 2014 issued on 9th June, 2014, in view of the guidelines issued by Ministry of Power (MoP) and experience gained so far in their implementation. The draft Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Power System Development Fund) Regulations, 2019 provide for changes in operating procedures, constitution of committees, implementation and monitoring mechanism etc.(e) :		Presently, the schemes received from utilities are being recommended for PSDF funding under existing CERC (PSDF) Regulations, 2014 and PSDF guidelines issued by MoP. So far, 140 Schemes have been approved for PSDF funding with a sanctioned Grant of  Rs.11,282 crores, in the presently operationalized PSDF scheme of Govt. of India. **********
