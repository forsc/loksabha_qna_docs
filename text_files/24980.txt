Further, a preliminary survey was undertaken by these RPs in April, 2018 in three villages – Neemka (Gautam Budh Nagar,UP), Oledha (Bulandshehar, UP) and Kachaida (Gautam Budh Nagar, UP).During the recent years, Sikkim ENVIS Hub (F&ED), Manipur ENVIS Hub (DoEF), and ENVIS Resource Partner at Department of Zoology, University of Madras (DZUM) conducted various activities under the Programme. ENVIS Hub Manipur conducted a pilot project in Heirok village of Thoubal District, Manipur.
