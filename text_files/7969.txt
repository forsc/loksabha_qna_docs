                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	The profit/(loss) of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) for the last three years are as under:(in Rs. crore)<pre>Year	Profit/(loss) of BSNL 	Profit/(loss) of MTNL2016-17	(4793)	(2971)2017-18	(7993)	(2971)2018-19	(14904)	(3398)</pre>Number of mobile Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) of BSNL, MTNL and other major private Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) is as under:<pre>Number of BTSs (as on 25.06.2019)BSNL	MTNL#	Reliance Jio	Vodafone-Idea	Airtel146864	4279	791771	597342	564744</pre>(Source: TARANG Sanchar Portal) #MTNL provide its service in Delhi and Mumbai only(b) 	Despite stiff competition, BSNL has managed to increase its subscriber base.  However, the customer base of MTNL has decreased marginally. Details of mobile subscribers of BSNL and MTNL   is as under:<pre>Name of PSU	No. of mobile subscribers as on (in crore)	31.03.2017	31.03.2018	31.03.2019BSNL	10.14	11.19	11.57MTNL	0.36	0.36	0.35</pre>(c) 	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of telecom service providers including BSNL and MTNL against the benchmark for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs).  As per PMR for mobile services issued by TRAI for the quarter ending September 2019, MTNL is meeting all the benchmarks for all the parameters.  BSNL is meeting all the benchmarks for all the parameters in all of its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) except for the parameter for call drops in West Bengal service area only.BSNL has reported that in West Bengal QoS of call drops is affected due to difficult terrain like hilly and forest area in Sikkim, Darjeeling, North Bengal area and isolated islands in Sundarban (South 24 Parganas).  Call handover becomes problematic due to shadow zones in hilly roads. There are frequent optical fibre cable cuts in major routes due to Highway expansion and augmentation of railway routes in North Bengal area.
