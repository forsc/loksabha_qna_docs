                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD) (a) to (c):	A statement showing the sanctioned strength and working strength of Subordinate Judiciary  is at Annexure-I.As per the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of judges in Subordinate Courts is the responsibility of the High Courts and State Governments concerned.  In so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States.The Supreme Court, through a judicial order in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary.  This order of January 2007 by the Supreme Court stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year.  The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions.  ****Annexure-ISTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1406 FOR ANSWER ON 10.02.2021 REGARDING SHORTAGE OF JUDGES IN SUBORDINATE JUDICIARYStatement showing the sanctioned strength and working strength of Subordinate Judiciary  as on 03.02.2021Sl.
