                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):	 In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share without any burden on the beneficiary. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganised workers after attaining the age of 60 years. This scheme is based on the 50:50 basis where 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution by the Central Government.******
