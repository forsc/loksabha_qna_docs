ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	The  Motor  Vehicles  (Amendment) Act, 2019 was  published  in  the Official Gazette on 09th August, 2019. Certain provisions have been implemented w.e.f. 01st September, 2019 vide S.O 3110 (E) dated 28.08.2019 and S.O 3147(E) dated 30.08.2019. For implementation of the rest of the provisions including section 51 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, rules are being formulated and will be published in due course of time. Section 51 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 provides for insertion of Section 162 which provides for the Central Government to make a scheme for the cashless treatment of victims of the road accident during the golden hour and such scheme may contain provisions for creation of a fund for such treatment.(b)	National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has prepared and circulated the standard operating procedure for rating of 4 and 6 lane national highways to all its offices for implementation. Three main categories i.e. Highway Efficiency (45%), Highway Safety (35%) and User Services (20%) have been formulated which are judged on the basis of 39 parameters The details of the parameters are annexed. The draft highway rating for 20,000 km has already been completed.(c)	Regarding rating of the Contractors, it may be mentioned that, to establish a transparent and comprehensive ‘Performance Rating’ System of the Contractors/ Concessionaires and Consultants engaged by NHAI, a Vendor Performance Evaluation System has been developed by NHAI. The portal for this is available on NHAI’s Website under the link ‘Vendor Performance Evaluation System’. With this, the accountability of the vendors will increase thereby improving the quality of the highways. Under this portal, the vendors are required to conduct a self-assessment and upload the related documents which shall be assessed in NHAI. The submissions are reviewed at multiple levels based on which a vendor rating is generated. The rating is shared with the vendor who has the opportunity to appeal against the generated rating to the Expert Committee. The portal contains provision for rating the projects according to the mode of implementation and status of completion under Build Operate & Transfer (BOT) (Toll), BOT (Annuity), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM), Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) works and for Authority Engineer, Independent Engineer & DPR Consultants. The Vendors have uploaded the details on the Portal for 1001 projects. The evaluation of the same is under process.(d)	NHAI ensures plantations and their maintenance on national highway’s available Right of Way (ROW) land. The plantation, transplantation, beautification and maintenance have been made core objectives of Green Highways Policy-2015. There are detailed IRC SP 21 2009 guidelines in place for highways landscaping, plantations and maintenance for protection, survival and good growth of trees by projects implementation through Concessionaires, State Forest Departments and other plantations agencies.(e)     The details of various projects as undertaken for the development of national highways in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are annexed.
