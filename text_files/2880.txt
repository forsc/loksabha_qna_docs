                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	As per the information shared by Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Solid Waste Management is one of the integral components of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [(SBM(G)]. The activities like collection, segregation and safe disposal of household garbage and safe disposal solutions for menstrual west (used sanitary cloths and pads) and  collection mechanisms, etc. can be taken up under this component. States have the flexibility to decide the technologies suitable to their local conditions and needs. SBM(G) guidelines provide for adoption of technologies related to maximum reuse of organic solid waste as manure such as vermi-composting/any other composting method, individual and community biogas plants, etc., and Gram Panchayats may create forward linkages with Blocks/Districts/private agencies where treatment of waste within the village is not possible. As per the information shared by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a State subject. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban(SBM-U) encourages Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to manage their garbage in scientific manner as prescribed under Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.	As reported by the ULBs/State Governments, the details of waste processing plants in the country are as under:                     SWM ProjectsType of Project	                                                 No. of ProjectsWaste to compost (with capacity of more than 5 TPD)	             690Waste to Electricity	                                               5Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF)/ Bio Gas etc.	                             109Metal Recovery Facility (MRF)	                                     323Construction & Demolition (C&D)	                                       6Total (as on 05.07.2019)	                                    1133Under construction/ UP-gradation ProjectsType of Project	                                                No. of ProjectsWaste to compost (with capacity of more than 5 TPD)	             332Waste to Electricity	                                              24Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF)/ Bio Gas etc.                	              40Metal Recovery Facility (MRF)	                                       3Construction & Demolition (C&D)	                                       3Total (as on 05.07.2019)	                                     402*****
