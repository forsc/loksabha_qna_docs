                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): “Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility for ensuring healthcare services including strengthening of Primary Healthcare system lies with respective State Governments.To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM).As per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres are to be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by December, 2022. The roll out plan of Ayushman Bharat - HWCs is given as below:•	FY 2018-19 = 15,000•	FY 2019-20 = 25,000 (Cumulative 40,000)•	FY 2020-21 = 30,000 (Cumulative 70,000)•	FY 2021-2022 = 40,000 (Cumulative 1,10,000)•	Till 31st December 2022 = 40,000 (Cumulative 1,50,000)Under Ayushman Bharat (AB-HWCs) provision of comprehensive primary care includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach for all. Services at AB-HWCs are free and universal to all individuals residing in the service area including mental health services. Besides expanding and strengthening the existing Reproductive and Child Health (RMNCHA+N) services and Communicable Diseases services, the functional AB-HWCs provide services related to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) (screening and management for NCDs such as Hypertension, Diabetes and 3 common cancers of Oral, Breast and Cervix) and incrementally adding other primary healthcare services for mental health, ENT, Ophthalmology, oral health, geriatric and palliative health care and trauma care etc.So far, approvals for above 1,50,115 Ayushman Bharat-Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs) have been accorded. Out of those, as reported by the States/UTs on the HWC Portal, 77,406 Health & Wellness Centres have been operationalized till 20th July, 2021 (State wise functional Health and Wellness Centres as on 20th July 2021 is given at Annexure).Central assistance released to the States/UTs under National Health Mission (NHM) since its inception during 2013-14 to 2020-21 is as follows:i.	FY 2013-14: Rs.17,407.39 croreii.	FY 2014-15: Rs.18,288.50 croreiii.	FY 2015-16: Rs.18,065.50 croreiv.	FY 2016-17: Rs.18,424.43 crorev.	FY 2017-18: Rs.25,465.28 crorevi.
