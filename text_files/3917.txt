                        Will the Minister of





TRIBAL AFFAIRS


                        be pleased to state:-















                                                    (a)	  the status of the  formulation of the National Tribal Policy;(b)	  whether the various stakeholders’ views have been received and the  status of this incorporation; and(c)	  the time-frame for the formulation of the said policy and its implementation status thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        (a)to(c)	Ministry of Tribal Affairs had prepared a draft National Tribal Policy in 2006.  This became out of context in view of certain legislative and policy changes and these necessitated further revision of the draft policy.  Meanwhile, a High Level Committee (HLC) was constituted on 14.08.2013 to prepare a position paper on socio-economic status of STs and suggest a way forward.  The Committee submitted its Report on 29.05.2014 which contains 108 recommendations cutting across various Central Ministries/Departments as well as State Governments. The recommendations were forwarded to Central Ministries/Departments of Govt. of India and State Governments to furnish their views/comments which are still awaited.  Thus the recommendations of the HLC are under consideration of the Government and no time frame has been fixed.*****
