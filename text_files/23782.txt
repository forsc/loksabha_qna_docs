ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) :	Item-wise details of India’s export of organic products, during each of the last three years, are at Annexure-I. As per the report published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture & the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) - “The World of Organic Agriculture Statistics and Emerging Trends 2020” – India’s share in world organic exports is less than 1 percent.(b & c):  Yes, Sir, while the export of organic products from India has been increasing, India’s share in global trade of organic food is still very low, due to following reasons:i.	Certified organic production in India is still quite low, bulk of which is being consumed in India, as the domestic demand for organic products is rising.ii.	The conditions for import of organic products are quite stringent in the major importing countries and imports are generally allowed only under bilateral equivalence agreements. (d) :	The promotion of exports of organic products is an ongoing process. The Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the administrative control of Department of Commerce, has been mandated with the export promotion of organic products. APEDA provides assistance to the exporters of organic products under various components of its export promotion scheme. APEDA also undertakes various activities to promote exports of organic products viz. addition of new products under NPOP, making efforts to get NPOP standards recognized by the importing countries, promoting ‘India Organic’ brand through participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions, organising Buyer-Seller Meets (BSMs), organising capacity building and outreach programmes etc.*******Annexure-ICategory Wise Organic Export for last 3 yearsQuantity in MT; Value in Rs, Lakh 	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20Sl.
