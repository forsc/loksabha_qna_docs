                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a)	to (d) :  The Government is encouraging Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to manage municipal solid waste in scientific manner including processing waste –to-compost and other process.  The Government has introduced a policy on promotion of City Compost wherein a Market Development Assistance (MDA) of Rs. 1500/- MT in the form of subsidy has been provided for scaling up production and consumption of city compost made out from city waste.   Initially, marketing and promotion of city compost was done through the existing fertilizer marketing companies. Subsequently to increase the volume of sale and to make compost available at affordable prices to farmers, compost manufacturers willing to market city compost were allowed for sale compost in bulk directly to farmers and claim MDA. The fertilizers companies have adopted 498 villages for promoting use of city compost. With the concerted efforts of the Government as well as fertilizer marketing companies/marketing entities, the production and sale of city compost has increased consistently over the years. The exact year-wise  production and sales position for the last four  years  is as under:                                                                                               ( in MT)Year 	       Production of      Sale by                Bulk Sale by                   Total sale                city compost 	  marketing companies 	 manufacturing companies  	2016-17	         196999.32	    96584.00	-	         -                        96584.002017-18	         338701.38	    123569.87	              75492.04	                  199061.912018-19	         363261.24	    195551.48	              111078.99	                  306630.472019-20	         327790.58	    215725.88  	              108872.57	                  324598.45 **********
