ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (c): India does not maintain any country specific import restrictions except for considerations like scientific, environmental, health & life of human, animal and plant. However, the assessments on the effectiveness of various remedial measures, including, restrictions taken to curb non-essential imports takes into account several factors such as existing domestic manufacturing capacities and its utilization, quality of imports, import intensity of exports, provisions of bilateral/multilateral agreements etc. (d)	to (g):  Adequate provisions exist to protect the Indian consumers from low quality and harmful imports, as imported goods are subject to domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms. In order to strengthen the implementation of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste in the country, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules,2016. Further, India has an elaborate and robust legal framework and institutional set up to protect its environment, life and health of its people, plants and animals. The BIS standards applicable to domestic goods are also applicable to imported goods. The Government on the recommendation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, had prohibited import of milk products including chocolate and chocolate products, candies/confectionaries/food preparations with milk from China due to the concerns regarding high melamine contamination in 2008, which has been extended vide DGFT notification dated 23.04.2019.*********
