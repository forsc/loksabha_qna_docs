                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Yes. The Government of India enacted the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994 and made rules thereunder for regulation of removal, storage and transplantation of human organs and tissues for therapeutic purposes and for the prevention of commercial dealings in human organs and tissues and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.  (b) & (c):	Few instances of human organ trade have come to the notice of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through complaints/media reports.  Under the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994 there is a State level Appropriate Authority to investigate any complaint of breach of any of the provisions of this Act or any of the rules made thereunder and take appropriate action. Accordingly, these cases are forwarded to the concerned State Government for investigation and taking action as per the provisions of the Act.  Further, details of such cases in not maintained by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.(d):	There is no such proposal to set up National Human Organ Donation Bank as organs like Heart, Kidney, etc. need to be transplanted immediately after retrieval. However, the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) has a facility of National Level Tissue Bank (Biomaterial Centre) for storing tissues. Under the National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP), a provision has been made for providing financial support to the States for setting up of Bio- material centre. As of now a Regional Bio-material centre has been established at Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO), Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Further, funds have been released to the State of Bihar and Maharashtra for establishment of Bio-material Centre under NOTP.(e):	The ‘National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO)’, ‘Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs)’ and ‘State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs)’ disseminate relevant information about organ donation in the public. A website www.notto.gov.in and a 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) have been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness and for imparting training to all those associated with transplant activities including doctors and transplant coordinators, such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day, seminars, workshops, debates, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkad natak, etc. are organized at different places in the Country. Advertisement in print media, audio-visual messages and talks to promote cadaver organ donation are also telecast on Doordarshan and other television channels from time to time.
