                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICUTLRURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????			                  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	At present, there are 725 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in the country. State wise number of KVKs including those in backward areas are given in Annexure-I.(b) 	As approved, additional KVKs have been established in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Madhubani, East Champaran, West Champaran and Gaya districts of Bihar.(c) 	A Third Party evaluation of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) has been carried out by National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development (NILERD), an autonomous institute under NITI Aayog, in 2015. The major observations and findings of this evaluation are as follows:- •	It was observed that KVKs are playing proactive role in transferring new technology at field level with beneficial impacts. •	The KVKs have an edge in technology transfer over other service providers by virtue of having better technical expertise and demonstration abilities. •	About 40 percent farmers reported that they implemented the technology immediately after its dissemination by KVK and that 25 percent did so from the next agricultural season. •	On an average a KVK covers 43 villages and 4300 farmers per year. 80% of villages covered are 10 km away from KVK.•	96% farmers’ requests were attended by KVKs.•	42% technologies adopted by farmers resulted in higher productivity, 33% resulted in high harvest income and 20% resulted in drudgery reduction.•	About 25% of persons trained started self-employment ventures.•	With the intervention by KVKs, about 80 percent of the farmers have modified their agricultural patterns which were related to diversification of crops and changes in cropping pattern, seed planting technique, use of fertilizers and pesticides, changes in machinery used and in water use pattern.Further, NILERD conducted categorization study of the KVKs on the basis of mandated activities, impact of the activities, allied activities, accolades and other parameters in 2018. The Study categorized the KVKs as A, B, C and D.  Best performing KVKs (43%) were rated as ‘A’ followed by 48% KVKs as ‘B’ and 9% as ‘C’ & ‘D’.  Besides, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) evaluated the KVKs in 2019. Major findings of the Study are as follows:•	KVKs’ efforts generated an additional net farm income of Rs. 3568 per hectare. •	Cost Benefit ratio is 1:7.8. Thus, the rate of return on expenditure on KVK is very high. •	One farmer trained by a KVK disseminates technology/knowledge to 30 fellow farmers.Recently in 2020, Indian Society of Agribusiness Professionals, New Delhi also conducted study on impact evaluation of KVKs. Major findings of the study are as follows:•	On an average, KVK outreach found to be around 90-100 villages. With its strong ICT interventions, the outreach to villages increases to even 200 villages per KVK.•	There is increase in outreach programs by KVKs from 2012-13 to 2019-20 in number of on farm trials by 51%, frontlines demonstrations by 61%, farmers trained by 16% and extension personnel trained by 35%.•	There is increase in proportion of farm women in trainings from 30% in 2012-13 to 37% in 2019-20.•	There is 142% increase in the number of short message sent from 2012-13 to 2019-20. Similarly, there is increase in the number of the farmers covered from the year 2012-13 to 2019-20 by 135% with the advent of the digital technologies such as Whats App group, Facebook group which has increased the outreach by 4 times.•	There is 32% increase in seed production and 117% increase in planting material production by KVKs during the said period.(d)	The KVKs conduct Frontline Demonstrations (FLDs) to establish the production potential of improved agricultural technologies on the farmers’ fields. The FLDs conducted on different pulse crops showed increase in production ranging from 29.51 % in chickpea to 38.64 % in green gram during 2020-21. Likewise, increase in production ranged from 25.89 % in mustard to 40.35 % in groundnut in oilseed crops. The average increase in production was 15.69 % in paddy, 12 % in wheat, 25.95 % in maize, 27.30 % in finger millet, 23.86 % in pearl millet, 47.10% in vegetables, 19.58% in fruits, 37.41% in flowers, 38.30% in spices/condiments, 17.46% in plantation crops, 32.74% in sugarcane, 8.38% in cotton, 29.52 % in berseem and 31.12 % in fodder maize.(e) 	State wise number of KVKs is given in Annexure-I.					***************
