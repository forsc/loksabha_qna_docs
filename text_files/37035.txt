ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARES???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	& (b):   In the year 2020, the Reassessment Committee of ICAR-IIOPR conducted a study to assess the potential area of Oil Palm cultivation in the Country including North Eastern States. As per the report of Reassessment Committee, a total 22 States have been identified with 27.99 lakh ha as having a potential area for Oil Palm cultivation in India including 9.62 lakh ha in North Eastern States. Oil Palm in India is not being promoted on forest lands. There is no proposal at present to exempt Oil Palm plantation from the definition of “non-forest purpose’’ through amendments to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.(c to e):Oil Palm is being promoted in the North Eastern Region under rainfed conditions. Under rainfed conditions, Oil Palm requires 1800 mm of rainfall at the rate of 150 mm per month. Even under irrigated conditions, rainfall is considered as an important parameter with 7% weightage since it contributes water supply in lieu of ground water at least during rainy period. As per ICAR-IIOPR, rainfall suitability classes have been categorized as >1000 mm (highly suitable), 601-1000 mm (moderately suitable) and <600 mm (not suitable) based on IMD rainfall data collected from historical normal (1950-2000) and minimum temperature data of ICAR-CRIDA for the period 1969-2000.*****
