The Scheme is in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan as it encourages setting up of new micro-enterprises using local raw material and rural workforce. The maximum cost of projects is Rs.25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs.10 lakh in the service sector with subsidy varying from 15% to 35% for different categories. Any individual can apply for PMEGP through online portal www.kviconline.gov.in.
