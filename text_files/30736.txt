                                                        THE FINANCE MINISTER(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****Statement as referred to in reply of Lok Sabha Starred Question no. *207 for answer on 13th December, 2021/ Agrahayana 22, 1943 (Saka) regarding “Establishment of NARCL” by SHRI SHANMUGA SUNDARAM K.,Hon’ble Member of Parliament(a) to (e):Pursuant to the Finance Minister’s Budget speech for the financial year 2021-22, National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) has been set up by banks and Certificate of Registration for commencement of business of securitisation of asset reconstruction operations has been granted by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4.10.2021. As per RBI data, aggregate gross advances of public sector banks (PSBs) increased from Rs. 18,19,074 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 52,15,920 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, aggressive lending practices during this period along with wilful default/loan frauds/corruption in some cases, economic slowdown etc. were observed to be primary reasons for the spurt in the stressed assets. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of NPAs. As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Primarily as a result of transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, as per RBI data on global operations, gross NPAs of PSBs rose from Rs. 2,79,016 crore as on 31.3.2015, to Rs. 8,95,601 crore as on 31.3.2018, and as a result of Government’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, have since declined to Rs. 6,12,384 crore as on 30.6.2021. Further, comprehensive steps have been taken by the Government to recover NPAs, enabled by which, PSBs, as per RBI data, have recovered an amount of Rs. 5,49,327 crore during the last seven financial years.NARCL is intended to resolve stressed assets amounting to about Rs.2 lakh crore. These assets include both fully and partially provided accounts. Acquisition of assets would be under the extant guidelines whereby through the 15:85 structure, 15 per cent of the net value of assets is paid upfront to banks and security receipts (SRs) issued for the remaining 85 per cent. Government has approved guarantee of up to Rs. 30,600 crore for Security Receipts to be issued by NARCL.  The said guarantee will be valid for five years from the date of issuance of SRs or till the date of final settlement of loan accounts, whichever is earlier.*****
