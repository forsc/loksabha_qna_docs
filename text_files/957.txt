                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a): The issue of checking corruption in the judiciary is to be addressed by the judiciary itself, as it is an independent organ under the Indian Constitution.

As per the “In-house procedure” Chief Justice of India is competent to receive complaints against the conduct of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justices of the High Courts.  Similarly, the Chief Justices of the High Courts are competent to receive complaints against the conduct of High Court Judges. Further, as per Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the control over District Courts and Courts subordinate thereto vests in the High Court.Complaints and representations regarding allegation of corruption received are dealt with by the Chief Justice of India or to the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court, as the case may be, for appropriate action.  Similarly, complaints / representations against member of Subordinate Judiciary received are forwarded to the Registrar General of the concerned High Court, for appropriate action.(b) As per the information made available by Delhi High Court, no judge of district courts is compulsorily retired during last three years due to corruption charges.(c): Does not arise in view of (a) above.
