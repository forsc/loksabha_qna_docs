                                                                 THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) :  Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities.  5,151 projects worth ? 2,05,018 crore were proposed by the 100 Smart Cities as part of their Smart City Proposals (SCPs). As on           12th  November 2021,  these Smart  Cities have tendered out 6,452 projects worth ? 1,84,998 crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 5,809 projects worth ? 1,56,571 crore; out of these, 3,131 projects worth ? 53,175 crore have been completed. Government of India has released ? 27,359.60 crore under SCM, out of which ? 22,467.81 crore has already been utilized. (b) to (d) : Since Land and Colonization are State subjects, it is the responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) to collect data, frame policies and implement schemes for developing slums. Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to address housing shortages including issues relating to slums. Under SCM, 23 Smart Cities have reported 41 slum re-development projects at an estimated cost of ? 3,009.6 crore.  The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) launched in June 2015 aims to provide all weather pucca houses to eligible urban beneficiaries by 2022. The ‘In-situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U addresses the issue of housing of slum dwellers. So far, 4.58 lakh slum households have been benefitted under the scheme. Repairs required, if any, to houses developed under the Scheme, are carried out by the beneficiaries themselves.                                    ****
