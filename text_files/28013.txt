During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected. It resulted in retarding the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses. Besides, the delays are also due to cases of unwillingness of beneficiaries, migration, death of beneficiaries without legal heir, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs and General/Assembly/Panchayat elections. The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G. Other steps taken including timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs under PMAY-G, provision of adequate funds and promotion of eco-friendly &innovative technologies for house construction, follow up with the States to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas, expeditious resolution of technical issues faced by the State.  Advisory was issued to all States/UTs to resume activities under PMAY-G with due Covid-19 protocol and regular review of progress at the level of Ministry to ensure timely completion of targeted houses. ***** AnnexureSTATEMENT IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3544 TO BE ANSWERED ON 10.08.2021 REGARDING HOUSES UNDER PM’S RURAL HOUSING PLANDetails of total number of houses built under PMAY-G vis a vis target fixed during the last three years, year-wise and State-wise including Gujarat:
