ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): 	No damage of Central Pool Foodgrains (wheat & rice) stored in godowns can be directly attributed to inadequate storage capacity. 		As on 31.08.2020, storage capacity available with FCI and State agencies for storage of Central Pool Foodgrain is 816.89 Lakh MT [FCI- 414.85 LMT (owned and Hired) and State Agencies -402.04 LMT] against the total stock of 700.27 Lakh MT.(c), (d), (e) & (f): 	The utilization of storage capacity depends upon the level of procurement, movement of foodgrains etc. and may differ from time to time. In procuring regions, the capacity utilization is maximum when procurement operations are going on but, subsequently, the stock is moved to deficit regions, which leads the storage capacity being surplus at micro level.  The storage capacity is periodically monitored to ensure optimal capacity utilization and in case of any storage gap, steps are taken to create additional storage capacity by hiring through various State agencies and private sectors.****
