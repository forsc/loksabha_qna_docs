(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR).(a):	 The Government is implementing a number of schemes for promoting sustainable agriculture. The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is one of the Missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The mission aims to evolve and implement strategies to make Indian agriculture more resilient to the changing climate.  NMSA was approved for three major components i.e. Rainfed Area Development (RAD); On Farm Water Management (OFWM); and Soil Health Management (SHM).Subsequently, four new programmes were introduced namely Soil Health Card (SHC), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern  Region (MOVCDNER) and  Sub Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF). During  2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was operationalised wherein the OFWM component of NMSA was subsumed under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY. In addition to aforementioned programmes under NMSA, Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched in April 2018. All these schemes that pertain to sustainable farming create source of livelihoods.(b):	 Evaluation of major Centrally Sponsored schemes implemented by the Department across the country was done by the NITI Aayog in 2020.  The report finds schemes relevant to address the needs of the sector. (c):	 Views of states/stakeholders are taken into account in formulation / operation of all the schemes of the DA&FW.*******
