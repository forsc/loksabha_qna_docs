                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Ministry has taken various steps to ensure timely payment of wages to workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). These include: (i)	Upscaling of National Electronic Fund Management System (Ne-FMS) in 24 States and 1 UT.(ii)	Intensive consultation with State Governments and other stakeholders to strategize timely payment of wages, verification of pending compensation claims etc.(iii)	Formulation of Standard Operating Procedure for monitoring of timely payment and payment of compensation.(iv)	Video conferences with States/ UTs reviewing the status of timely payment and payment of delay compensation. (c) to (e):	As per Schedule-I of the Act, wages are paid based on measurement of work done i.e. piece rate basis. Every State has its defined Schedule of Rates on the basis of which the work output is defined and used to calculate the wages for MGNREGA beneficiaries. The actual wage payable is calculated based on the output of the worker. The delay in payment of wages are due to implementation issues in the States which include inadequate staffing, non-timely recording and reporting of attendance, measurement, data entry, generation of wage list, Fund Transfer Order (FTO), etc.Efforts have been made by the Ministry to reduce the delay in payment of wages to the MGNREGA workers viz., timely release of funds, payment through National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) for direct payment of wages into workers account, issued guidelines for monitoring of timely payment and payment of delay compensation, enabling appropriate provisions in NREGASoft to monitor timely payment of wages and payment of delay compensation.  The Ministry is in constant engagement with the State Governments/ UTs through review meetings, video conferences, Mid Term Review, SMS based monitoring etc. to ensure timely payment of wages.*****
