                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI SHRIPAD YESSO NAIK) (a) to (d):      As health is a State subject, establishment  of Multispeciality Ayurvedic or Naturopathic hospitals in Naxal hit areas come under the purview of respective State/UT Governments. However, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM), there is a provision for providing Grant-in-aid to set up upto 50-bedded integrated AYUSH Hospital including Ayurveda and Naturopathy. Under NAM, grant-in-aid is being provided to State/UT Governments as per their proposed State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs). As far as proposal from the State Government of Bihar for establishing such integrated AYUSH Hospital at Jamui, Bihar is concerned, no such proposal has been received under NAM Scheme. Since, implementation of the programme comes under the purview of State/UT Governments, therefore it is required that proposal has to be submitted by the State Government through SAAP as per Scheme guidelines.………………….
