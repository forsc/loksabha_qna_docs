(e) whether DDA would make suitable changes for fast tracking the implementation of LPP to gather pace for planned development of Delhi as the policy was first notified in 2013 and if so, the details thereof; and (f) whether DDA has followed up with concerned departments to get all notifications in respect of this zone and also proposes to open portal for P-1 zone soon as the zone has been left behind under policy and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                          THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         ( SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)to (f)  Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has informed that all the 14 villages in P-1 zone have been declared as ‘Urban’ including Khera Kalan.  DDA has  taken up the matter of declaration of these 14 villages as ‘Development Area’ with the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD).  No fixed timeframe for completion of the process can be given as the process is to be completed by GNCTD. The process of implementation of land policy including opening of portal in P1 zone can be initiated only when these villages are notified both as ‘Úrban’ and ‘Development Area’. The present land policy and its regulations were notified on 11.10.2018 and 24.10.2018 respectively. There is no proposal at present to amend the Land Policy and its regulations.                                            *****
