ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (b)Yes, Sir.  Review of Model Concession Agreement (MCA) documents of various modes of road construction under PPP is a continuous exercise and changes are made to address the concerns of the stakeholders, as and when required. Considering the key challenges of PPP projects faced by stakeholders, following major changes have recently been made:(i)   BOT (Toll) Model: MCA for BOT(Toll) Model has been amended to reduce risk exposure for concessionaire through measures such as removal of capacity augmentation requirement for concessionaire, introduction of Dispute Resolution Board, changing bid parameter from Premium to Revenue Share, protection from the traffic variation risk by prescribing projected traffic at every 5-year interval during concession period. (ii)  Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM): MCA for HAM has been made investor friendly by modification of operation parameters such as increase in number of milestone payments, 100% exit allowance after 6 months (as compared to 2 years earlier), declaration of O&M expenditure in bid documents, introduction of dispute resolution board, protection of the concessionaires from interest rate risk by linking interest on balance annuities to average of one-year MCLR of TOP 5 Scheduled Commercial Banks plus 1.25 %. (c) A total length of 6722.31 Km has been completed out of 7245.07 Km   of NH projects under BOT (annuity) and BOT (Toll) mode. The details of ongoing NH projects at various stage of BOT (Toll/Annuity) are placed at Annexure. The delay in completion of projects is mainly on account of delay in acquisition of land, shifting of utilities, statutory clearances and the issue of availability of funds with the Concessionaire.(d)  During last five years and current financial year (upto Nov 21), private sector expenditure (Investment) is given as under:                                            (Rs. in cr.)Financial Year	Private sector Investment2016-17	15,453.642017-18	16,413.642018-19	21,605.322019-20	21,925.982020-21	12,475.532021-22 (upto Nov 2021)	15,164.25
