ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY	(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	Yes, Sir.(b)	Majority of the Indian Railway network is provided with Signalling systems suitable for speed up to 110 KMPH except for few sections suitable for 130 KMPH and Hajrat Nizamuddin – Agra section suitable for speed up to 160 KMPH. In advanced countries, majority of networks are provided with Signalling Systems for speed up to 250 KMPH to 300 KMPH.With the increasing demand for raising of speed of trains, along with more trains on existing network and to enhance Safety, additional Modern Signalling systems are required on Indian Railways.To match with the above requirements, additional signalling system are proposed to be provided as under, (i)	Automatic Train Protection (ATP) Systems.(ii)	Mobile Train Radio Communication (MTRC) Systems.(iii)	Remote Diagnostic & Predictive Maintenance systems.(iv)	Centralised Traffic Control (CTC)/Train Management Systems (TMS).(c)	Yes, Sir.(d)	Pilot projects on four Sections of lengths between 145 RKMs to 170 RKMs each, totalling 640 RKMs on Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonal routes have been taken up for trials of Modern Train Control System, as under:(i)	Nagpur – Badnera  		 -       175 KMs.(ii)	Renigunta - Yerraguntalla	 - 	165 KMs.(iii)	Vijainagram - Palasa 		 -       145 KMs. (iv)	Bina - Jhansi			 - 	155 KMs.(e)	In ETCS level-1 system, the updation of Movement Authority (permitted distance to travel by train) in the Loco is intermittent i.e. when the Loco negotiates a Signal, the Movement Authority is updated as per aspect of the Signal.  In case of ETCS level-2 system, the updation of Movement Authority is continuous, as movement authority to Loco is transmitted through a Radio System.  In case of ETCS Level-1, physical Signals are an essentially requirement. Whereas in case of ETCS level-2 system, physical signals are not essential.(f)	The expenditure involved to implement a system equivalent or comparable to ETCS level-2 and other associated systems in the entire rail network of the country shall be ? 77,912 Cr.  The Ministry is working on suitable mechanism for pooling resources for implementation of this system on entire rail network.*****
