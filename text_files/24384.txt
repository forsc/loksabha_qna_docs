                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA) (a) & (b):  Sir, Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of urea is Rs. 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable. Further, there is no increase in the price of the urea in recent past. For Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers, Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidised P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. The MRP of last 3 years for P&K fertilizers does not show much variation/increase which may be seen from Annexure–A. However, there was increase in the international prices of raw materials for manufacturing P&K fertilizers and finished P&K fertilizers in last few months of this year. Govt. of India has notified new NBS rates for P&K fertilizers vide. O.M. dated 20.05.2021 till Kharif season 2021 i.e. till Oct. 2021, wherein the subsidy on P&K fertilizers has been increased in order to keep the MRP of DAP and other P&K fertilizers more or less at the previous year’s rate in order to mitigate/minimize the adverse effect arising due to such increase in the international prices.(c) to (e) : Sir, the Govt. has no proposal to set up more factories to produce more fertilizers as the P&K fertilizer sector is de-controlled and P&K fertilizer companies run as per market dynamics.  ******
