ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) and (b)         Land for development of National Highways and associated purposes is acquired under Section 3 of the National Highways Act, 1956 and compensation is determined in accordance with the First Schedule of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013. Also, the provisions of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013, relating to rehabilitation and resettlement in accordance with the Second Schedule and infrastructure amenities in accordance with the Third Schedule have been made applicable to all cases of land acquisition under the National Highways Act, 1956, i.e. the enactment specified at Sr. No. 7 in the Fourth Schedule to the RFCTLARR Act, with effect from 01.01.2015.   	The provisions of Second and Third Schedule of the  RFCTLARR Act, 2013, in respect of acquisition of land for the construction/ expansion/ development of National Highways are attracted only where it leads to dislocation and displacement of an affected family from the affected area. Since acquisition of land for the required Right of Way (RoW) of a National Highway, causes minimal displacement and dislocation of the affected persons, all such affected persons due to such dislocation are rehabilitated as per the provisions of the Second Schedule of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013. However, before considering grant of any relief in terms of the Second Schedule, the Competent Authority Land Acquisition (CALA) has to unequivocally certify that the affected family has been displaced and dislocated to another area. The provisions of the Third Schedule are not at all attracted in these cases. (c)    Till date, there has been no requirement of rehabilitation of people due to development of NHs in Odisha. As such no rehabilitation has made during the last three years and the current year so far. *****
