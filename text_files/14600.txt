STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. * 294DUE FOR ANSWER ON 13.3.2020(a) & (b):	Duringrandom inspections conducted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), incidents of discharge of untreated or partially treated waste water by industries, without meeting the discharge norms, has been observed. To ensure that effluent discharges do not cause environmental damage or river pollution, industry specific effluent discharge standards are notified under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which are periodically reviewed from time to time by MoEF&CC. CPCB may mandate Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in large scale units present at environmentally sensitive or critical areas for controlling river pollution.The effluent generated from individual textile industries including dyeing and washing are treated at either individual Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) or through Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs).The Government through Ministry of Textiles is implementing the Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS) for enabling the textiles processing sector to meet environmental standards in the area of waste water treatment.(c) to (e):	Ministry of Textiles has not received any proposal to build waste management plants near textile industries; however, for the treatment of effluents discharged by textile units in processing sector, the Government is implementing the Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS) under which both brownfield and greenfield CETPs are established under Public Private Partnership mode.The project cost shall be borne by the Centre, State and Beneficiary (Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) which will be a Non-profit Company registered under the Companies Act) in the ratio of 50:25:25 respectively.  Government of India grant is provided within the overall ceiling of 50% of the project cost not exceeding Rs.75 crore for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Marine discharge and Rs. 10 crore for riverine and conventional treatment as the case may be. Proposals of CETP are also considered in Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) under “Common Infrastructure” being implemented by this Ministry. So far Government has sanctioned 7 Projects under the Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS) for setting up/ upgrading Common Effluent Treatment plants (CETPs) with Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems, which may be seen at Annexure.
