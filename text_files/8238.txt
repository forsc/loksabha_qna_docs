MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)to (e) A statement has been laid on the Table of the House.    ***** Statement referred to in reply to part (a) to (e) of LokSabha Starred Question No.174 due for reply on 29.11.2019 by Shri Ramesh Bidhuri&Shri Rajiv Ranjan Singh Alias Lalan Singh regarding Tree Plantation Programme(a)	Yes Sir,tree plantation is necessary for protection of environment as well as for water harvesting. Forests and trees are important formaintaining hydrological cycle, help in recharging the aquifers,reducing runoff, and maintainthe flow of water in rivers and streams. Tree plantationsalso help in reducing global warming by absorbing the greenhouse gases, checkssoil erosion, aidspollution reduction and maintains biodiversity and ecological balances.(b)	to (e) Government provides financial support to various states to take up tree plantation programmes. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Changeimplements two major afforestation schemes namely National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests through people’s participation and National Mission for a Green India (GIM), for plantation on landscape basis. An area over 2 million hectare was sanctioned for afforestation with an investment of about Rs.3874 crore under NAP since its launching year 2000.  Under GIM, an amount of about Rs. 300 crore has been released for preparation of bridge plan and implementation of perspective plan since 2011-12 to 2018-19. In the current financial year an amount of Rs. 128 crores has been allocated for NAP and GIM. The state-wise details of total funds provided under NAP and GIM during the last three years is given in Annexure. In addition, this ministry also encourages plantation/afforestation through people’s movement under School Nursery Yojana and Nagar Van UdyanYojana. An amount of Rs.1.54 crore (for 505 school nurseries)&Rs. 51.24 crore (for 46 Nagar van udyans)respectivelyhave been released under the schemes. Besides, the funds collected under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), as compensatory levies from states inter-alia, is also used in plantation activity including compensatory afforestation by States/UTs. Government of India has disbursed an amount of Rs.47,436 crore from National Fund to 27 State funds as share of respective states as per Compensatory Fund Act, 2016 the state-wise details of which is given in Annexure II.Further, tree plantation, being a multi-departmental, multi-agency activity,are also being taken up cross-sectorallyunder various programmes/funding sources of other ministries such as MGNREGA, PradhanMantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana(PMKSY), Agro-forestry Mission, National Bamboo Mission and also through state plan budget.Besides central tree plantation/afforestation schemes, all State governmentsincluding Bihar, choose their own specific tree plantation programme based on need & budget availability for implementation, such as mass plantation drive involving public participation, theme based plantation, externally aided projects etc. MoEF&CC coordinates and monitors the afforestation /Tree Plantations activities, across various States and agencies in the country and also issues advisories/directiveson various occasions like World Environment Day, Van Mahotsav, World Forestry Day etc. to all the State/UT Governmentsto take up tree plantation under various schemes, and on all available vacant land within and outside forest areas. The ministry is the nodal organization for fixing of afforestation/tree plantation targets annually under Twenty Point Programme. This year also MoEFCChas issued directives to all the states,including NCT of Delhi, to take up large scale plantation with main focus in drought affected areas, preferably in the micro catchments and vacant lands with plantations of local indigenous plants suitable for conservations and percolation of water. MoEF&CC has also advised States to involve communities, educational institutions and local bodies in afforestation plan.*****
