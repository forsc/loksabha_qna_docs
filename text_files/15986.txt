                                                         ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):   ‘Public Health’ being a State subject, no such data is centrally maintained.However, As per available literature, it is known that pollution is related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) cases coupled with increased asthma attack in the country.(c) to (e):     As per the Constitutional provisions, ‘Health’ is a State subject. However, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provides financial and technical assistance to States / Union Territories (UTs) under the National Health Mission (NHM) for strengthening of Primary and Secondary health care facilities to effectively respond to health care needs. Under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), additional manpower, training of identified Rapid Response Team members for outbreak investigations, strengthening of laboratories for detection of epidemic prone diseases, information technology equipment for data entry, analysis and data transfer, and provision of funds for operationalization, etc. are provided to prevent the spread of disease outbreaks.In January 2019, Government launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) to tackle the problem of air pollution in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024, keeping 2017 as base year. The overall objective is to augment and evolve effective ambient air quality monitoring network across the country besides ensuring comprehensive management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution and enhancing public awareness and capacity building measures. The plan includes 102 non-attainment cities, across 23 States and Union Territories, on the basis of their ambient air quality data between 2011 and 2015 and World Health Organization (WHO) report 2014/2018. A total of 86 city specific action plans have been approved for ground implementation.       In view of probable linkage of Respiratory illnesses with deteriorating Air Quality Index (AQI), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has also initiated following activities:•	Initiation of daily Sentinel surveillance for Acute Respiratory Illnesses in Emergency Department of Central Government Hospitals•	Providing feedback to hospitals for undertakings appropriate measures for managing respiratory illnesses in their hospitals•	Issuing Health advisory on health effects of Air Pollution to Health department of all States.
