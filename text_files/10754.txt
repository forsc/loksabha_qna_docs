Further, the officers and staff of CDSCO are regularly sensitized in this context. Security of the CDSCO Offices has been strengthened with installation of CCTV cameras at all strategic points to keep a watch over the visitors. Various measures have also been taken for improving transparency and accountability in the system. As part of E-Governance and to reduce human interface, CDSCO has launched a portal www.cdscoonline.gov.in exclusively for filing of applications for their processing and tracking.      Further, action in all such cases is taken as per existing rules, procedures and guidelines.
