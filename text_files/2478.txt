ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued circulars dated 13.11.2017(https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/6193093_Psychosocial-Study-of- Ragging.pdf) and27.12.2018 (https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/3405363_Anti-ragging-Circular.pdf)recommending urgent and mandatory Psychosocial Support and counselling to beoffered to victims as well as perpetrators so that the potential for cyclical abuse isneutralized. As per the recommendation of the Committee on “Psychosocial Study ofRagging in Selected Educational Institutions in India”, there is a provision for providingfree medical and psychiatric counselling to victims of ragging in each college. Theserecommendations are mandatory and all institutions are required to take necessarysteps for its implementation. The Anti Ragging Committee of the College counsels eachstudent who is a victim of ragging and if the Committee feels that the student victimrequires professional counselling then he/she is referred to the counsellor in the College.(c) & (d): UGC has not received any complaints, so far, regarding underfunding orunder staffing of college Anti Ragging Cells. Therefore, the question of taking remedialmeasures does not arise.****
