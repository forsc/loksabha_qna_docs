ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) State/UT wise details of total number of forest fire cases with estimated loss during the current year are given in Annexure.(b) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has prepared a National Action Plan on Forest Fire in April 2018 after several rounds of consultation with all the States and UTs. The objective of this Plan is to minimize forest fires by informing, enabling and empowering forest fringe communities and incentivizing them to work in tandem with the State Forest Departments. The Plan also intends to substantially reduce the vulnerability of forests across the diverse forest ecosystems in the country against fire hazards, enhance the capabilities of forest personnel and institutions in fighting fires, and speed up recovery after a fire event.The Ministry is the nodal ministry for disaster management caused by forest fire, water pollution and hazardous substances in the country. Nodal Officers for forest fire prevention and control have been appointed in all States/UTs. A Crisis Management Committee has been constituted in the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Secretary. For the supervision and review of forest fire management, a Central Monitoring Committee has been constituted in the ministry under the Chairmanship of Secretary. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of all States and Union Territories are members of this Committee. Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry disseminates the satellite-based forest fire alerts to the State Forest Departments and other registered mobile users whenever forest fires are detected. Till date around 69,000 users have been registered to receive the fire alerts from FSI. Since forests are managed by the States/UTs, the responsibility of forest fire prevention and management lie primarily with the respective State/UT Governments. The Ministry supports the efforts of State/UT Governments in prevention and control of forest fire by providing financial assistance for various forest fire prevention and management measures under the Centrally Sponsored Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme. Accordingly, State/UT Governments prepare Annual Plan of Operation for prevention and management of forest fire and funds are released.In addition to above, funds are provided to the States/UTs for capacity building, providing appropriate firefighting equipment to forest fire fighting squads and activities for forest fire management under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules 2018.                           *****
