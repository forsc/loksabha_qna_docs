                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	to (d) To preserve and protect Western Ghats, this Ministry had set up the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) under the Chairmanship of Prof. Madhav Gadgil for recommending measures for the conservation and environmental integrity of the Western Ghats to promote sustainable development of the region. Considering large scale objections to the report submitted by WGEEP, a High Level Working Group (HLWG) under the Chairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan was constituted by this Ministry to examine the WGEEP Report in a holistic manner and recommend measures for the protection of the Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) of Western Ghats.Based on the recommendation of HLWG, to provide immediate protection to the ESA of the Western Ghats, the Government issued Directions under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 on 13.11.2013. As per the Directions, the five categories of new and/or expansion projects/activities having maximum interventionist impact on ecosystems namely (i)   Mining, quarrying and sand mining (ii)   Thermal Power Plants (iii)   Building and construction projects of 20,000 square meters area and above (iv) Township and area development projects with an area of 50 hectares and   above and /or with built up area of 1,50,000 square meters and above and (v) Red category of industries are prohibited in the ESA of Western Ghats. Further, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC) had issued draft Notification vide S.O. 733 (E) dated 10.02.2014, with an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) of 56,825 square kilometres, in the States of Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  The draft Notification was subsequently republished thrice, vide S.O. 2435 (E) dated 04.09.2015; S.O. 667 (E) dated 27.02.2017 and S.O. 5135 (E) dated 03.10.2018 with same ESA area.  Due to persistence demand from the states to reduce/alter the ESA area from the recommendation of the HLWG, the draft Notification could not be finalised.(e) to (f) No case of encroachment in the Ecologically  Sensitive Area is reported by the state Government to this Ministry. ***
