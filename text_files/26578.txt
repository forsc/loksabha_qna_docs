The CBI has registered Preliminary Enquiry on 18.02.2021 against Unknown Public Servant(s) and Private Person(s) in this regard.(c): 	No report in this regard has been received from CBI......2/--2-(d): 	Does not arise in view of (c) above.(e): 	The following initiatives/measures are taken to by the Government to improve the situation:  i) 	Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) has been implemented across the country. DBT of MSP has brought in responsibility, transparency, real time monitoring and reduces pilferage in the system. DBT eliminates fictitious farmers and reduce the diversion and duplication of payment as payment is made directly to farmer’s bank account which in many States is linked with Aadhaar number of the farmers. DBT to farmers in Punjab for procurement of foodgrains has been started from Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2021-22.   ii)	FCI and most of the State Governments have developed their own online procurement system which ushers in transparency and convenience to the farmers through proper registration and monitoring of actual procurement. The online procurement system has largely eliminated the procurement from middlemen and has resulted in better targeting of the MSP to farmers. iii) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. iv) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. v) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.Moreover, the State Government Punjab has informed that the State Government in coordination with State Police Department had deputed police teams at all States barriers to keep a strict vigil and curb illegal entry of recycled paddy/rice from other States to the State of Punjab during KMS 2020-21. Accordingly, 90 FIRs were registered against those indulging in malpractices, 160 trucks & trolleys carrying paddy from other States were impounded, 17 licenses of arthiyas and 3 licenses of rice millers were suspended across the State. ***
