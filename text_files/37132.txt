ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (c):  Coal companies have been taking up various projects for development of coal industry from their internal resources/market borrowings and there is no budgetary support by Government of India for these projects. 	However, there is a sub-scheme namely, "Development of Transportation Infrastructure in Coalfield Areas (DTIC)" under Central Sector Scheme (CSS) of "Conservation, Safety and Infrastructural Development in Coal Mines" to give financial assistance for development of transportation infrastructure in coal fields. This is not state-specific scheme and funds are granted to coal companies directly. An amount of Rs. 50.04 Crores has been allocated for the year 2022-23. Further, during 2021-22, Rs. 65.48 Crores was allocated for this purpose, out of which Rs. 58.22 Crores has been released.****
