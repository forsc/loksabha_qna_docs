ANSWER




                                                        (a)	No, Sir. Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of major ports is an ongoing process. The process inter-alia involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting large vessels in port channels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. As a result, the cargo handling capacity of the major ports has been steadily going up. The installed capacity of the major ports as on 31.3.2019 is 1514.09 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) which is sufficient to handle the existing cargo traffic at the major ports. The traffic handled by the major ports during 2018-19 was 699.09 million tonnes (MT). Significant improvement in efficiency has been achieved by the major ports in the last three years.  With a view to further improve the efficiency and productivity of the major ports and make it comparable internationally, a benchmarking study of Major Ports to international standards has been conducted which has recommended 116 initiatives  out of which 95 have already been implemented.(b)	Yes Sir.  Transshipment of Indian import and export containers has been taking place primarily at foreign ports. This is due to shortage of Indian flagged container vessels and unavailability of deep draft ports, as a result of which large container vessels do not call at Indian ports.  In order to boost transshipment at Indian ports, this Ministry under the provisions of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 relaxed  cabotage for foreign vessels for coastal movement of EXIM transshipment containers and Empty containers in May, 2018. Whereas,  0.27 million TEUs were transshipped at Indian ports in 2017-18, the number went up to 0.35 million TEUs in 2018-19 reflecting a growth of 29.62%. Against this, 5.58 million TEUs & 6.12 million TEUs were transshipped at foreign ports in 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively which shows  a growth of 9.67% only.(c)	There are 12 major ports and around 200 non-major ports in the country along India’s Coastline which is about 7500 km. in length. Ports handle around 95% of the EXIM trade by volume in the country. However, the information regarding share of Indian ports in total maritime trade in Indian Ocean region in 2019 is not maintained in this Ministry.                                      *****
