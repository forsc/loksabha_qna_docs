ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors and is generally constant. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing progressively due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters, 1367 cubic meters, 1282 cubic meters and 1228 cubic meters in the years 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051 respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meters is considered as water stressed condition, whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability of many regions of the country is much below the national average and may result in water stress / scarce conditions. (b) to (e) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to solve water related problems in the country.Contd…P/2//2//Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement. This will help people to work for rain water harvesting, maintenance and upkeep of ponds and village tanks and conservation of water.Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. Through National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), a centrally sponsored scheme, technical and financial assistance are provided to States for providing safe drinking water in rural areas. The NRDWP has been restructured to make it more competitive, result oriented and outcome based to reduce the slippages and inefficiencies in the rural drinking water supply.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. The water supply component includes augmentation of existing water supply system and water treatment plants; rehabilitation of old water supply system; rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water etc. The Ministry has also issued guidelines “Guidelines for Urban Water Conservation” to all the States/UTs to undertake water conservation measures.A meeting of the State Ministers in-charge of Water Resources, Water Supply and Sanitation was held on 11th June 2019 to review the steps taken by various States on water conservation and the implementation of action plans for dealing with the water supply situation, plan for water harvesting and conservation in convergence with other programmes. The need to integrate various water conservation efforts like point recharge, de-silting of minor irrigation tanks, use of grey water for agriculture and ensuring sustainability of the sources was discussed. State Governments were requested to complete water conservation measures so that large-scale rain water harvesting could be possible in the upcoming monsoon season.Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control ground water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
