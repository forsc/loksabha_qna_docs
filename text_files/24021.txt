RCS - UDAN is a market driven Scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.Patahi airport at Vaishali in Bihar does not figure in the tentative list of unserved/underserved airports of RCS- UDAN Scheme document. If the Government of Bihar requests the Ministry of Civil Aviation for inclusion of Patahi airport in the RCS document, the same could be included for bidding by prospective airlines in future rounds of bidding.
