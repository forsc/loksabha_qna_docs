                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): 	MIS and PM-AASHA of which PSS is one of the component are continuing scheme for supporting procurement of pulses,  oilseeds and copra at MSP within the parameters of guideline. Central Government has provided a guarantee of more than Rs.40,000 crore to Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) for accessing credit to conduct the procurement operations.  Budgetary funds are provided to meet any losses incurred in such procurement operations as per requirement. The indicative budgetary estimates are based on previous years demand of the schemes. This estimate gets revised as per the actual requirement.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that the allocation has been reduced.(d):    Under Price Support Scheme (PSS), Government agencies procure the notified pulses, oilseeds and copra of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) at Minimum Support Price (MSP) directly from farmers on the request of concerned State Governments / Union Territories as prescribed in the scheme guideline . All the payments of MSP value of such procured crops are made by the procuring agencies directly into farmers’ accounts.*****
