                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c): Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been implementing Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) to create modern infrastructure for the food processing industries since 2008. This scheme is now a component of the new Central Sector Umbrella Scheme – Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). The Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) aims at providing modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market.Government has accorded approval for setting up 42 Mega food Parks in  the country and presently 37 Mega Food Parks approved by the Ministry are under various stage of implementation. Out of these, a total of 18  Mega  Food  Park projects at Haridwar (Uttarakhand), Chittoor (Andhra Pradesh), Tumkur (Karnataka), Fazilka (Punjab), Nalbari (Assam), Khargone (Madhya Pradesh), Murshidabad (West Bengal), Rayagada (Odisha), Satara (Maharashtra), Ajmer (Rajasthan), Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand), Surat (Gujarat), Aurangabad (Maharashtra), Una (HP), West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh),  West  Tripura (Tripura), Nizamabad (Telangana) and Dewas (Madhya Pradesh) have been made operational. Amongst these operational Mega  Food  Parks,  2  projects  at Nizamabad (Telangana) and Dewas (Madhya Pradesh) have been made operational during current financial year.Ministry does not establish Mega Food Parks in the country on its own. The proposals under Mega Food Park Scheme for setting up of Mega Food Parks in the country are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) from time  to  time. Presently, Ministry has invited EoI/proposal under this Scheme for filling up the vacant slots with the last date of submission of proposals as 31.03.2020.As per Mega Food Park scheme guidelines, each Mega Food Park on being fully operational with units would benefit about 25,000 farmers. Details of actual farmers benefited from the 18 operational Mega Food Parks projects are at Annexure.*****
