ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (e) : 	As per data provided by the power sector Generating companies, on the PRAAPTI Portal, at the end of February, 2022, a total amount of Rs.1,00,931 Crore is due from the DISCOMs. The details of the same are placed at Annexure-I. 	    	The Government of India have made several interventions to improve financial and operational efficiencies of DISCOMs linked to reform measures including Liquidity Infusion Scheme (LIS); Additional Borrowing of 0.5% of GSDP to States linked to power sector reforms; introducing additional prudential norms for lending by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) Limited and REC Limited based on performance of utilities; and Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS). Further, the Government had also issued an order dated 28th June, 2019 enforcing opening and maintaining of adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as payment security mechanism under Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by Distribution Licensees. The order mandates NLDC & RLDC to dispatch power only after it is intimated by GENCO & DISCOM confirming opening of LC. These reform measures will improve the financial health of DISCOMs which will improve the liquidity situation leading to reduction in outstanding dues to Power Generating companies (GENCOS).Based on the information available in the “Report on Performance of State Power Utilities 2019-20” published by Power Finance Corporation (PFC),  State-wise details of ACS-ARR Gap on Tariff Subsidy received basis (excluding Regulatory Income and UDAY Grant) and accumulated losses of all DISCOMs (State-wise) in the country are attached as Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively.**********
