ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) The BRGF (District component) was applicable in 272 identified backward districts in all States of the country except Goa during the period 2006-07 to 2014-15. Consequent upon the implementation of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, share of States in the net proceeds of the Union taxes has been significantly enhanced from 32% to 42% of the Centre’s net tax receipts. Hence, BRGF Programme has been delinked from the budgetary support of the Central Government since 2015-16. Therefore, no fund has been released to the State Governments under this Programme during the last three years and the current year.		For monitoring the works/ projects undertaken under the BRGF Programme, MoPR prescribed auditing of Panchayats funds/works. BRGF Guidelines also provided for audit of works through a Review Committee at District Level and Social Audit and Vigilance at the Panchayat levels.		Under the District component of Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) Programme implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) from 2006-07 to 2014-15, two (2) districts of Kerala namely, Palakkad and Wayanad were covered.*****
