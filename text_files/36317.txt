                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) : 		Several initiatives have been taken in the area of capacity addition for power generation and transmission along with reforms in the distribution sector, which are briefly mentioned as under:•	The total installed power generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, in the country as on 28.02.2022 is 395.6 GW. A total of 106.63 GW power generation capacity has been added during the last five years and current year (up to 28.02.2022), from conventional and renewable energy sources.•	All regional grids are synchronously connected and the power transmission capacity in Inter State Transmission Systems (ISTS) is adequate for free flow of power in different directions resulting in “One Nation – One Grid – One Frequency”.  At present, the inter-regional transmission capacity of the National Grid is about 112,250 MW (76,300 MW added since April, 2014). •	Government of India had launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) in December, 2014 for rural electrification works across the country. As reported by the States, all the inhabited un-electrified villages as per Census 2011, stand electrified as on 28th April, 2018 across the country under DDUGJY. •	Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) was launched in October, 2017 with the purpose of electrification of the remaining unelectrified households in rural and urban areas. Under the Saubhagya scheme, as on 31.03.2021, all the States have reported 100% electrification of all the willing un-electrified households, identified before 31.03.2019.  Since the launch of Saubhagya scheme, 2.817 Crore households were electrified across the country up to 31.03.2021.•	Government of India has launched a Reforms-based and Results-linked ‘Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme’ on 20.07.2021 with an objective of providing quality, reliable and affordable power to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient Distribution Sector. The scheme has an outlay of Rs.3,03,758 Crore and an estimated Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) from Central Government of Rs.97,631 Crore. (b) :		During the last five years from 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2021, a total of 1,00,270 ckm of transmission lines (220 kV and above) have been added in the country. The State-wise details of transmission capacity addition and funds sanctioned/spent for transmission schemes (220 kV & above) during the last five years are given at   Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.(c) : 		Sufficient transmission capacity has been planned in the country for evacuation of power from generating stations to the load centres including strengthening of existing transmission system. 12719 Ckm of Transmission lines and 69592 MVA of Transformation capacity have been installed against the target of 19255 Ckm and 81545 MVA respectively, for the Year 2021-22 (up to 28.02.22). In the next 3 years, it is targeted to add about 17,500 Ckm of Transmission Lines per year and 80,000 MVA of Transformation Capacity per year on all India basis.
