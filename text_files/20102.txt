                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	to (d): The Government of India had notified certain changes in the  import policy of peas and pulses in light of various developments in the sector. These Notifications were challenged in various High Courts. Based on ex -parte stay orders against the operations of these Notifications, certain importers brought in quantities of pulses in excess of the stipulations for the years 2017 -18, 2018 -19 and 2019 -20. The Government contested the cases before various High Courts and in order to obtain a common judgment, sought transfer of all cases filed before the various High Courts to the Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated 26th August, 2020 upheld the notifications and the trade notices and rejected the challenge made by the importers and further directed that the imports, if any, made relying on interim order(s) would be held to be contrary to the notifications. The disposal of peas and pulses stocked at various sea ports which have been imported by private importers in violation of the Foreign Trade Policy and notifications issued there under, will be in accordance with and subject to the Judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the relevant provisions of law. A statement indicating port wise quantity of food grains, peas and pulses lying at various ports pending clearance by Customs Authorities is at Annexure - I.
