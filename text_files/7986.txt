Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.142 due for reply on 28.11.2019.(a): State/UT wise number of rural households with access to toilets as reported by the States/UTs on the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen [SBM(G)]is given at Annexure-I. (b) to (d):   No Universal Sanitation Coverage Survey has been published by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation. However, in order to ensure sustainability of ODF status and to ensure that no one is left behind, the Government has advised all the States/UTs including Uttar Pradesh to identify if any rural households have been missed out. Subsequently, many States have undertaken special drives to identify such missed out households and all the States have been encouraged to provide the necessary support to these households to construct toilets.
