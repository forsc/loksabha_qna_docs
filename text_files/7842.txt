ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a & b)     NLC India Limited (NLCIL) had proposed to establish a coal based Thermal Power Project of 3960/4000 MW in two phases at Sirkali in the District of Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu. Talabira II & III coal blocks in the State of Odisha was allotted to NLCIL for meeting the coal requirements of NTPL (a subsidiary company of NLCIL) and the Sirkali Power Project. The Sirkali Power Project was conceived in 2010, Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) was signed in 2011 and land was not sanctioned. In the changed scenario, when the merit order generation is emerging as a market imperative, demanding cost competitiveness on the part of a power generator to produce / provide cheaper power, it was felt that establishment of a pithead power station of equal capacity (4000 MW) in the vicinity of Talabira Mines in Odisha would avoid transportation of huge quantum of coal for a long distance and thereby reducing the cost of generation of power. Accordingly, power project at Sirkali was dropped at the initial stage only.  (c)        No, Sir. (d)         Does not arise in view of (c) above.  * * * *
