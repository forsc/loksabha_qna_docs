ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	Yes, Sir. Under the Scheme of Special Dispensation Admission, each Hon’ble Member of Parliament (MP), Lok Sabha can refer 10 (ten) cases for admission in an academic year but such recommendations shall be confined to children whose parents belong to his/her constituency either by domicile or on account of having been soon-before posted there or else on account of exigencies of service, migrate to his/her constituency. Such recommendations would be for admissions in Kendriya Vidyalaya(s) (KVs) located in his/her constituency only. In case there is no KV in the constituency of the Hon’ble MP (Lok Sabha), he/she may recommend these admissions in the KV(s) located in any neighbouring contiguous constituency. For Hon’ble MPs of the Rajya Sabha, the State from which the member has been elected would be deemed to be his/her constituency for this purpose. Nominated Members of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha can recommend 10 (ten) cases for admission in any one or more KVs of the country. <pre>i)	These admissions shall be over and above the class strength. ii)	These recommendations would be made for classes I to IX only. iii)	These admissions would be made at the beginning of the academic year and no admission would be allowed after the prescribed cut-off date of the year. iv)	The recommendations to be made shall be valid only if these are made in the prescribed format provided to each Member of Parliament by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). v)	The children recommended by Hon’ble Members of Parliament must be otherwise eligible for admission as per the extant KVS Admission Guidelines.(b)	No such proposal is under consideration at present.(c)	Does not arise.</pre>*****
