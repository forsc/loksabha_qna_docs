The group urged Parties, that have not yet ratified the Doha Amendment (second commitment period) to do so as soon as possible, striving for its prompt entry into force before the 25th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Group also urged developed countries to take urgent actions to close the gaps, including revisiting their targets on mitigation under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and fulfilling their commitments of providing support to developing countries. *****
