                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):	India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereon. All foreign nationals (including refuge seekers) are governed by the provisions contained          in  The Foreigners Act, 1946, The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, The -2-L.S.US.Q. NO.3593 FOR 10.08.2021Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and The Citizenship Act, 1955, and rules and orders made thereunder.     Foreign nationals who enter into the country without valid travel documents are treated as illegal migrants. Since illegal migrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in clandestine and surreptitious manner, accurate data regarding number of such migrants living in the country is not centrally available.       There are reports about some rohingya migrants indulging in illegal activities.        Central Government has issued instructions to State Governments / UT Administrations advising them to sensitize the law enforcement and intelligence agencies for taking appropriate steps for prompt identification of illegal migrants, their restriction to specified locations as per provisions of law, capturing their biographic and biometric particulars, cancellation of fake Indian documents and for taking legal proceedings including initiation of deportation proceedings as per provisions of law. Consolidated instructions to tackle the issue of overstay and illegal migration of foreign nationals have also been issued on 30.03.2021.*****
