ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b) 	Telecom Service Providers are installing towers/Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) as per the techno-commercial viability and fulfilling the rollout obligation criteria in the service area, as per the License conditions.	Multiple factors such as inability to install additional BTSs on existing Towers due to loading issues, opposition from local residents due to perceived fear of EMF (Electro-Magnetic Field) radiation, non-availability of suitable structure at various places, inaccessible terrain and transportation difficulties of equipment at various locations, and unwarranted delays in commissioning new sites due to various procedural formalities from local administration/ agencies, limit the feasibility of tower installation.(c) 	There is no mandatory limit set by Government on spending by private telecom operators on their infrastructure and normally the spending on infrastructure is decided by their business requirement.(d) 	In order to address the difficulties being faced by the Telecom Service Providers, Infrastructure Providers and Telecom Companies with various States/ Union Territories and Concerned Central Government Departments/ Agencies in creation of underground and over ground telecom infrastructure on account of multiple right of way related issues and exorbitant charges, the Government of India notified Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules – 2016 in November 2016. These rules govern the Right of Way procedures for setting up towers and laying fibers across the country.************
