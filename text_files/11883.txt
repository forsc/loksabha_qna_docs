Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability of many regions of the country is much below the national average and may result in water stress / scarce conditions.(b) to (d) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes.During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (PMKSY-AIBP), having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectare, have been prioritized for completion in consultation with States.
