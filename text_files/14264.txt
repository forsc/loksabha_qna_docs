ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) Promotion of specific sports discipline is the responsibility of the concerned National Sports Federation (NSF). For promotion and development of sport of Football at national level the Government has recognized All India Football Federation (AIFF) as the NSF. The Government supplements the efforts of AIFF by providing financial assistance for training and participation of Indian teams in international tournaments abroad, holding of national and international tournaments in India, purchase of equipment, training of national teams/sportspersons under Indian and foreign coaches with requisite technical & scientific back up. The sport of Footballhas been placed in the “Priority” category so that it gets maximum assistance under the Scheme of Assistance to the NSFs.Further, Khelo India Scheme, launched in 2017 aims at infusing sports culture and achieving sporting excellence in the country. Football has featured in all three editions of Khelo India Youth Games and First Khelo India University Games, 2020.(b) to (e) ‘Sports’ being State subject, responsibility for promotion and development of sports rests with the concerned State / UT Governments. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the concerned State Government to develop sports infrastructure by bridging the critical gaps under Khelo India Scheme, which deals with sports infrastructure. At present no proposal relating to development of world class football infrastructure in the Andhra Pradesh is under consideration of the Central Government.****
