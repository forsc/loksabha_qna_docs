ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): 	Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities pertain with the State/UT. Accordingly, as and when complaints are received in this Department from individuals, organizations as well as through media reports regarding any irregularities in the functioning of the TPDS, they are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government for inquiry and appropriate action at their end. ...........2/--2-During the current calendar year 2021, so far 250 complaints have been received in the Department and have been forwarded to concerned States/UTs for necessary action and disposal at their end. An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders. (c) & (d): 	Allocation of foodgrains to States/UTs under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is made on the basis of identification of beneficiaries reported by the States/Union Territories (UTs) within the State/UT-wise coverage of population determined by erstwhile Planning Commission, and foodgrains entitlement prescribed under the Act i.e. 35 Kg per household per month for households covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and 5 Kg per person per month for Priority households.  As and when requests are received from States/UTs for revision of foodgrains allocation under the Act, within their NFSA coverage limit, the same are processed and revised allocation orders are issued as per the extant policy.*****
