ANSWER




                                                        (a)	& (b) No, Sir. Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP) was a component of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) which ended on 31.03.2012. However, in order to complete the on-going projects sanctioned upto 31.03.2012, the period of JnNURM was extended upto 31.03.2017. In the State of Telangana, 516 projects for construction of 11,288 houses involving central assistance of Rs. 227.85 crore were sanctioned under IHSDP during the Mission period. These include 14 infrastructure projects of Ranga Reddy district. There was no housing component in the IHSDP projects in Ranga Reddy district. A total of 9,495 houses have been constructed under IHSDP in the State. No new projects were sanctioned under IHSDP during the last three years.(c)	Solid Waste Management (SWM) is one of the components of Swachh  Bharat  Mission  (Urban)  [SBM-U]  since  its  inception  on 2 October  2014. Funds of Rs. 7,365.82 crore have been allocated for SWM component for the entire Mission period and works for SWM are taken up as Viability Gap Funding (VGF) from this budget.(d) The question does not arise in view of the fact that the extended period of IHSDP has ended on 31.03.2017.                                           *****
