                                                        a)  and (b): With the rapid growth of the internet coupled with the anonymity, there is a rise in cyber crime across the world. This increase in cyber crime also includes cyber bullying and cyber harassment. As per data maintained by the National Crimes Record Bureau (NCRB), a total of 7, 40 and 45 cases of cyber bullying/cyber stalking against children and women were registered during the year 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Latest data pertains to the year 2019.(c) and (d):  Government is committed for safety and trusted internet for users in India and has taken several steps that, inter alia, include:(i)     MeitY has enacted the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 which empower the users of Intermediaries and makes the social media platforms accountable for their safety.  The Rules require the intermediaries to adopt a robust grievance redressal mechanism including time-bound disposal of grievances. The Intermediaries need to convey their terms and conditions which must include communication to users  not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is harmful, defamatory, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy, harm minors in any way or are otherwise unlawful.  Intermediaries are also expected to remove any information violative of any law in India as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by an appropriate government or its authorised agency. The Rules also empower an individual to seek expeditious removal of such content which is prima facie in the nature of any material which exposes the private area of such individual, shows such individual in full or partial nudity or shows or depicts such individual in any sexual act or conduct, or is in the nature of impersonation in an electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual.  (ii)     Sections 354A and 354D of Indian Penal Code provide punishment for cyber bullying and cyber stalking. Further, the Information Technology Act, 2000 also provides for punishment for obscenity, sexually explicit information and child sexual abuse material.(iii)    Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) operates a National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, www.cybercrime.gov.in to enable citizens to report complaints pertaining to all types of cyber crimes with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. Complaints reported on this portal are attended by the respective Law Enforcement Authorities of States/Union Territories. Further any unlawful content can be reported to police station.(iv)  To spread awareness on cybercrime, MHA has taken several steps that include dissemination of messages on cybercrime through Twitter handle @cyberDost, radio campaign, publishing of Handbook for Adolescents / Students.(v)   MeitY through a program, namely, Information Security Education & Awareness (ISEA), has been creating awareness among users including women and children highlighting the importance of digital safety while using Internet. A dedicated website for information security awareness (https://www.infosecawareness.in) provides relevant awareness material. ********
