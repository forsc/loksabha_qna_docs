                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS AND ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):	The Government did not seek any formal certification or review from WHO for any traditional medication to treat COVID-19;(b) to (d):	Manufacturer of Coronil (M/s Patanjali Research Foundation Trust) have applied to the Interdisciplinary Technical Review Committee (ITRC) constituted by Ministry of AYUSH to review all the COVID-19 related claims through the State Licensing Authorities. The committee appraised & observed that the core ingredients of Coronil like Tulsi, Ashwagandha are included in the National Clinical Protocol for COVID-19 and also based on the rational and inference of Patanjali’s presentation, it was suggested that it may be used as supporting measure in COVID-19. The State Licensing Authority is also informed that Coronil tablet may be used as supporting measure in the management of COVID-19 without claiming cure.As per the WHO certification scheme, which is a scheme of Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (COPP) by National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for the purpose of international commerce i.e. for registration of products in foreign countries, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has issued Certification of Pharmaceutical Product (COPP) to M/s Divya Pharmacy Unit (II), Haridwar for their product Divya Coronil Tablet, after examination of their application in consultation with Ministry of AYUSH. (e) & (f):	 So far Government did not receive any data on the traditional medicine to cure COVID-19. However, Ministry of AYUSH has constituted a Interdisciplinary AYUSH R&D Task Force on COVID and also a core group of experts under the Chairmanship of Prof. Bhushan Patwardhan to identify and propose formulations on COVID-I9 which organized / reviewed the scientific studies on COVID-19 in line with principles of AYUSH systems and have obtained substantial leads on COVID-I9viz, one for prophylaxis as immune modulatory, another for management of COVID-19 with antiviral properties and one product for post COVlD-I9 care. Further an ITRC (Interdisciplinary Technical Review Committee) Chaired by Prof. Maulik from AIIMS, New Delhi is reviewing the studies on traditional medications intended to be used in COVID-19.
