ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) & (b):   The latest report of Health Index (referred to as Health Index-2020) report focuses on measuring and highlighting the overall performance and incremental improvement over the period 2019-20 in the States and UTs.As per the inputs received from  NITI Ayog, NITI Aayog in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the World Bank   have released   “Healthy States, Progressive India - Report on the Ranks of States and Union Territories”. The Health Index is a useful tool to measure and compare the Overall Performance and Incremental Performance across states/UTs over time, and is an important instrument in understanding the variations in performance across various parameters including health outcomes, governance and data integrity, and key inputs and processes. It measures the annual performance of states/UTs, and ranks states/UTs on the basis of incremental change, or the delta that captures annual progress, within the overarching context of the overall performance of the states/UTs.The state of Uttar Pradesh has shown a marked improvement in the performance in majority of the indicators. Among the Larger States, Uttar Pradesh is ranked at the top in terms of Incremental Performance by registering the highest incremental change of 5.5 points from the Base Year (2018-19) to Reference Year (2019-20).From the Base Year (2018-19) to the Reference Year (2019-20), Uttar Pradesh led in improving the performance of 33 out of 43 indicators/sub-indicators. Improvement in performance has been observed with respect to the intermediate health outcome indicators such as full immunization coverage, first trimester ANC registration, pregnant women receiving 4 or more ANCs, total case notification of TB and TB treatment success rate. This was achieved through intensive monitoring and review of the program performance at state and district level, identification of the beneficiaries through line listing, sharing due lists of beneficiaries with the field workers and by ensuring regular follow up of services. Creating awareness about TB, involvement of private practitioners, the use of IT and incentives to TB patients helped in improving TB notification and treatment success rate.Similarly, the State of Bihar has improved its standing in terms of incremental performance. From the base year to the reference year, the state of Bihar has shown a positive incremental performance of 1.89 points in 27 out of 43 indicators.(c) & (d):   Funds under NHM are allocated to the states/UTs based on the proposals submitted by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIP) subject  to norms and availability of resources. Besides that, funds have been allocated to the states of UP & Bihar for strengthening their health infrastructures under Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package-(ECRP-II), XV- Finance Commission- Health Grants through local governments and Pradhan Mantri- Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM).
