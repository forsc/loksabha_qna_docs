As per the guidelines, the administrative Ministries/ Departments shall monitor the performance of CPSEs functioning under them and classify them into sick, incipient sick and weak CPSEs. The guidelines provide that a CPSE would be considered sick if it meets one of the following criteria:(i) If it is declared sick as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.(ii) If its net worth is negative.   As per information available in the Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18 that was laid on the Table of both the Houses of Parliament on 27.12.2018, the CPSEs having negative networth as on 31.3.2018 along with the number of employees in such CPSEs are given in Annex-I.Further, as the CPSEs function under the administrative control of concerned Ministries/ Departments, all matters relating to revival/ restructuring/disinvestment including closure of sick CPSEs and revival/ rejuvenation of closed CPSEs/ units of CPSEs are dealt by the concerned administrative Ministry/ Department on a case-to-case basis.(c): 	As per the information available with DPE, Government has approved revival/ restructuring/merger plans for 6 sick/ loss making CPSEs, namely, (i) Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corpn. Ltd., (ii) Hindustan Steelwork Construction Ltd., (iii) Richardson &Cruddas Ltd. (iv) NEPA Ltd., (v) Hooghly Printing Company Ltd. and (vi) Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd.  Detail of such CPSEs is given in Annex-II. Further, Department of Fertilizers has informed that Government of India is reviving 5 closed fertilizer plants of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL) and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFCL) namely Talcher, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Sindri plants of FCIL and Barauni plant of HFCL by setting up new Ammonia Urea plants of 12.7 lakh metric tonnes per annum capacity. The detail in this regard is also given in Annex-II.(d): The employees of CPSEs which are being closed are entitled to compensation as per VRS/VSS guidelines of DPE. The revised guidelines for time bound closure of sick /loss making CPSEs issued by DPE on 14.6.2018, inter alia, provide for payment of VRS/VSS at 2007 notional pay scale to employees of CPSEs under closure irrespective of the existing pay scales of the company.Further, Government is implementing Counseling, Retraining & Redeployment (CRR) Scheme to provide opportunities of self/ wage employment to the employees (or their dependents) of CPSEs separated under Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)/ Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) due to closure / restructuring of CPSEs. The scheme aims to provide short duration skill development training programmes to equip the beneficiaries for self/ wage employment.****
