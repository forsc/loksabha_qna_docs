This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government.  Further, the Act also stipulates that the State Contd..2/-::  2  ::Government may formulate and notify, from time to time, suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers, including schemes relating to  (a) provident fund, (b) employment injury benefit, (c) housing, (d) educational schemes for children, (e) skill upgradation of workers, (f) funeral assistance; and (g) old age homes.Life and disability cover is provided by the Central Government, through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme.             For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Ministry of Labour & Employment in 2019 has launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) Yojana which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. The unorganised workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is    Rs. 15000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS(Govt. funded)  can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. The total number of beneficiaries enrolled under PM-SYM, state-wise, details is indicated at Annexure.Presently, 2.51 crore unorganized workers are enrolled and covered under various Social Security Schemes in the State of Andhra Pradesh.*                                                    *******
