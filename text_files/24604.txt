ANSWER




                                                        Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.; STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 43 REGARDING "BUDGET AIR SERVICE" TO BE ANSWERED ON 22.07.2021. ; (a) & (b): Presently, the air traffic in India is considerably reduced due to the Covid 19 pandemic. There is no air delay at any Indian airports due to air traffic congestion.  However, during the pre-Covid period, due to air traffic congestion, certain flights got delayed in air at certain periods of time at Delhi ( IGI Airport) , Mumbai ( CSI Airport) and Bengaluru ( KIA airport). Many aircraft used to arrive at the same time over an airport and therefore needed to be delayed in air (hovering over the airport) before landing.  The delay for an arriving aircraft during periods of congestion due to hovering was around 25 minutes. ;  (c) & (d): The Government of India has not been contemplating launch of ''Budget Air Service''. After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently as a result, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the relevant guidelines in this matter. However, the Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to promote air connectivity.
