ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b): Presently, Indian Railways have taken up 498 Railway projects of length 49,069 km, costing `6.75 lakh crore, which are in different stages of execution/planning/sanction, out of which, commissioning of 8,979 km has been achieved and expenditure of `1.53 lakh crore incurred up to March, 2019. Railway projects are sanctioned, based on demands raised by State Governments, Central Ministries, Members of Parliament, other public representatives and Railways’ own requirement, participation by State Government or private entities etc. They are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes.The average annual expenditure in Railway expansion projects (new line/gauge conversion/doubling projects) in 2014-19 was `26,022 crore which is 226% of average annual expenditure incurred during 2009-2014 and the allocation of Budget for 2019-20 is `30,198 crore, which is 262% of the average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.For capacity enhancement projects institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for throughput enhancement projects.(c) and (d): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site. Hence, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of projects.*****
