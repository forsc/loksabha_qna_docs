All these schemes are being implemented in the State of Maharashtra.  Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, DDU-GKY and RSETIs are demand driven programmes and hence no State-wise allocations are made under these schemes.  NSAP is a social security/social welfare programme and funds are released to the States based on the identification of beneficiaries by the States. The allocation of funds to the states for implementation of PMGSY depends, inter-alia, on works in hand, execution capacity of the State and unspent balance of previous year(s) available with the State. Moreover, the Central funds under PMGSY are released  to the State Government only and further funds are allocated at district level by the State Government itself.  The details of funds released/allocated to Maharashtra during the last five years under these schemes are at Annexure-I. (b):	The details of expenditure/allocation/utilization of funds under these schemes in the districts of Maharashtra including Osmanabad is at Annexure-II *****
