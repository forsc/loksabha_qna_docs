ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)          Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) is an outcome based Centrally Sponsored Scheme aimed at implementing the mandate of the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM). SANKALP aims to address ongoing challenges such as bringing about convergence, infusing quality in skill development programs and making them market relevant and accessible in the context of short-term training. SANKALP has three key result areas namely (i) Institutional Strengthening at Central, State and District level; (ii) Quality Assurance of skill development programmes; and (iii) Inclusion of marginalized population in skill development programmes. Unlike other skill development schemes, SANKALP is not a training scheme, it focuses upon interventions inline with the Result Areas as stated above. (d) and (e)      During the last three years, an amount of Rs 275.02 crore has been sanctioned to 30 States/ UTs, including Gujarat, Bihar and West Bengal, under the SANKALP Scheme. Out of these, Rs 263.32 crore have been released to 28 States/ UTs as State Incentive Grants while Rs 11.70 crore have been released to strengthen the skill ecosystem of 117 Aspirational Districts of 28 States. The details of the funds sanctioned to State/ UT wise are at Annexure-1.
