World Health Organization (WHO), on 26th May 2017, has reported 3 cases of Zika Virus disease from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, based on the report by Government of India to them. As on date, the state-wise laboratory confirmed cases of Zika Virus diseases reported since 2016 are as under:States/UTs	2016	2017	2018Gujarat	1	2	1Tamil Nadu	0	1	0Madhya Pradesh	0	0	130Rajasthan	0	0	159Total	1	3	290(c) & (d) Government of India initiated Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) in all States/UTs with the objective to detect and respond to disease outbreaks due to epidemic-prone diseases including Zika and other virus diseases. Weekly data on morbidity for epidemic-prone diseases is collected and analyzed to detect early rising phase of disease outbreaks, which is reported and responded to by trained districts/state level Rapid Response Teams (RRTs).There is no treatment available for Zika virus infection or its associated diseases. The patients are provided symptomatic treatment which is provided in public health facilities. Pregnant women living in areas with Zika transmission or who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection are monitored specifically in view of association of Zika virus disease with microcephaly. Encephalitis including Japanese Encephalitis (JE) cases are monitored through regular surveillance system by National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. There are various causes for encephalitis but primarily in India major cases relates to JE. Government of India  has  approved  multipronged  strategy  for prevention and control of Japanese Encephalitis for the 60 high burden districts of 5 states under which following provision have been made:•	JE vaccination campaign in children (1-15 years) followed by introduction of routine immunization in children of new cohorts with 2 doses of vaccine, one at 9 months age and second at the age of 16-24 months of age.•	Adult JE vaccination in identified districts.•	Strengthening of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation (PMR) Departments in identified Medical Colleges of 5 states.•	Establishment of sentinel sites where JE diagnostic kits are available free of cost.•	Strengthening of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) / Behavioral Change Communication (BCC) activities.Similarly, for other vector borne diseases, Government of India supports states in terms of surveillance and testing and guide with respect to standard case management guidelines to be followed in case of viral infections.
