ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Water is a state subject and water resources projects are planned, executed and maintained by respective State Governments from their own resources and as per their requirements and priorities. The role of the Central Government is limited to supplement the efforts of the State Governments by providing technical guidance and central assistance through its various schemes, if specifically sought by the State Government. In the ongoing Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), there is a need based provision for partner agencies to restore the lost capacity of few selected dams. Under DRIP, Central Water Commission (CWC) has published “Handbook for Assessing and Managing Reservoir Sedimentation” and recommends dam owners to follow this handbook. Further, Guidelines for preparation of operation and Maintenance Manual for Dams has also been published. Also 162 Nos. of Operation and Maintenance Manual have been prepared under ongoing DRIP, it includes correct method and sequence of opening and closing gates, including low level bottom outlets for flushing the sediment out from reservoirs.Need based provision for restoration of lost capacity of reservoirs have been kept in the proposed DRIP Phases II & III also. Implementation agencies may utilize this opportunity for restoration of reservoir capacities of the selected dams. (c) & (d) CWC carries out Reservoir Sedimentation Studies using Hydro graphic Survey and Remote Sensing Technique. CWC also collects, collates and compiles the sedimentation data from the project authorities/State Government. The collected data are collated, analyzed and compiled as “Compendium on Siltation of reservoirs in India”. Earlier 3 editions of the compendium have been published in years 1991, 2001 and 2015. The 4th edition (the recent one) has been published in 2020 incorporating information of 369 reservoirs. In the Compendium the trends/rates of siltation in various Dams of different regions of the country has been duly analyzed. The details of the compendium is available on CWC Website at http://cwc.gov.in/other-publications-cwc*****
