ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c): Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE)Act, 2009 provides for admission of children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantageousgroups in the neighbourhood schools in Class I to the extent of at least 25 percent of the strengthof that class. Section 12(2) further mandates that such schools shall be reimbursed expenditureincurred by them according to per-child cost norms notified by the concerned State/UTGovernment. For reimbursement, private unaided schools complying with Section 12(1)(c)submit their claim for reimbursement to respective State /UT Government through the districtoffice and the school is reimbursed expenditure so incurred by it to the extent of per-childexpenditureincurred by the State, or the actual amount charged; whichever is less, in suchmanner as may be prescribed. Thereafter, the State/UT Government brings the proposal to theCentral Government for reimbursement against the expenditure so incurred by them in theirAnnual Work Plan proposal. The fund approved for reimbursement to the States/UTs is a part ofthe overall allocation under the centrally sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha for a given yearwhich is shared between Centre and States/UTs as per the applicable sharing pattern.(d) to (e): The arrears of previous years (starting from 2014-15) can be claimed by the States andUTs from central government provided the amount has been reimbursed to private schools andthe proposal is in confirmation of the approved norms.(f): The reason for this capping of twenty percent is due to difference in per child cost notifiedby the different States & UTs. In case, the actual expenditure on children admitted under section12(1)(c) of the RTE Act is over and above the cap of 20%, the additional expenditure is to beborne by the concerned State/ UT.****
