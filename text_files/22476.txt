                                                             MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3465 BY SHRIMATI GOMATI SAI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2021 REGARDING ONGOING/PENDING RAIL PROJECTS IN CHHATTISGARH(a) Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railways and not State wise as Indian Railway’s network span across various State boundaries. However, presently, 18 Projects of total length 2900 km costing ?42,083 crore falling fully/partly in the State of Chhattisgarh are under different stage of planning/approval/execution, out of which 527 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?9344 crore has been incurred upto March 2020. Chhattisgarh is covered by South East Central Railway and East Coast Railway Zone of Indian Railways. Details of projects including expenditure and Budget outlay project-wise on each project are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in>Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Regular Budget/Pink Book(year) Railway wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme.During 2014-19, 416 Km sections (42 km of New line and 374 km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in Chhattisgarh have been commissioned  ( average rate 83 km per year), which is 1200% more with respect to commissioning during 2009-14 (32 km).  During 2019-20, 103 Km sections (43 km of New line and 60 km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in Chhattisgarh have been commissioned in the state which is 1617% more w.r.t. to average commissioning during 2009-14 ( 6 km per year).  During 2014-19 Average annual Budget allocation on Infrastructure projects & safety works falling fully/partly in Chhattisgarh State has been enhanced to ?2,274 crore per year  from ?311 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 631% more as compared to average allocation during 2009-14. Total allocation of Budget for these projects in 2019-20 has been increased to ?3269 crore, which is 951% more than the average of 2009-14. Allocation for these works, in 2020-21 has been increased to  ?3845 crore which is the highest ever budget and 1136% more with respect to average of 2009-14.(b) & (c) The timely completion of Railway project/s depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project/s. As such, no confirmed time frame for completion of project/s can be ascertained at this stage. However, Railway is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects.(d) Various steps taken by the Indian Railway for expeditious implementation of Rail projects include (i) prioritisation of projects  (ii) substantial increase in allocation of funds on priority projects (iii) delegation of powers at field level (iv) close monitoring of progress of project at various levels and (v) regular follow up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and Wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects. (e) The work of Raipur-Sarangarh-Jharsuguda new line was included in Budget 2013-14 subject to requisite approvals. State Govt. of Chhattisgarh and Odisha were approached for providing land free of cost and to share 50% cost of work. As no response has been received from both State Governments, the project could not be taken forward. However, on suggested alignment, project of Durg-New Raipur-Kharsia new line has been identified by Chhattisgarh Rail Corporation Ltd.(CRCL) State Joint Venture  of Government of Chhattisgarh for feasibility study.*****
