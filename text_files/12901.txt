MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 155 FOR REPLY ON 02.03.2020 ASKED BY SHRI BALUBHAU ALIAS SURESH NARAYAN DHANORKAR REGARDING NATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY(a) to (e): The Government is in the process of formulating a New Education Policy for meeting the changing dynamics of the population’s requirement with regard to quality education, innovation and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge. For this purpose, it carried out a highly participative, inclusive and multi-pronged consultation process, through online, grassroots and thematic expert consultations. A Committee for the Draft National Education Policy was constituted in June 2017 under the Chairmanship of eminent scientist Dr. K Kasturirangan, which has submitted the Draft National Education Policy 2019(DNEP 2019) to the Ministry on 31st May 2019. The Draft NEP 2019 has been uploaded on MHRD’s website at https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf and also at https://innovate.mygov.in/list-nep/ to elicit comments and suggestions from the various stakeholders. Further, letters were written to States/UTs Governments and Government of India Ministries inviting their views and comments on DNEP 2019.  An Education Dialogue with Hon’ble MPs of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Karnataka & Odisha on three consecutive days i.e on 31.07.2019, 01.08.2019 & 02.08.2019. Two meetings with State Education Secretaries of School Education and another with State Secretaries of Higher & Technical Education was held on 09.07.2019 and 08.08.2019 respectively. Around 2 lakh suggestions on the Draft National Education Policy received from various stakeholders. A special meeting of CABE on National Education Policy was held on 21.09.2019, to discuss the National Education Policy. There has been wide publicity and positive feedback from all stakeholders. Accordingly, based on all feedback/comments received from various stakeholders on the Draft NEP, the Ministry is in the process of finalizing the National Education Policy, 2020.Since Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution of India, hence, State/UT Government will play a vital role in the implementation of the National Education Policy. The goals of the policy will be implemented in a coordinated and phased manner in collaboration with the State Governments.*******
