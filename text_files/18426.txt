                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Rural Health Statistics (RHS) is an annual publication, based on Health care administrative data generated by the health care system. RHS provides information on rural health infrastructure and requirements of public health facilities in rural areas as reported by States. As per the RHS 2019, the state-wise details of shortfall of health facilities are at Annexure.(b):	“Public Health and Hospitals” being a State subject, the issues related to posting of Human Resource is being dealt by respective States. Hence, policy action with regard to mandatory service for doctors passing out, in backward & rural areas, lies with the State Governments.(c):	“Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject the primary responsibility for ensuring healthcare services to all the citizens of the country especially poor lies with respective State Government. However, to address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM). NHM support is provided to States/ UTs for setting up of new facilities as per norms and upgradation of existing facilities for bridging the infrastructure gaps and to fill up the vacancies of Human Resource on contractual basis based on the requirement posed by them. Further, by December, 2022 under Ayushman Bharat – Health & Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs), 1.5 lakh Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres are to be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) across the country for provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach.
