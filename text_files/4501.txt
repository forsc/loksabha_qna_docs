ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b) Sir, maintenance & repair of national highways is an ongoing process.  On completed sections, repair & maintenance is carried out by O&M contractors/BOT concessionaires. In stretches under implementation, the maintenance is carried out by the contractor/concessionaire as part of their obligations in the contract.  Stretches entrusted to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) but where work is yet to start are maintained either directly by NHAI or through State Public Works Department (PWD). 	For the stretch which is already awarded to the concessionaire on BOT basis, it is obligatory on the part of concessionaire to maintain the stretch in traffic worthy condition.  Where concessionaire fails to repair roads as per the concession agreement, NHAI undertakes repairing work at risk and cost of the concessionaire. The companies are engaged on the basis of competitive bidding process.(c) & (d) Works on NH executed through NHAI are monitored by engaging consultants. Besides, field units of NHAI and officers from Headquarters/Ministry also monitor. Supervision consultants/Independent Engineers are deployed to properly monitor the maintenance of NHs.*****
