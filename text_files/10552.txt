ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)Irrigation is a State subject and hence, initiatives pertaining to irrigation policies, schemes and collaboration emanates primarily from the States. To supplement their efforts and to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources, the Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments through various schemes and programmes.The National Water Policy, 2012 stressed the importance of water saving in irrigation by adopting methods such as aligning cropping pattern with natural resource endowments, micro irrigation, automated irrigation operation, evaporation-transpiration reduction. The Policy also underscored the need to encourage recycling of canal seepage water through conjunctive ground water use and the use of very small local level irrigation through small bunds, field ponds for watershed development.Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) launched in 2015-16 by the Government is a major irrigation programme which include Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI), and Ground Water Irrigation schemes of the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR). Other components include Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Watershed Development of the Ministry of Rural Development.Under AIBP, 99 major and medium irrigation projects having combined ultimate irrigation potential of 75.43 lakh Hectares are under implementation; and under CADWM, development of the command area of these 99 projects have been taken up, targeting 44.35 lakh hectares of Culturable Command Area (CCA). These 99 prioritized projects are funded through creation of ‘Long Term Irrigation Fund’ under NABARD for mission mode completion of projects. Irrigation deprived areas having adequate replenishable ground water resources are covered under the Ground Water Irrigation scheme. The beneficiaries under this scheme are small and marginal farmers only, with priority to be given to SC/ST and women farmers.The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare implements Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro irrigation by providing financial assistance the States. The scheme also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement micro irrigation.*****
