ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):  Domestic production of edible oils is unable to meet domestic demand. The domestic consumption/demand of edible oils is around 250 LMT while the domestic production is only 111.6 LMT. The gap between demand and supply of edible oils is around 56% and is met through imports. The increase in the international prices of edible oils have an impact on domestic prices of edible oils in the country. The production of domestic oilseeds has been stagnant since 2010-11. However, domestic demand for edible oils has been increasing at a pace faster than that of production due to growth in population and improvement in the living standards of people. Hence domestic production is insufficient to meet the demand.  Increase in the international prices of edible oils during 2020-21 has led to increase in cost of imports of edible oils and consequently their prices.(b): 	Import of edible oils is under Open General Licence (OGL) and anybody can import after following the procedure. However, there is no proposal to import edible oils in the country by the Government. (c): 	Does not arise. ****
