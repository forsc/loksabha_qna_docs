                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (d): 	The normal area (average of 2013-14 to 2017-18) under sugarcane cultivation in the country is 48.32 lakh hectares. During 2015-16, area under sugarcane was estimated above the normal area coverage. The area under sugarcane declined to 44.36 lakh hectares during 2016-17 due to lesser area coverage in Maharashtra and then increased to 47.37 lakh hectares during 2017-18. The area coverage under sugarcane further increased to 51.31 lakh hectares during 2018-19 (as per 3rd Advance Estimate). The normal yield (average of 2013-14 to 2017-18) of sugarcane in the country is 72388 kg per hectare. During 2015-16 and 2016-17, yield of sugarcane was estimated below the normal yield. However, it increased to 80198 kg per hectare during 2017-18 and is estimated at 78033 kg per hectare during 2018-19 (as per 3rd Advance Estimate) which are significantly higher than the normal yield.Contd….2/--2-State-wise details of area sown under sugarcane crop and yield of sugarcane during each of the last three years and current year i.e. from 2015-16 to 2018-19 (as per 3rd Advance Estimate) are given at Annexure-I and II.The area under sugarcane cultivation depends on farmers’ preference, shift of area to other competing crops, agro- climatic conditions, inter-crop relative profitability, irrigation facilities, resources available and timely payment of cane dues to farmers by the sugar mills.(e): 	To enhance production and productivity of sugarcane in the country, the Government has been implementing Sugarcane Development Programme under National Food Security Mission - Commercial Crops (NFSM-CC) in 13 major sugarcane growing states of the country viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh from 2014-15. Under this scheme thrust has been given on transfer of technology through frontline demonstrations and training in order to extend benefits to the farmers. The components under NFSM-CC Sugarcane include demonstration on inter-cropping and single bud chip technology with sugarcane, assistance for breeder seed production, production / supply of tissue culture plantlets/seedlings, distribution of plant protection chemicals and bio-agents, etc.The Central Government also fixes Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane, well in advance of sowing season, to induce farmers to sow sugarcane. FRP is a minimum benchmark price below which sugar mills cannot purchase cane from the cane growers.The states can also support Sugarcane Development Programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLCC).
