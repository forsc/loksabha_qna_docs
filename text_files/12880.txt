MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) : The erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme wasunder implementation since 2000-2001 for universalization of elementary education throughout thecountry. Now, SSA along-with other two centrally sponsored schemes of Rashtriya Madhyamik ShikshaAbhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) have been subsumed under a new Integrated Scheme forSchool Education-Samagra Shiksha, launched in the country from 2018-2019. It is an overarchingprogramme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensureinclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education.The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of SSA/Samagra Shiksha has an inbuilt concurrent evaluationand monitoring system. The Ministry of Human Resource Development convenes periodic meetings withState Education Ministers and Secretaries to review the programmes. Educational data is collectedthrough a Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+) every year to assess theprogress. A National Achievement Survey (NAS) across all States and UTs was conducted on13.11.2017 to assess the learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5 and 8. The status of theseevaluations and monitoring is placed in the public domain. Further, an All India Performance Audit onImplementation of RTE Act. 2009 was conducted by the Comptroller & Auditor General of India(C&AG) for the period extending from 2010-11 to 2015-16 and accordingly Report No. 23 of 2017 hasbeen laid on the Table of the Parliament on 21.07.2017. An independent third party evaluation of theSSA Scheme was also conducted in 2017-18.
