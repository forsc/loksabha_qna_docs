The matter is under examination.(c) to (e) : Section 20 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 defines the meaning of the expression “ordinarily resident.” It also lays down the specific place which is deemed to be the ordinary residence of the persons specified therein. However, with a view to making the existing provisions gender neutral, a proposal to substitute the word ‘wife’ with the word ‘spouse’ appearing in sub-section (6) of the section 20 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 as well as sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of section 60 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 is under consideration of the Government.
