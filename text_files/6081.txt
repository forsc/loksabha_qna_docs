                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	The National Malaria Eradication Programme was launched in the year 1958 with the objective of eradicating malaria from the country. The programme achieved success to the extent that zero death due to malaria was recorded in 1965. However, after that malaria resurgence took place and the number of malaria cases and deaths increased in the country as well as globally.(c):	Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), the nodal agency under Government of India (GoI), looking after the vector borne diseases including malaria, has achieved spectacular success in bringing down cases as well as deaths due to malaria. The success of India’s Malaria Programme was lauded by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the World Malaria Report, 2018 which indicated that India was the only High Burden country which reported decline of nearly 24% in malaria cases in  2017 as compared to 2016. In the recent years, malaria cases and deaths have come down drastically as given below:Years	Cases	Deaths2016	1087285	3312017	844558	1942018	429928	96(d):	As per the National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME) India, 2016-30, launched in February, 2016 to eliminate malaria in a phased manner by 2027, all the States/Union Territories(UTs) of the country are divided into three Categories: i.	15 low burden States (Category 1) are targeted for elimination by 2020.ii.	11 moderate burden States (Category 2) by 2022.iii.	The 10 high burden States (Category 3) by 2027. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana fall in Category 2.(e):	Public Health and hospitals is a State subject. All the States have been advised to fill up vacant sanctioned posts in the sub-centers. Additional contractual human resource support has also been provided to high Malaria endemic states. Malaria is going down in the country because of increased use of rapid diagnostic kits for quick diagnosis and treatment of malaria and use of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) in high malarious areas.(f):	 The budget earmarked for the NVBDCP including Malaria in 2019-20 is Rs.1202.81 crore.
