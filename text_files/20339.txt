                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Works related to enumeration of water bodies, their protection from encroachment, or diversion for use for other purposes, comes under the purview of State Government concerned. However, from time to time, this Ministry conducts census of minor irrigation schemes in the country, which captures data regarding water bodies in rural areas associated with irrigation. As per the 5th Minor Irrigation Census conducted by this Ministry with reference year 2013-14, there are 5,16,303 water bodies in the rural areas of the country which are being used for minor irrigation, out of which 53,396 are not in use for various reasons such as non-availability of water, siltation, salinity etc.(b)  State-wise details of water bodies in the rural areas being used for minor irrigation, including Maharashtra, are placed at Annexure.(c) Works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves, as per their own resources and priorities. The role of Government of India is limited to technical support and financial assistance under the existing schemes, as per the guidelines. For water bodies, a scheme titled Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies is being implemented by this Ministry, under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) – Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP).From XIIth Plan onwards, 2,219 water bodies costing Rs.1910 crore have been included under this scheme from various States, and central assistance of Rs.469.68 crore has been released. Out of these 2,219 water bodies, works in 1,465 water bodies have been reported to be completed.Further, from time to time this Ministry has been sensitising the State Governments regarding the importance of water bodies for socio economic development and sustainable water security to the local population. Need for taking necessary steps for keeping all the water bodies encroachment free, such as inclusion of water bodies in land records and making them integral part of town planning process, strict action for the encroachers, etc. is also being emphasised to the State Governments by this Ministry, from time to time. ***** 				ANNEXURE Annexure referred to in reply to part (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1614 for reply on 11.2.2021 regarding  “Encroachment of Water Bodies”.
