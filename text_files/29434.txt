ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (c) :	The country was able to meet the surge in peak demand which went upto a record 200.5 (GW) during April-October, 2021 against the peak demand of 176.4 GW during the corresponding period 	of last year, an increase of about 14%. During April-October, 2021, about 817.8 Billion Units (BUs) energy was supplied against the requirement of about 821.7 BU, a shortfall of only 0.47% which was due to constraints in distribution network and financial constraints of discoms.The coal despatched to power sector by Coal India Limited (CIL) during April-October, 2021 was about 292 MT as against about 238 MT during the corresponding period of last year, an increase of 22.7%. The reduction in import of coal did not affect the generation as the requirement was met from domestic sources. During April-October, 2021, the coal based generation in the country increased by about 16% as compared to the corresponding period of last year.(d): 	The details of plant-wise generation during April-October, 2021 are given at Annexure.(e) & (f): 	As per the present Import Policy, coal and gas are under Open General License and can be freely imported by the power utilities themselves considering their need based on their commercial prudence. Further, the Government has issued the revised coal stocking norms which mandates the power plants to maintain sufficient stock at all times to meet any contingent situation. **************
