Agriculture related exemptions were allowed in the guidelines. This ensured smooth functioning of agricultural operations. Timely interventions and exemptions resulted in good results. The Standard Operations Procedures (SOPs) were communicated to farmers for their safety and keeping social distancing while undertaking farm related activities. As a result of the proactive steps taken, both harvesting activities of the Rabi crop, and sowing activities of summer crops were undertaken in a systematic manner. National Conference on Agriculture for Kharif Campaign-2020 was organized through Video Conference on 16.04.2020 to discuss with the States on challenges & strategies for crop management during Kharif cultivation. There has been satisfactory progress of sowing area coverage under Kharif crops. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme during the period of COVID 19 pandemic, about 10.46 crore farmer families have been benefitted and an amount of Rs. 20926.64 crore was released. Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana, the small and marginal farmer of age group of 18 to 40 years with the contribution of Rs. 55/- to Rs. 200/-per month get the amount of Rs. 3000 per month after attaining the age of 60 years. So far more than 20.00 lakhs beneficiaries have been registered under this scheme.The Government had provided the facility of Kisan Credit Card to the farmers to invest in crops and animal husbandry and fisheries. Now the beneficiary farmers of PM-KISAN Scheme are also getting the facilities of Kisan Credit Card. There is no mortgage required to avail loan up to Rs1.60 lakh.Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), total claims of  Rs 5,326.7 crores were paid during lockdown period.  PMFBY was made more efficient and farmer friendly and made voluntary for all farmers. Government of India will now bear 90% of premium subsidy liability for North Eastern States instead of 50% earlier. Further benefit of 2% Interest Subvention (IS) to Banks and 3% Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) to all farmers for all crop loans up to Rs. 3 lakh given by banks was extended till 31/8/2020.******
