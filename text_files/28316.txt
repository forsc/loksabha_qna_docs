However, the emission intensity of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reduced by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016. (b) The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) with the objective of adaptation and mitigation and comprising of missions in specific areas including solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. To support the NAPCC thirty-three States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change taking into account their specific concerns relating to climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) with target to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India at Conference of Parties (COP26) at Glasgow presented five nectar elements, Panchamrit, to deal with the challenges of climate change - (i) India will reach its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030 (ii) India will meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 (iii) India will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030 (iv) by 2030, India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45 percent and (v) by the year 2070, India will achieve the target of Net Zero. (c) & (d) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is implementing Environment Education, Awareness and Training (EEAT) scheme with the objective to promote environmental awareness among all sections of the society and to mobilize people’s participation for conservation of environment. The objectives of the scheme are achieved through implementation of the programmes namely National Green Corps (NGC) – “Ecoclub” Programme, National Nature Camping Programme (NNCP) and Capacity Building Activities (CBA) on EEAT scheme.Under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry, there are around 1,60,000 Eco-clubs across the country, wherein students are actively participating in various environment protection and conservation activities like conducting cleanliness drives as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, plantation, awareness on waste minimisation, segregation, recycling and reuse etc.Further, to engage people for environment protection, Ministry has also launched Green Good Deeds (GGDs) movement in January 2018 with the aim to bring mass environmental awareness in the society at all levels. The GGDs covers all the aspects of environment protection and conservation viz. biodiversity, wildlife, pollution, renewable energy, conservation of lakes and rivers, solid waste management and climate change. GGD is implemented under NGC “Ecoclub” programme. Any member of society can participate in the movement.***
