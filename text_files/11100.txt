ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b):		Complaints regarding cheating/ overcharging of tourists and other issues relating to service providers including travel agents are received in the Ministry on an ongoing basis either from the complainants or through the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring Systems (CPGRAMS) portal. On receipt of such complaints, the matter is taken up with the concerned service providers seeking clarification to facilitate resolution of the issues. In case instances of exploitation of tourists are brought to the notice of the Ministry of Tourism, the grievance is taken up with the concerned State Government/ Union Territory (UT) Administration since service providers are required to be registered/licensed under local rules/acts of the concerned State/UT. The complainant is also advised to approach the appropriate forum, such as consumer court, for redressal on case to case basis.(c):	Ministry of Tourism has launched the 24x7 Multi Lingual Tourist Info-Helpline on the toll free number 1800111363 or on a short code 1363 in 12 Languages including 10 international languages, Hindi & English to provide support service in terms of information relating to Travel in India and offer appropriate guidance to tourists in distress while travelling in India.(d):	To ensure standardized services for tourists, the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India gives approval to different categories of service providers in the Travel Industry including Tour Operators/Travel Agents/Tourist Transport Operators, etc. in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Ministry for each category. This is purely a voluntary scheme and it is not mandatory for the service providers to seek approval of the Ministry for conducting business. In case of complaints of serious nature against the approved service providers, the Ministry of Tourism may take action against them, which may include withdrawal of the approval/re-approval granted.*******
