                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e):  The data on employment/ unemployment is being collected through Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI) since 2017-18. The latest available report is for the year 2019-20. As per the results of PLFS conducted during 2018-19 and 2019-20, the year-wise/ State-wise estimated Worker Population Ratio (WPR) on usual status for 15 years and above is at Annexure.	Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is also publishing monthly payroll data relating to employment in the formal sector. This highlights that cumulative net payroll addition to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscriber base is 77.08 lakh for the year 2020-2021, which is almost at par with previous year (78.58 lakh). It is observed that there is addition in net payroll as represented by EPFO subscriber base in each month of 2020-21 except for the month of April and May 2020. 	Covid-19 pandemic has affected various sectors of the economy. The Government is providing fiscal stimulus of more than Rs.twenty seven lakh crore as part of the Aatmanirbhar financial Package, comprising of various long term schemes/programmes/ policies for making the country self-reliant and to create employment opportunities.	Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for promoting employment generation in the country. Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) has been launched w.e.f. 1st October, 2020 to incentivize employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of employment. The new employees under the scheme includes those who have lost their employment during Covid-19 pandemic and didn’t join in any EPF covered establishment upto 30.09.2020.The terminal date for registration of beneficiary under the scheme has been extended from 30th June, 2021 to 31st March, 2022.	Government had launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) of 125 days on 20th June, 2020 to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for returnee migrant workers and similarly affected persons including youth in rural areas, in 116 selected districts across 6 States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.	Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), Government of India has contributed both 12% employer’s share and 12% employee’s share under Employees Provident Fund (EPF), totaling 24% of the wage for the wage month from March to August, 2020 for the establishments having upto 100 employees with 90% of such employees earning less than Rs. 15000/-.This has helped in protecting employment in EPFO registered establishments during post Covid period.	The unemployment benefit under the Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana being implemented by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has been enhanced to 50% from 25% of the average earning, payable upto 90 days, alongwith relaxation of eligibility conditions to claim the benefit, for insured workers who have lost employment due to COVID-19.	PM-SVANidhi Scheme has facilitated collateral free working capital loan upto Rs.10,000/- for one-year tenure to street vendors, to help them resume their businesses during the post Covid period.  	Government has increased MGNREGA wage to Rs. 202 a day from Rs. 182 to benefit nearly 13.62 crore families.	In addition, RBI and Government of India have taken several monetary and liquidity measures to keep the flow of credit uninterrupted to the productive sectors of the economy including MSME sector. *****
