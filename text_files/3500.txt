Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a public Sector entity under the administrative control of Ministry of Power, will replace old inefficient electric motors with energy efficient IE3 motors which is likely to result in energy and cost saving to the tune of 10-15% in the first phase. In the second phase it will replace energy efficient powerlooms and rapier kits in bulk and provide them to small and medium powerloom units. The use of these efficient equipments would result in energy savings and cost savings to the unit owners at no upfront cost. Powerloom clusters at Ichalkaranji, Bhiwandi, Erode, Surat, Bhilwara and  Panipat have been identified for pilot study.****
