                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a),(b), (c), and (f)Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is considered as one of the contributors to the poor air quality in Delhi and NCR during early winter months. As per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, the estimated impact of stubble burning in PM 2.5 levels of Delhi ranged between 2% (07.11.2019) to 46% (31.10.2019).The levels of Air Quality Index in Delhi and major National Capital Region cities for October 2019 are attached asAnnexure A.In order to prevent stubble burning, a new Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ for the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 is being implemented by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare with the total outgo from the Central funds of Rs. 1151.80 crore (Rs. 591.65 crore in 2018-19 and Rs. 560.15 crore in 2019-20).	Under this Scheme, the agricultural machines and equipments for in-situ crop residue management such as Super Straw Management System (SMS) for Combine Harvesters, Happy Seeders, Hydraulically Reversible MB Plough, Paddy Straw Chopper, Mulcher, Rotary Slasher, Zero Till Seed Drill and Rotavators are provided with 50% subsidy to the individual farmers and 80% subsidy for establishment of Custom Hiring Centres(CHCs).  The State Governments during 2018-19 have supplied more than 56290 machines to the individual farmers and Custom Hiring Centres on subsidy for in-situ management of crop residue. During 2019-20, it has been targeted to supply more than 46578 machines.In compliance to the directions ofHon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 06.11.2019, the Government of Punjab has brought out a scheme for providing compensation @ Rs. 100/-per quintal to small and marginal farmers who are cultivating non-basmati paddy and are managing the paddy residue by in-situ method without burning. The Government of Haryana also brought out the scheme to provide Rs. 1000/-per acre operational charges for crop residue management for in-situ and ex-situ purposes. The Government of Haryana will also give Rs. 100 per quintal incentive to those farmers who have sold their paddy after 06.11.2019 and till 15.11.2019 and have not burnt the crop residue. The National Green Tribunal in the order passed on 10.12.2015, directed and prohibited agricultural residue burning in any part of the NCT of Delhi, State of Rajasthan, State of Punjab, State of Uttar Pradesh and State of Haryana. Any person or body that is found violating the directions of National Green Tribunal is liable to pay Environmental Compensation which is collected by the concerned State Governments. Further, extensive Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities for creating awareness among farmers have been undertaken by the States. States are also taking strong measures against those who have burnt stubble by way of lodging FIRs and charging penalties.With the efforts of the Government, overall, about 15% and 41% reduction in burning events wereobserved in 2018 as compared to that in 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2019-20 season, the total burning events recorded in the three States are 19.2% less than in 2018 till 18th November. UP has recorded 36.8% reduction, Haryana recorded 25.1% reduction, and Punjab recorded 16.8% reduction, respectively, in the current season than in 2018.(d) & (e) As per meeting held with Ministry of Power, State Governments of Punjab and Haryana to take effective steps to ensure that all coal-based thermal power plants, including those in private sector, use minimum of 5% of biomass pellets and up to 10% to be co-fired with coal.*****
