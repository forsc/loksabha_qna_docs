ANSWER




                                                        (a): Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology. It enables tamper evidence and immutability features to digital artifacts through reliable verification from the single source of truth. Blockchain Technology uses established cryptographic algorithms to enable the security, which promises the increased transparency and robust technology against many security threats. (b):  To disseminate information / educate the citizens, society and other stake holder/users, MeitY has launched INDIAai portal (https://indiaai.gov.in) on May 30, 2020. INDIAai is the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Portal of India - a central hub for everything on AI in India and beyond. It is the single central knowledge hub on artificial intelligence and allied fields for aspiring entrepreneurs, students, professionals, academics, and others.(c):    Government is aware of “Deepfake Technology” which enables to alter/ create the image or video of a person with any other person’s image or video using artificial neural networks and deep learning/machine learning techniques. These do represent security risk for individuals, enterprises and nations.The newly notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, mandates all intermediaries to take all reasonable and practicable measures to remove or disable access to such content which is in the nature of impersonation in an electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual, hosted, stored, published or transmitted by it. MeitY through a programme, namely, Information Security Education & Awareness (ISEA), has been creating awareness among users. A dedicated website for information security awareness (https://www.infosecawareness.in) provides relevant awareness material.Further for evolving technologies and their misuse like this, the Government continuously interacts with the stakeholders including identification of possible legislative changes.******
