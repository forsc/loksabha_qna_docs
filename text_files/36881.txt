In the Kasaragod district of Kerala, IP population is 9388 against the norm of 20,000 IP population within a radius of 25 kms. for setting up of a 30 bedded ESI hospital.  However, in such areas including Kasaragod (Kerala), where there is no ESI hospital, the ESI beneficiaries are provided primary, secondary and tertiary care medical services through tie-up arrangements with public and private hospitals.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::          	 In Kasaragod district (Kerala), tie-up arrangement has already been made with M/s. Aramana Hospital and Heart Centre for providing medical services to ESI beneficiaries.            	ESI Scheme, framed under the ESI Act 1948, is one of the oldest schemes in the country and all the workers are generally aware of the scheme.  However, the ESIC has taken various steps to reach out to the workers to make them aware of the facilities under the ESI Schemes, including the following:-i.	Media publicity through advertisements, press releases, social media, interactions on television, etc. for dissemination of information on new initiatives by the ESIC.ii.	Organising meetings, seminars, outreach programmes, health check-up camps/melas, awareness drives, etc.iii.	Collecting feedback from targeted audience for timely corrective action, clarifications etc. iv.
