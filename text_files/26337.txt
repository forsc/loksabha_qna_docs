Customs exemptions have been rationalized over the last few years and a large number of exemptions have been removed. Further, certain policy change, extensive application of RNS, institutional mechanism of audits in customs etc. have helped in garnering additional revenue. Central excise duty is contributed largely by Petrol and Diesel which has witnessed growth in revenues.        Government is taking all possible steps to increase GST collection which includes GST rate rationalization to improve tax compliance, e-invoice system, mandatory e-filing and e-payment of taxes, penalty for delayed payment, extensive use of third-party sources such as State VAT Department, Income Tax etc. for compliance verification, regular enforcement & compliance verification of tax returns, taxpayer education and media campaign etc.       Concerted efforts have been made to improve tax compliance. System based analytical tools and system generated red flag reports are being shared with Central as well as State Tax authorities to take action against tax evaders. E-way bill squads have been activated for the purposes of random verification of the goods in transit. Rule 138E of the CGST Rules, 2017 has been amended which provides that when a taxpayer fails to file his or her GST returns (GSTR-3B) for two continuous months, he or she will get blocked from generating an e-way bill. A new rule 36(4) has been inserted in CGST Rules, 2017 which puts a restriction that the ITC availed by a taxpayer shall not exceed 105 per cent of the eligible credit.***
