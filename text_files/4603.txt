ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (b) Under RCS(Regional Connectivity Scheme)- UDAN(Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme, there is a provision of revival of existing unserved airports. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal on 06 March, 2017 for revival of existing un-served / under-served airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions.;However, the construction of new airports is outside the purview of RCS-UDAN.;(c) Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN scheme on 21-10-2016 to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS - UDAN by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap, if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.
