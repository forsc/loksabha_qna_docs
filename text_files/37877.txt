Government provided all possible assistance in terms of shelter, food and medical attention where required, to displaced Indians who crossed over to the western neighbours of Ukraine, and they were eventually evacuated through flights operated under Operation Ganga. Welfare of Indians abroad, including students, is a top priority for the Government of India.As per information received from public sector banks and, in respect of 21 private sector banks, from the Indian Banks’ Association, as on 31st December 2021, 1,319 students had availed of education loan for study in Ukraine with outstanding balance of Rs.121.61 crore. The current situation is fluid and Government is closely monitoring developments. Implications of the ongoing conflict can be assessed and remedial steps considered only once the situation has stabilised.In the meantime, Government has decided to ask the Indian Banks’ Association to assess the impact of the conflict on outstanding education loans of the returnee students and to initiate stakeholder consultations in this regard. ***
