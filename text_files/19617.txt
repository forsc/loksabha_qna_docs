ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	As per the information available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) generation of e-waste is increasing every year.The Government has made provisions for inventorization of e-waste generation across the country under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. Under the said Rules, the responsibility for inventorization of generation of E-Waste has been assigned to State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs).		The E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016are effective from 01.10.2016. Accordingly, CPCB has estimated the generation of e-waste at the national level on the basis of sales data of 21 types of notified Electrical & Electronic Equipment (EEE) from Financial Year (FY) 2017-2018. The estimated generation of e-waste during Financial Year (FY) 2017-2018, FY 2018-2019 & FY 2019-2020 is given below:?	For FY 2017-18, the estimated generation of e-waste is 7,08,445 tonnes for 21 types of EEE. ?	For FY 2018-2019, the estimated generation of e-waste is 7,71,215 tonnes for 21 type of EEE. ?	For FY 2019-2020, the estimated generation of e-waste is10,14,961.2 tonnefor 21 types of EEE.(b)	&(c)	For the disposal of E-waste in an environmentally sound manner, Government has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. The regulations intend at taking all steps required to ensure that e-waste is managed in a manner which shall protect health and environment against any adverse effects, which may result from such e-waste. The said rules are effective from 01.10.2016and have the following specific objectives:?	Extended Responsibility to producers to manage a system of E-waste collection, storage, transportation and environmentally sound dismantling and recycling through EPR Authorization (EPRA).?	To promote and encourage establishment of an efficient e-waste collection mechanism.?	To promote Environmentally Safe & Sound Recycling through authorized dismantlers and recyclers of e-waste.?	To minimize illegal recycling / recovery operations.?	Reduce Hazardous substances in Electrical and Electronic components.The management of e-waste under the rules is primarily based on the principal of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Under EPR, the producers of EEE listed in the Schedule-I of rules have been given responsibility of management of their products once they have attained end of life. Under the E-Waste Rules, CPCB is issuing EPR authorization to the producers of EEE, wherein they have been given e-waste collection targets on annual basis. 1675 Producers have been given EPR Authorization as on date.The e-waste collection targets given by CPCB to EPRA producers during the FY 2018-19 was around1,54,242.74 tonne.  Further based on the annual returns submitted by 32 SPCBs/PCCs, around 1,64,663 tonne of e-waste was processed during FY2018-19. There are 407 authorized dismantlers/recyclers of E-Waste in the country having processing capacity of 11,10,103.22 tonne.(d)	& (e) The electronic products and electrical equipment after their useful life do not cause any harm to environment if stored and processed in an environmentally sound manner. However, if the E-waste is opened-up and unscientific methods are used for extraction of precious and semi-precious material from it, then it causes health risks and damage to environment. However, no specific studies to assess the damage caused by e-Waste on Environment have been carried so far. 		Under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, the safety and health of workers involved in dismantling and recycling of e-waste has been ensured through department of Labour or any other agency authorized in this regard by the concerned State government. As per the Rule 12(2) of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, Department of Labour in the State or any other government agency authorised in this regard by the State Government shall: is reproduced below:(a)	ensure recognition and registration of workers involved in dismantling and recycling;(b)	assist formation of groups of such workers to facilitate setting up dismantling facilities;(c)	undertakes industrial skill development activities for the workers involved indismantling and recycling;(d)	undertakes annual monitoring and to ensure safety & health of workers involved indismantling and recycling;*****
