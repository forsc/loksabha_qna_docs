ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	AND EARTH SCIENCES (Dr. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) Yes sir. Weather forecasting in different spatial and temporal scales is one of the major services of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).(b)-(d)IMD provides an operational Agro Meteorological Advisory Service (AAS) under theGramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme for the benefit of farming community in the country. Under GKMS, medium range weather forecasts (up to 5 days) at district level are issued. Based on these forecasts, Agromet Advisories are prepared and communicated by the 130 Agro Meteorological Field Units (AMFUs) located at State Agricultural Universities, Institutes of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Indian Institute of Technologies (IITs) etc. to the farmers on every Tuesday and Friday to take decision on day-to-day agricultural operations. AAS rendered by IMD is a step towards weather-based crop and livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production and food security besides reducing crop damage and loss due to unusual weather.IMD in collaboration with ICAR is venturing into implementation of block level AAS in the country. District Agro Meteorological Units (DAMUs) are being established in the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVKs) under the ICAR network. Implementation of block level AAS would address micro-level variation in weather and climate and hence, more number of farmers will be benefitted.(e)	Agromet Advisories are communicated to the farmers through multichannel dissemination system like print and electronic media, Doordarshan, radio, internet etc. as well as by SMS using mobile phones through Kisan Portal launched by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare and through private companies under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. At present, 42 million farmers in the country are receiving the Agromet Advisories through SMS directly. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of ICAR have also given link to the respective district level advisory in their web portal. A new mobile App viz., ‘Meghdoot’ has been launched by Ministry of Earth Sciences recently to help the farmers to get the weather information and related agromet advisories specific to their districts.
