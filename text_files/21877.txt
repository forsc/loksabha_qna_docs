                                                        THE MINISTER OF FINANCE (SMT. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)(a)	 - (e):    A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*******Page 1 of 3STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. *277 TO BE ANSWERED ON MONDAY MARCH 15, 2021 REGARDING DISINVESTMENT OF SCI (a):	Yes, Sir.(b):Based on the recommendations of NITI Aayog,Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 20.11.2019 accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of Government of India’s shareholding of 63.75% in Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer. Preliminary Information Memorandum/Expression of Interest (PIM/EoI) was floated on 22.12.2020. The last date of submission of EoIs was 01.03.2021 and date by which physical copies could be received is15.03.2021.  In response to PIM, multiple EoIshave been received. In the second stage of transaction,afterdue diligence by Qualified Interested Bidders (QIBs),Request for Proposal (RFP)would be supplied to QIBs for submission of financial bids. (c):As per the strategic disinvestment process, the sale price is determined based on the outcome of the financial bidding and the reserve value.  As such, it is not possible at this stage to specify the details of the amount likely to be accrued from the sale of stake.(d):NITI Aayog had been mandated to identify and recommend CPSEs for strategic disinvestment, which are not in ‘priority sector’, based on the criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign functions at arm’s length; and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose. These CPSEsare reckoned as ‘low priority’ for the Government notwithstanding that they may be profit making companies.  Strategic disinvestment is guided by the basic economic principle that the government should discontinue its engagement inmanufacturing/ producing goods and services in sectors where the 	Page 2 of 3competitive markets have come of age, and such entities would most likely perform better in the private hands.The unlocking of real value through better/ efficientmanagement anduse of latest technology by the private sector may bring much higher dividends for the economy as a whole in terms of growth, productivity and employment.(e):   Representations have been received from the Staff Union & Officers’ Association of the company to reconsider the decision.  Government intends to proceed with the decision taken by the CCEA.*****
