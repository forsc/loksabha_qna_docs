STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (C) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *453 TO BE ANSWERED ON 04.04.2022 ASKED BY  SHRITHOMAS CHAZHIKADAN REGARDING SKILL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES IN KERALA.(a)	The Government is implementing various Skill Development Schemes/Programmes across Central Ministries/Departments, for providing a range of Skill Development training programmes on pan India basis. Under Skill India Mission, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is delivering skills through following skill development schemes across the country including Kerala:S.No.	Schemes	Objective1	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)	With an aim to empower country’s youth and continue the journey of Skill India Mission in building India as the skill capital of the world, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) launched the third phase of its flagship scheme—  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 3.0) in January 2021. 2	Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme	Scheme of Jan ShikshanSansthan (NGOs) for Skill Development to impart vocational skills in non-formal mode to non-literate, neo-literates, persons with rudimentary level of education upto 8th and school drop-outs upto 12th standard in the age group of 15-45 years. The priority groups are women, SC, ST, minorities and other backward sections of the society.3	National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS)	This Scheme is for promoting apprenticeship training and increasing the engagement of apprentices by providing financial support to industrial establishments undertaking apprenticeship program under The Apprentices Act, 1961.  4	Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs)/ Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS)	This scheme is for providing long-term training through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) operational across the country.The ITIs offer a range of vocational/skill training courses covering a large number of economic sectors with an objective of providing skilled workforce to the industry as well as self-employment of youth.Other Ministries running important skilling programmes in the urban areas:Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAYNULM)”, in the States/UTs including Kerala, to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households on a sustainable basis. Under its Employment through Skill Training and Placement (EST&P) component, skill training is provided to the urban poor candidates in market-oriented certified courses for their placement in wage employment and self-employment opportunities. Ministry of Textiles is implementing an umbrella skilling scheme viz. Samarth- Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (Samarth), signifying the broad objective of the scheme to skill the youth for gainful and sustainable employment in the textile sector. Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC),through its Departmental and Non- Departmental training centres and through other promotional schemes, conducting Skill Development programmes in the country including Kerala State for unemployed youth to generate self-employment opportunities in traditional industries like beekeeping, Pottery, leather, agarbatti making, soap and detergent making,  Khadi spinning and weaving, baking and cake making etc.(b)	The number of people trained under various skill development schemes viz. PMKVY, JSS, NAPS and ITIs during last three years are attached at Annexure-I.(c)	PMKVY :	The numbers of persons who secured jobs in Kerala during last three years under schemeareas given below :   State	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	Reported Placed	Reported Placed	Reported PlacedKerala	6,501	8,263	1,213As per the Third-Party Evaluation Report on PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), it was found that average monthly income of PMKVY trained and certified individuals was 15% higher than the comparison group. Moreover, 76% of the candidates acknowledged that after the training, they have better chance of getting employment. JSS: The objective of training imparted under JSS is to link the individuals for gainful livelihood and supplement their family income through self-employment and wage employment. The providing of employment/placement to the beneficiaries is not the mandate of the JSS Scheme. As far as the employment of the JSS scheme beneficiaries is concerned, third party evaluation report of the scheme has mentioned, “It is finally observed that as an impact of the training programme conducted at JSSs, the self and wage employment and private job have become evident”. The usefulness of the scheme would be further self-evident from the fact that same report has mentioned that 77.05% of the beneficiary trainees have undergone occupational shifts. CTS: The final report of Tracer Study of ITI Graduates (published in January 2018 by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, GoI) mentions that 63.5% of total ITI pass-outs got employed (wage+ self, out of which 6.7% are self-employed).
