ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) Cases of queues arise in ‘FASTag lanes’ at fee plazas due to vehicles not fitted with “FASTag” or vehicles without valid, functional “FASTag” entering into it. In the hybrid lane, which accepts cash, queues arise because of non-FASTag vehicles. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 6 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, as amended, provides that vehicles not fitted with “FASTag” or vehicles without valid, functional “FASTag” have to pay double the applicable fee upon entering a FASTag lane at the fee plaza.(b) On arriving at the pay-axis of the toll booth, fee payment via FASTag can be done within 5 seconds, whereas in cash payment, it usually takes more than 40 seconds. Waiting time in FASTag lanes has significantly reduced after implementation of FASTag, which will further improve as the system gets more operationalised. However, the waiting time in the hybrid lane, which accepts cash, is relatively longer because of non-FASTag vehicles. (c) A robust customer redressal mechanism has been put in place to address various customer complaints. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has set up a dedicated Toll-free Helpline (1033) round the clock for complaints related to FASTag. Additionally, all member banks are mandatorily required to set up a dedicated Customer Care number to address FASTag customers’ complaints or queries.(d) The Government has taken various progressive measures for the adoption of FASTag, increasing efficiency of the FASTag programme and providing a smooth customer experience. In order to ensure easy availability of FASTag to vehicle owners, multiple channels like banks, petrol pumps, e-commerce websites, etc. have been engaged. The facility of instant recharge via UPI on various UPI -enabled Apps such as BHIM, Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc. has been provided. My FASTag App has been developed as a one-stop solution for FASTag customers, with facility to check real time balance status of FASTag. Further, NHAI is resorting to upgradation of the fee plaza system to facilitate real time transaction processing.
