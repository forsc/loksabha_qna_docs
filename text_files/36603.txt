ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)  Development of National Highways (NHs) is a continuous process and the Ministry takes up NH projects based on the requirements of connectivity, traffic density, inter se priority, and the availability of resources. 553 National Highways Projects in a length of 10,964 Km have been awarded during 2020-21. Expenditure incurred for ongoing works of National Highways (NHs) Projects during 2020-21 is Rs 1, 53,240 Crore. (b) The contributions received under Public Private Partnerships (PPP) mode during 2020-21 is Rs 12,476 Crore. (c) It has been estimated that 4076 mandays of work is created for every km of road constructed. In addition, a road project has a force multiplier effect on the economy that results in creation of indirect employment. (d) & (e) Construction works on National Highways were delayed to some extent due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the loss of time was estimated to be generally in the range of 3-9 months depending upon the project parameters. The Government has taken several steps under Atmanirbhar Bharat like, granting time extensions for 3 to 9 months, relaxation in contract provisions for ensuring cash flow, direct payment to sub-contractors and release of retention/security money to augment cash flow, waiver of penalty in case of delay in submission of Performance Security (for new Contracts), to expedite the construction work to achieve the target.***
