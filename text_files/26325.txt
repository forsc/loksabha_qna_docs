VAITHILINGAM, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 2nd AUGUST 2021 REGARDING KVs IN PUDUCHERRY.(a) & (b) Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are opened on the basis of availability of central government employees, land and temporary accommodation as per Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) norms, rather than on the basis of region / district / block etc.At present, 4 KVs are functioning in the UT of Puducherry i.e (i) KV No. 1 Jipmer Campus (ii) KV No. 2 Puducherry (iii) KV Karaikal, (iv) KV Mahe. KVS has not received any proposal in the prescribed proforma for opening of new KVs under civil sector from the UT Administration of Puducherry.Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable central government employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisite for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and also subject to approval of the competent authority.******
