The Government has revised the Post-Matric scholarship scheme for SC students  in March 2020 in order to further strengthen the implementation of the scheme. The main changes effected in the revised Post-Matric scholarship for SC students are as follows: i. The funding pattern has been revised from the concept of committed liability of the States to a fixed sharing ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and States (90:10 in case of NE states), thus reducing the financial burden on the States/UTs substantially.ii. Payment of the Central share directly by DBT to the students accounts w.e.f. 2021-22 onwards.iii. Focus on coverage of the poorest households.iv. Fixed timelines for application,  processing and disbursal.v. Simplification of processes for quicker processing, greater transparency, controlling duplication and wrongful claims by institutions etc.(c) & (d): This Ministry has been implementing the Scheme of Post-Matric Scholarship for Economically Backward Classes through States/UTs. Since 2021-22, the Government has clubbed this scheme with Post-Matric Scholarship for OBCs & others under an umbrella scheme namely PM Young Achievers’ Scholarship Award Scheme for vibrant India for OBC, EBC and DNT (PM-YASASVI).*****
