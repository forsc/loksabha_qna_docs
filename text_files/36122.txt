ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c) : Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, has awarded 948 valid routes  after completion of four rounds of bidding under RCS- UDAN. As on 17-03-2022, 409 RCS routes commenced connecting 66 airports have been operationalized including 2 Water Aerodrome & 8 Heliports. ;Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. However, there is a delay in operationalizing some routes/discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include:-;;i) Adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic.ii) Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which could be related to availability of land, creation of regional infrastructure, obtaining license from the Regulator etc.iii) Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes.;iv) Non-readiness of Selected Airlines Operators (SAOs);(d): AAI, the Implementing Agency, has awarded 46 routes under UDAN in the State of  Andhra Pradesh, out of which 26 routes have been operationalized by the SAOs.(e) & (f) : The Implementing Agency has awarded UDAN routes to SAOs for operation of the RCS flights from Kadapa airport on the RCS routes connecting to Chennai, Vijayawada, Hyderabad & Belgaum. These routes have completed three years tenure except Kadapa to Belgaum route which is completing 3 years tenure on 28.02.2023 and the SAO has not been operating on these routes at present. Any airlines can mount the flights on UDAN routes which have completed 3 years on commercial basis. Government has introduced certain policy reforms and relief packages for sustainability of operations of RCS-UDAN post COVID 19. These operational and financial flexibilities / relaxations and economizing measures are deemed mutually beneficial for all stakeholders by maintaining the benefit of air connectivity to passengers.******
