                                                        (a)  to  (c)	The Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) came into existence on 9th November, 2014 after bifurcation from Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports with the mandate to skill people to enable them earn their livelihood.  Since it was a newly created Ministry, there was shortage of manpower to handle the work.  However, as the time elapsed, adequate employees have been deployed by the Government in MSDE. 		National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is a not-for-profit public limited company incorporated on July 31, 2008 under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 which aims to promote skill development by catalyzing creation of large, quality and for-profit vocational institutions. The Government of India through MSDE holds 49% of the share capital of NSDC, while the private sector has the balance 51% of the share capital.  The appointments in NSDC at different levels are not done by the Government but NSDC itself. 		National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) is an autonomous body under Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship that anchors the National Skill Qualifications Framework and allied quality assurance mechanisms for synergizing skill initiatives in the country.  Since, MSDE did not have a separate Cadre and Budget allocation in the year 2014-15, year-wise details of employees appointed by the Government in MSDE and NSDA for the last four years (i.e. 2015-16 to 2018-19) is given as under:Year	MSDE	NSDA 	Number of Persons during the year	Exp.

As on 11.11.2019, 69.03 lakh (appx.) candidates have been trained in the country under PMKVY 2016-20.Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision for State-wise allocation of funds. Under this component, funds are released to NSDC which are subsequently released by NSDC on reimbursement basis at various stages of training (commencement of the training after validation, successful certification and placement) to the empanelled training providers and centres. Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, as on 11.11.2019, funds amounting to Rs. 5034.44 Cr. (approx) have been disbursed to NSDC for the implementation of this component.
