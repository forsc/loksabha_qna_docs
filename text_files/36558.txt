                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V.

The Mission also met officials from the UN Office in Geneva and the two Special Rapporteurs and urged them not to advance misleading narratives about India’s law enforcement authorities and the judiciary. ***
