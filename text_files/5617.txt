                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): Normally, Railway undertakes construction of Road over Bridges / Road under Bridges (ROBs/RUBs) in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  The construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion is undertaken when the State Government also is ready to commence their portion of work in approaches. However, this is delayed in approaches because it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, joint fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds by the State Government etc.(b): No, Sir.(c) & (d): For ROB/RUB, Railway take construction of Railway portion, wherein, generally there is no problem of land acquisition. Approaches are constructed by State Government for which sometimes there are delays in land acquisition which is to be acquired by State Government and Railway has no role. However, Railway persistently pursues the State Governments to expedite their work in approaches.*****
