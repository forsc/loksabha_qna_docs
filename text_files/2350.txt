                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (c) Works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.Central Assistance (CA) for restoration of water bodies is provided by the Ministry under the scheme of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, which is a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). The scheme aims at restoring the lost irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of existing water bodies. The restoration of water bodies also helps in ground water recharge. Works such as development of catchment, desilting, strengthening of bunds etc. are taken up for restoration of water bodies.Contd…P/2//2//Under the RRR of Water Bodies scheme, a total of 2064 water bodies with an estimated cost of Rs.1765 crore have been taken up for restoration in various states since XII Plan onwards as per eligible proposals received from the concerned State Governments, out of which 1160 water bodies have been reported to be completed upto March, 2019.

However, considering the importance of water bodies for socio economic development, Secretary (MoWR, RD & GR) vide letter dated 26.02.2016 requested State Governments to take necessary steps for keeping all the water bodies encroachment free. Further, Secretary (WR, RD & GR) vide letter dated 07.11.2016 requested the State Governments to take appropriate action in respect of inclusion of water bodies in land records, inclusion of water bodies as integral part of town planning process, strict action for the encroachers, etc.   Further, water bodies are included under RRR of Water Bodies scheme only after concerned State Government certify that these are encroachment free.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to Parts  (a) & (c) of Unstarred Question No. †2225 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 04.07.2019 regarding “Revival of Small Rivers and other Water Bodies”.Statewise details of ongoing RRR of Water Bodies SchemeAll Rupees in Crores, storage in MCM & Potential in Lakh HaSl.
