ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	The total amount of Uranium reserves in India as on February, 2021 is 3,50,438 tonne (t) in situ U3O8 (2,97,170t U).  State – wise details of uranium deposits are given in Table 1.(b)	In India, thorium is available in Monazite, a Prescribed Substance as per the Atomic Energy Act 1962. Monazite is found in association with suite of six other atomic minerals.  Development of technologies pertaining to utilisation of thorium has been a part of ongoing R & D activities in Department of Atomic Energy so that a mature technology is in place, well before the beginning of the large scale deployment of the thorium based reactors. With sustained efforts over the years, India has gained experience in different areas of thorium fuel cycle.  Large scale thorium utilisation is contemplated after a few decades of large scale deployment of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). In order to develop and demonstrate technologies for thorium based fuel, Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) has been designed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). It is also having advanced safety and passive engineered systems which enhance its safety. Efforts are currently on to enlarge the present thorium related R&D work and activities to a bigger scale and towards development of technologies for the third stage of our nuclear power programme. (c)	Highest priority is accorded to safety in all aspects of nuclear power viz. siting, design, construction, commissioning, and operation in line with codes and guides of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). State of the art safety measures are provided to ensure safe shutdown, cooling of the core and robust containment to prevent release of radioactivity in all situations. All nuclear power plants are designed to withstand extreme natural events like earthquakes, flooding, storms, tsunamis, etc likely at the respective sites. They are constructed to highest safety and quality standards and the operations are performed adopting well laid out procedures by highly qualified, trained and licensed personnel. The safety of nuclear power plants is continuously monitored and reviewed by the AERB. In addition, emergency preparedness plans incorporating effective measures are also put in place for the unlikely event of an emergency.*****
