ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (e): Depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of storage facilities, Government implements the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos in the country for central pool stock of foodgrains:..........2/--2-i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). A capacity of 142.62 Lakh MT (LMT) has been created as on 31.05.2019.  The State/UT-wise details of capacity created during the last 3 years, current year (up to 31.05.2019) and since inception of the scheme are at Annexure-I. Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. The time limit for construction of godowns under this scheme is 1 year without railway sidings and 2 years with railway siding. As per the agreement, the responsibility of delay in construction is on the part of investor/private party. The delay in construction of maximum up to one year may be allowed with a clause of similar reduction in the guarantee period.  In case of delay beyond one year of the agreement, appropriate decision is taken by State Level Committee (SLC)/High Level Committee (HLC) of FCI. The State/UT-wise status of ongoing projects under PEG Scheme (as on 31.05.2019) is at Annexure-II. ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 68,995 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments from 01.04.2016 to 31.05.2019. The State/UT-wise details of capacity constructed under the Scheme are at Annexure-III. The State/UT-wise details of ongoing projects under the scheme are at Annexure-IV. The State/UT-wise funds allocated, released and utilized for construction of godowns during the last 3 years and current year are at Annexure-V. The progress of construction of godowns is monitored and periodically assessed. It is ensured that funds are released only after the State Governments/FCI furnish utilization certificates.iii.	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.05.2019, steel silos of 6.75 LMT capacity have been created. The State/UT-wise details of capacity created during the last 3 years, current year along with the ongoing projects of construction of steel silos are at Annexure-VI. The State/UT-wise details of silos planned in the country as per the action plan/road map approved by Government of India are at Annexure-VII.  As per the concession agreement the silos are to be constructed within 2.5 years of signing concession agreement. The Concession Agreement which is signed between Government Agencies and private parties provide for penalties if the projects are delayed beyond the stipulated period. The silos are constructed in PPP mode and investment is done by the private parties. However, in case of silos constructed in Viability Gap Funding (VGF) model, the private party can seek grant in the tender. The grant approved by Ministry of Finance, Government of India for construction of silos in VGF model during the last three years and current year i.e. 2019-20 (up to 31.05.2019) is at Annexure -VIII.***Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2715 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 09.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State/UT-wise details of the capacity created during the last 3 years, current year and total capacity created since inception of PEG scheme are as given below:(figures in LMT)SL	State	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20(up to 31.05.2019)	Total capacity created since inception(as on 31.05.2019)1	Andhra Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.882	Bihar	1.07	0.45	0.10	0.15	3.553	Chhattisgarh	0.12	0.00	0.00	0.00	5.384	Gujarat	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.505	Haryana	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	34.376	Himachal Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.15	0.407	Jammu & Kashmir	0.08	0.20	0.07	0.00	1.638	Jharkhand	0.15	0.65	0.40	0.15	2.489	Karnataka	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	2.4110	Kerala	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.0511	Madhya Pradesh	0.95	0.21	0.15	0.00	13.0312	Maharashtra	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	5.6313	Odisha	0.10	0.20	0.28	0.00	3.5214	Punjab	0.40	0.00	0.00	0.00	44.6815	Rajasthan	0.00	0.15	0.00	0.00	2.3516	Tamil Nadu	0.40	0.55	0.00	0.00	2.5517	Telangana	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	2.6918	Uttar Pradesh	0.46	1.25	0.36	0.00	14.6419	Uttarakhand	0.00	0.10	0.00	0.00	0.1020	West Bengal	0.17	0.05	0.05	0.00	1.5421	Assam	-	0.25	0.00	0.00	0.25	Total	3.90	4.06	1.40	0.45	142.62**** Annexure-IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2715 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 09.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State/UT-wise details of ongoing projects under construction in Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme (as on 31.05.2019) is as given below:SL	State	Capacity (in MT)1	Uttar Pradesh	41,6602	Haryana	47,2303	West Bengal	90,0004	Bihar	2135	Odisha	5,0006	Madhya Pradesh	76,5007	Andhra Pradesh	25,0008	Tamil Nadu	10,0009	Jharkhand	60,00010	Jammu & Kashmir	86,66011	Himachal Pradesh	76,70012	Telangana	50,000	Total	5,68,963**** Annexure-IIIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2715 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 09.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State-wise capacity of construction of godowns under Central Sector (erstwhile plan) Scheme from 2016-17 to 2019-20 (upto 31.05.2019) by FCI is as below:- (Capacities in MT)SL	State	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2018-19 (upto 31.05.2019)	Cumulative capacity completed from 01.04.2016 to 31.05.20191	2	3	4	5	6	71	Assam	-	-	-	-	-2	Arunachal Pradesh	3,980	3,340	-	-	7,3203	Manipur	-	-	17,100	-	17,1004	Meghalaya	-	-	-	-	-5	Mizoram	-		-	-	-6	Nagaland	-	4,590	-	-	4,5907	Sikkim	-		-	-	-8	Tripura	-	-	-	-	-	Total	3,980	7,930	17,100	-	29,0101.
