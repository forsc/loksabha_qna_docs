(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Season-wise, year-wise, Company-wise and State-wise premium collected by insurance companies under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) since inception of the scheme are at Annexure.(b) & (c):	Number of farmer applicants has increased from 20% under erstwhile crop insurance schemes to 30% under PMFBY.   However, 2017-18 and 2018-19 being good monsoon years, pan-India coverage under the scheme is almost constant inspite the fact that two major States namely, Bihar and West Bengal had opted out of the scheme.Contd….2/-- 2 -(d):	Actuarial/bidded premium rates have been charged by the insurance companies under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS),  but farmers have to pay a low flat premium rate of maximum of 1.5% for Rabi, 2% for Kharif food and Oilseed crops and 5% for commercial/horticultural crop.  As per insurance principles, where yield variability is relatively less and low claims have been paid in the past, actuarial premium rates are comparatively very low like in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh etc., whereas in States like Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra etc. where yield variability is more and higher claims have been paid in the past, the actuarial premium rates are increased. (e):	No Sir.(f):	The amendment/revisions in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on it are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.
