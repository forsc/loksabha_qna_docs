MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): The Department of School Education & Literacy has issued a communication addressed toall States and UTs including Andhra Pradesh vide letter no. 1-4/2018-IS-3 dated 05/10/2018 to takenecessary action on the points given as under:(i) To not prescribe any homework for class I & II students in the StateBoard/Matriculation/Anglo Indian schools.(ii) To not prescribe any other subjects except language and Mathematics for Class I and IIstudents and language, EVS and mathematics for Class III to V students as prescribed byNCERT.(iii) To disaffiliate schools prescribing homework and non-prescribed subject for Class I and IIstudents and class III to V students.(iv) To formulate “Children School Bag Policy” reducing the weight of the School bags in the lineof guidelines issued by either State of Telangana or State of Maharashtra.(v) To form special squads to inspect the schools and prevent the use of non-prescribed booksThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 brought out by NCERT emphasizes upon shiftinglearning away from rote methods, connecting knowledge to life outside school, enriching thecurriculum to provide for overall development of children rather than remain textbook centric andmaking examination more flexible and integrated to classroom life.The NCERT has taken following initiatives in this context:(i) New syllabi and textbook reflects the NCF 2005 perspective on curriculum load and areinteractive and based on child centered pedagogy. The NCERT textbooks and other teachinglearning materials are available online on its website www.ncert.nic.in.(ii) NCERT recommends only two books (Language and Mathematics) for Classes I and II andthree books (Language, EVS and Mathematics) for Classes III to V.(iii) NCF 2005 suggests that autonomy should be given to the schools to develop their own flexibletime table so that school can teach two or three subjects each day giving students more time todo activities and develop deeper understanding of the concept. NCERT addresses this issue incapacity building programme for teachers and school heads.Also, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued circulars specifying the maximumnumber of books to be prescribed in classes I-VIII. They have also issued a Circular on 12/09/2016which provides detailed guidelines to schools, teachers and parents to reduce the weight of school bagsand vide circular dated 13/08/2018 advised schools to ensure no homework for students till Class II.(c) and (d): Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of the schools in thecountry are under the administrative control of the State Governments and UT Administrations, whoensure the implementation of guidelines/instructions issued from time to time.*****
