                                                    (a)	whether the Government is facing constant threat of tariff imposition and pressure from many countries to open up domestic market;(b)	whether foreign powers are constantly interfering in our internal business matters; (c)	if so, whether the Government is taking necessary steps to protect the interests of the country; and(d)	if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to (d): No Sir.  The government’s trade policy is framed based on its public policy imperatives including safeguarding the interests of its domestic industry. However, during bilateral discussions, the issue of tariffs and non tariff barriers are also raised by trading partners. Some of the measures taken for protecting the trade interests of the country are the recourse to trade remedial measures such as anti-dumping, safeguards and countervailing, monitoring the implementation of trade agreements, formulation of standards and technical regulations for ensuring appropriate quality of imports, integrated development of the logistics sectors and schemes and policies to facilitate trade such as Agriculture Export Policy, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) and Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA). *****
