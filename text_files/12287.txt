Crude oil production was affected due to various reasons, including inter alia, less than envisaged production, natural decline due to mature fields and reservoir issues in some of the fields, shutdowns taken for maintenance activities, increase in water cut, disruption in field activities due to bandhs.The percentage of crude oil import dependency during the 2019-20 (April-December) was about 84.9%.(d): The value of crude oil and petroleum products imported by the country during the year 2019-20 (April- December) are given below:Value (in ? Crore)*Crude Oil5,50,131Petroleum Products91,917*: ProvisionalContd.2/--2-(e): Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working in collaboration with various Central Government Ministries/stakeholders to make efforts to achieve reduction in import dependency on oil. The import reduction strategy broadly includes increasing domestic production of oil and gas, improving energy efficiency and productivity, giving thrust on demand substitution, promoting biofuels and alternate fuels/ renewables. Further, efforts are undertaken to increase the share of natural gas in the primary energy mix in the country by developing natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, CGD terminals and also promoting Compressed Bio Gas sector.*************
