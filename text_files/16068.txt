The Anganwadi Services under Umbrella ICDS Scheme envisages Anganwadi Workers & Helpers as honorary workers from local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development. In addition, all issues pertaining to implementation of scheme including appointment/recruitment of Anganwadi Staff rests with the concerned State/UT. As per norms, one post of Anganwadi Worker and one post of Anganwadi Helper is sanctioned for main Anganwadi Centre (AWC). For mini AWC only one post of AWW is sanctioned.(c)	POSHAN Abhiyaan focuses on building the capacity of front-line ICDS functionaries in effective and consistent manner by using Incremental Learning Approach (ILA). Under ILA, functionaries are being trained on thematic modules following the cascade of training of State Resource Group (SRG), District Resource Groups (DRGs) and Block Resource Groups (BRGs). Total 21 training modules are there as part of ILA. States/UTs are rolling out ILA Modules as per the guidelines. A digital version of ILA i.e. e-ILA has also been developed and rolled out. 9.94 lakh field functionaries have received training in ILA modules so far. Total 3.32 lakh field functionaries have completed e-ILA modules.(d)	State/UT-wise allocation of foodgrains made during last three years under Wheat Based Nutrition Programme at NFSA rates for Supplementary Nutrition Program is at Annexure-II.********* Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION No. 4440 FOR 20.03.2020 REGARDING CAPACITY BUILDING OF ANGANWADI WORKERS ASKED BY SHRI RAHUL GANDHIState/UT-wise sanctioned, in-position and vacant position of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as on 31st December, 2019S.
