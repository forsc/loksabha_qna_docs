The remaining 21 stations are targeted to be developed in Financial Year 2021-22 under Adarsh Station Scheme. Various passenger amenities such as improvement to façade of the station building, retiring room, waiting room (with bathing facilities), separate waiting room for ladies, computer based public address system, landscaping of circulating area, signages, Pay & Use toilets, water coolers, high level platforms, Foot Over Bridges, ramps at entry to station for Divyangjan and Senior Citizens etc. are provided at Railway stations identified and developed under the ‘Adarsh’ station scheme as per the respective category of the station.  Also, in order to facilitate easy movement of elderly, sick and for smooth access to platforms of major railway stations and for ease of movement, escalators are provided at Railway Stations having minimum footfall of 25,000 per day and above.Further, as a part of ‘Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan’ for differently abled passengers lifts at railway stations are provided depending upon relative priority of various stations and techno-economic feasibility for provision of lifts. So far (as on 30.06.2021), 83 escalators at 28 stations and 70 lifts at 27 stations including non-suburban stations in the State of Uttar Pradesh have been provided.In addition, 68 stations in the financial year 2018-19 have been selected for development under Soft upgradation.
