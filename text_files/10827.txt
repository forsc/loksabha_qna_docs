                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Yes Sir.(b)	The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) through the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), generates scientific information for implementation of Sustainable Development Goal-14, life below water to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. As a part of this endeavour, based on the sea water quality monitoring program, the sea water quality indices were derived and communicated to the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI), the nodal agency for the preparation of report on Sustainable Development Goals-National Indicator Framework (SDG-NIF). Further, in order to prepare a national policy and action plan to reduce plastic pollution in the marine environment, scientific studies have been initiated to determine the source, fate and distribution of plastics/microplastics. Similarly, ecosystem based studies have been initiated at Chilika Lagoon and Pulicat Lake to restore these fragile ecosystems.(c)	An amount of Rs 2.27 Crores, Rs 3.53 Crores and Rs.8.27 Crores have been allocated to NCCR to carry out the above activities for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively. However, there is no State/UT wise allocation.
