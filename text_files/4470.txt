                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 364, REGARDING "EXPANSION OF UDAN SCHEME" TO BE ANSWERED ON 18.07.2019 (a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. RCS - UDAN is market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. ; Except Goa, Mizoram, Chandigarh, Delhi, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep, 30 States and Union Territories have signed the tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India for operationalization of RCS - UDAN flights in their respective States. ; Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal on 06 March, 2017 for revival of existing unserved / underserved airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions. ;  27 Networks in first round of bidding, 90 Networks in second round of bidding and 95 Networks in third round of bidding were awarded under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) involving 706 RCS routes. 186 RCS routes have been commenced connecting 40 RCS airports. There are five(5) airports in the state of Maharashtra namely Kolhapur, Nanded, Ozar (Nashik), Jalgaon  and Sholapur.  Flight operations have already been commenced in Kolhapur, Nanded and Ozar (Nashik). Jalgaon Airport is ready for operations, but RCS flight operations are yet to start. Sholapur Airport is not ready at present, due to obstruction (chimney) in the flight path. There is one airport from the State of Madhya Pradesh namely Gwalior where RCS flight operations have already started. Financial statement spelling out the expenditure details in respect of airports under RCS-UDAN of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh is attached as Annexure. ;   ;
