ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	Yes Sir. The Government has taken initiative for adoption of viable craft clusters across the country and need based interventions like design & technology upgradation, marketing platforms, distribution of tool-kits, welfare programmes, seminar and awareness camps   have been provided to these clusters. Further, for formalization of clusters, artisan-based Producer Companies have been conceptualized and 56 producer companies have been formed across the country so far covering Export Oriented craft cluster, SC, ST, Women Clusters, linking with Tourism Spot and aspirational districts for overall development of cluster artisans. Total 138 clusters have been adopted in last three years in which 27 are in Uttar Pradesh, 9 in Maharashtra, 6 in Tamil Nadu and 4 in Tripura. State wise number of beneficiaries covered under Ambedkar Hastshilp Vikas Yojana and financial assistance provided to them in the last three years is enclosed in Annexure-I.(d) to (g): The evaluations have been done across the country to assess the cluster activities.  As per recommendation of the evaluation report, Govt. organized 670 chaupals/shivirs all over the country for providing Aadhar linked Pahchan cards, facilitating the artisans through MUDRA loan and for onboarding the artisans on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal and making them aware of the e-commerce market. Further, the revised Ambedkar Hastshilp Vikas Yojana (AHVY) Scheme, considering the recommendation of Evaluation Reports envisages taking up more viable craft clusters across the country covering SC, ST, Women, specially abled, tourism and export potential clusters. The Govt. continues to take up viable craft clusters across the country.
