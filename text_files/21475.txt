                        be pleased to state:-















(a) whether the demand for domestic coal was subdued in the second quarter of the current financial year due to lower demand from end-user industries amid the Covid-19 pandemic along with high inventory at power stations; and (b) if so, the steps taken/being taken by the Government in this regard?






ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): The outbreak of pandemic COVID-19 and imposition of subsequent lockdown resulted in subdued demand by power and non-power sector which adversely affected coal dispatch during the first quarter. The all India dispatch of coal during 1st quarter i.e. April-June of 2020-21 was 143.98 MT as compared to 185.11 MT with a negative growth of 22.2%.  However, during the second quarter of the current financial year i.e. July – September, 2020, all India domestic supply (offtake) increased by 5.4% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year which indicates an increase in demand during this period. (b): In the light of nation-wide lock-down and restrictions imposed by Central/State Governments in the wake of Covid’19 pandemic, the following strategies have been adopted by CIL in the current fiscal to generate demand in power as well as non- power sectors and for improving its dispatch and liquidating the stock further:•	To help improve Plant Load Factor (PLF) of power plants, minimum assured level of supply under Fuel Supply Agreements(FSAs) increased from 75% to 80% of Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ). •	To reduce financial stress, levy of Performance Incentive for Power Sector under FSAs waived off 2020-21. Now, the same dispensation has been extended from October’20 to entire fiscal year 2020-21.-2-•	To address liquidity crunch, Usance LC facility has been introduced for Power and Non-Power Sector consumers.•	Flexibility given to consumers for change of mode from Road to Rail and Rail to Road. •	Quantity up to 120% of ACQ has been offered in the current FY 2020-21 to all power utilities (except power plants having linkage under auction in terms of SHAKTI Policy).•	As recommended by Standing Linkage Committee (Long-Term) coal companies have been directed to enhance the ACQ for the hinterland power plants•	In order to meet the coal requirements of the coal importers through domestic coal, CIL has launched a new special spot e-auction scheme exclusively for the coal importers. As of April- February’21 such auctions were held in all the coal companies of CIL where against the offer of 327.50 LTe about 75.29 Lte was booked with around 18% percent increase over notified price.<><><>
