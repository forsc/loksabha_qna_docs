                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c)  Erosion, movement and deposition of sediment in a river are natural regulating functions of a river. Rivers tend to maintain a balance between the silt load carried & silt load deposited, maintaining a river regime. Soil erosion caused by heavy floods is a matter of concern as it leads to several associated problems like changes in river course, causing loss of land, etc. Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. The Government of India has been making continuous efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management and erosion control. Morphological Studies by various IIT and NIIT have been carried out for major rivers like Ganga, Sharda, Rapti, Kosi, Bagmati, Subansari, Krishna, Mahanadi Mahanada, etc. The These Studies aid in finding the vulnerable spots for bank erosion/deposition, aggradations/ degradation etc. As per the morphological study of Brahmaputra River conducted by CWC through consultancy from IIT Guwahati, it has been estimated that in the Brahmaputra river a total erosion of 252.6 sq.km and deposition of 118.6 sq.km occurred during 2003-05 and 2008-11. During XI Plan Government of India had launched Flood  Management Programme (FMP) for providing Central Assistance to States for works related to flood Contd…P/2//2//management and erosion control which continued during XII Plan and thereafter, as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21. Central Assistance to the tune of Rs.1286.39 Crores has been provided to State of Assam up to March 2021 under FMP component of this Programme.A list of anti-erosion projects taken up by the Water Resources Department of State Government of Assam during last three years in Kokrajhar is attached at Annexure-I.(d)   Data such as regions along with rivers facing erosion problems is not maintained centrally. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has identified river erosion in Assam in the catchment of Brahmaputra River near Golaghat, Marigaon, Dibrugarh, Dhubri, Sontipur and Dhemaji, erosion of Majuli Island is also observed. In Arunachal Pradesh, river erosion is identified in the catchment of Siang River near Kongkul and near Namsing.(e)  River basins are considered as the basic hydrological unit for water resources planning and management. The country is divided into 20 basins and mentioned in Annexuure II. These basins do not include the rivers of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of Ladakh Region.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2815 to be answered on 05.08.2021 regarding “River Erosion”ANTI-EROSION SCHEMES TAKEN UP DURING 2018-19 BY THE WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT 1) Schemes under RIDF-XXIV           												 (Rs. in Lakh)Sl.
