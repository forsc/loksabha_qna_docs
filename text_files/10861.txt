In the absence of any central regulatory body for Allied Health Professionals, this Ministry has taken the initiative for creation of a Central Council of Allied and Healthcare Professions and The Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 31.12.2018. The Bill is for maintaining standards of education and practice through the constitution of Central and corresponding State Councils for more than 50 Allied and Healthcare Professions including Physiotherapists. (c):	 Only a few States like Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh etc. have statutory mechanisms regulating allied and healthcare professions (Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy Councils/ paramedical councils).(d) & (e):	 No, The Central Government had constituted a ‘Standing Committee of Experts’ under the Chairmanship of Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research to consider and give its recommendations to the Government on the efficacy/merits of various streams of alternative medicine. The Committee had made various recommendations on the subject given to it and also suggested that the term “Doctor” should be used only by practitioners of system of medicine recognized by the Government of India. The recommendations were accepted by the Government and an Executive Order in this regard was issued on 25th November, 2003. Therefore, the prefix “Dr.” can be used by the practitioners of modern allopathic system of medicine, dentistry, and recognized system of medicine.
