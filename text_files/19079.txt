                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS				         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)to(c): The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, ‘Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihood Mission’ (DAY-NULM)to remove poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households. The Support to Urban Street Vendors (SUSV) component of the Mission aims at addressing livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security, etc. Ministry has launched, on June 01, 2020, the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme to facilitate collateral free working capital loans up to ?10,000 of 1 year tenure, to about 50 lakh street vendors to restart their business. It provides for incentives in the form of  interest subsidy @ 7% per annum on regular repayment of loan and cash-back up to ?1,200 per annum on undertaking prescribed digital transactions. ‘Letter of Recommendation’ (LoR) issued under the Scheme enablesthose Street vendors, who were either left out of the Survey or had started vending after completion of the survey or are from rural / peri-urban areas but vend in the urban areas, to avail the Scheme benefits. Socio-economic profiling of beneficiaries and their families has been launched to determine their eligibility for various government welfare schemes and to assist them in getting benefit of these schemes. Ministry is also facilitating Street Food Vendors to on-board e-commerce platforms.
