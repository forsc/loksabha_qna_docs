ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	: BVFCL is presently having two existing units viz. Namrup-Il and Namrup-lll. Namrup-ll plant established in 1975 had a major failure in January 2020 and was shutdown. Namrup-llI plant established in 1987 is operational but its performance has dropped due to obsolescence resulting in less production. To cope-up with this problem, financial aid of Rs.100Cr to BVFCL has been approved by CCEA on 10.02.2021 to ensure safe and sustained running of the existing Namrup-ll and Namrup-lll plants. Proposed Namrup-IV Project: In 2015, CCEA approved the proposal for setting up of new Brownfield Ammonia-Urea Complex (Namrup-IV) in the existing premises of BVFCL having capacity of 8.646 Lakh MT per annum through a JV under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode with equity participation of 48% (26%, 11% and 11% to OIL, Government of Assam and BVFCL respectively) on nomination basis and the remaining 52% equity through competitive bidding by inviting bids from public/private entities.  However, due to poor response from private parties, the possibility of equity participation of remaining 52% equity also on nomination basis to CPSEs, is in process.(b):  Local people of Assam are adequately represented in the existing plants of BVFCL.As far as proposed Namrup-IV project is concerned, there is no recruitment so far against the project, so the question of representation of local people is not applicable as of now.(c):   For the existing plants of BVFCL, almost entire recruitment in Workmen category is from the local people of Assam. Also, the manpower engaged through the Contractors is also from local people. Because of the existing plants of BVFCL, directly and indirectly, about 28,000 local people are benefitted. *******
