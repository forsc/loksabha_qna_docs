ANSWER




                                                         (a) to (d)	  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.*363 for 18.07.2019 raised by DR. MANOJ RAJORIA, Hon’ble M.P. on “LOW DRAFT VESSELS”  (a) & (b)    Inland waterways in India are characterized by low depths, especially during the lean seasons.   Accordingly, the cargo vessels for inland waterways are largely designed with low draft. 72.31 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of cargo has been transported on National Waterways during 2018-19 which confirms availability of adequate number of low draft vessels to cater to the requirement. 	As a component of Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP), designs of State-of-the-art low draft, high carrying capacity and fuel-efficient vessels have been finalized by engaging an international firm to meet the expected growth of cargo transportation through National Waterway-1 (Ganga).   The deigns are available in the public domain on the website of Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to assist concerned stakeholders for making available low draft vessels as per their needs.(c)     Low draft inland vessels are designed to carry bulk cargo for longer haulage whereas conventional type boats largely transport small cargo and passengers in a local area.   Therefore, livelihood of the people operating conventional types of boats will not be affected by the operation of low draft vessels carrying bulk cargo over long distances.  On the contrary, it is felt that operation of low draft vessels will help in improving the livelihood of the population in the vicinity of the waterways as it could improve connectivity, provide safe travel, foster better and faster business etc.   Moreover, it is appropriate for a developing country like India to make the transition from old, unsafe and conventional means of transportation to technologically improved, environment friendly, safe vessels.   (d)      Does not arise.                                             *****
