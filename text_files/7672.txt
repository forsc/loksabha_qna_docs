The NITs admit students through the Direct Admission of Students Abroad(DASA) scheme. The University Grants Commission (UGC) encourages theinstitutes/Universities for enrolling more foreign students in their courses forupgrading the standard of these institutes/universities. The Central Government andthe UGC are taking various measures to improve quality of higher education by wayof taking several initiatives so as to automatically attract foreign students to study inIndia. The UGC undertakes maintenance of standards in teaching, research andquality assurance in Universities, Deemed to be Universities and Colleges throughframing and notifying regulations, schemes and disbursing grants to the eligibleinstitutions. The UGC has notified several regulations with a view to sustain andimprove the quality of higher education and to undertake academic reforms.Moreover, one of the recent and prominent initiatives of Government of India isdeclaration of Educational Institutions as Institutions of Eminence (IoE) to provideworld class education to the Indian Students within the country. Twenty Institutionshave been recommended for status of ‘Institutions of Eminence (IOE). IOE schemehas been launched in order to implement the commitment of the Government toempower the Higher Educational Institutions and to help them become world classteaching and research institutions. It is expected that the above selected Institutionswill come up in top 500 of the world ranking in 10 years and in top 100 of the worldranking eventually. To achieve the top world ranking, these Institutions shall beprovided with greater autonomy viz. to admit foreign students up to 30% of admittedstudents; to recruit foreign faculty upto 25% of faculty strength; to offer online coursesupto 20% of its programmes; to enter into academic collaboration with top 500 in theworld ranking Institutions without permission of University Grants Commission; free tofix and charge fees from foreign students without restriction; flexibility of coursestructure in terms of number of credit hours and years to take a degree; completeflexibility in fixing of curriculum and syllabus, etc. In case of the private institutionsproposed as IOE, there will be no financial support, but they will be entitled for moreautonomy as a special category Deemed University.*****
