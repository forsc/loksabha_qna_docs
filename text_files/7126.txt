The total length of NHs has been increased from about 91,287 km in April 2016 to 1,32,500 km at present. The Ministry had taken up detailed review of NHs network with a view to develop the road connectivity to Border areas, development of Coastal roads including road connectivity for Non-Major ports, improvement in the efficiency of National Corridors, development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes along with integration with Sagarmala, etc., under “Bharatmala Pariyojana”. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the proposal for investment approval for Phase-I of “Bharatmala Pariyojana” during its meeting held on 24.10.2017.(b) to (e) Request was received for development of the Tembhurni – Latur road to 2-lane / 4-lane NHs standards. The stretch of State road was notified as NHs in January 2017. 	Development and maintenance of NHs is a continuous process.
