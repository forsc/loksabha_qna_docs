The programme has been sanctioned for implementation in 713 districts of the country. In addition, for tertiary health care facilities, 19 Regional Geriatric Centres and 2 National Centres for Ageing (NCAs) have been sanctioned under the programme The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has undertaken a Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) under the tertiary level activities of NPHCE to assess the health status of the elderly and to provide comprehensive longitudinal evidence base on health, economic, social and overall well-being of people aged 45 years and above in India.
