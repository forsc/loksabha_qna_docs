ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a):  During the formulation of National Education Policy 2020, a large number of consultations held with different stakeholders viz-a-viz State/UT Governments, Government of India Ministries, Members of Parliament, public etc. Before finalising the policy, a highly participative, inclusive and multi-pronged consultation process, through online, grassroots and thematic expert consultations, involving State Governments was carried out. After receipt of the Draft National Education Policy 2019 (Draft NEP 2019) from the Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. K Kasturirangan, the Draft NEP 2019 was uploaded on Ministry of Education?s website at https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/ files/NEP_Final_English_0.pdf and also at https://innovate.mygov.in/list-nep/ to elicit comments and suggestions from the various stakeholders. Further, letters were written to States/UTs Governments and Government of India Ministries inviting their views and comments on DNEP 2019. An Education Dialogue with Hon?ble MPs of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Karnataka & Odisha on three consecutive days i.e on 31.07.2019, 01.08.2019 & 02.08.2019. Two meetings, one with State Education Secretaries of School Education and another with State Secretaries of Higher & Technical Education was held on 09.07.2019 and 08.08.2019 respectively. Around 2 lakh suggestions on the Draft National Education Policy have been received from various stakeholders. A special meeting of CABE on National Education Policy was held on 21.09.2019, to discuss the National Education Policy.   26 Education Ministers of various States and UTs, representatives of States and Union Territories, Members of CABE, Heads of Autonomous Organisations, Vice Chancellors of Universities, attended the meeting along with senior officials of the Central and State Governments. A meeting of Parliamentary Standing Committee held on 7th November, 2019 to discuss the Draft National Education Policy. As per the procedure, inter-ministerial consultation on the draft Cabinet Note on National Education Policy 2020 was done. There has been wide publicity and positive feedback from all stakeholders. Accordingly, based on all feedback/comments received from various stakeholders on the Draft NEP, the Ministry finalized the National Education Policy, 2020 and the same has been approved by the Union Cabinet on 29.07.2020.	NEP envisages a curriculum and pedagogical structure which is more responsive and relevant to the developmental needs and interests of learners at all stages. In all stages experiential learning will be adopted, including hand on learning, art integrated and sports integrated and competency based learning and education.(b): In order to attain the goal of education with excellence and the corresponding multitude of benefits to this Nation and its economy, this policy unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in various critical elements and components of education such as ensuring universal access, learning resources, nutritional support, matters of student safety and well-being, adequate numbers of teachers and staff, teacher development, and support for all key initiatives towards equitable high-quality education for underprivileged and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in Education sector. In order to fulfill the objectives of NEP, the revised draft norms of existing schemes of Samagra Shiksha and Mid-day Meal (MDM) have been aligned with the recommendations of NEP 2020.****
