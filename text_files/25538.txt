ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (c): The Ministry addresses the issue of migration from rural areas to cities through a multi dimensional approach by creating avenues for employment and livelihood for rural people. In this regard, the Government is implementing various schemes/ programmes to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities. The details of the schemes/ programmes implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development are given below:-i.	Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS):	 The principal objective of the scheme is to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It stresses on creation of durable and sustainable assets to make the beneficiaries self-dependent.ii.	Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM): The Ministry is implementing DAY-NRLM to tackle the problem of unemployment, especially among women, in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take up economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty. Besides, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), the sub-scheme under DAYNRLM, has the objective of helping Self Help Group (SHG) and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector.iii.	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs): The Ministry is implementing two Skill development initiatives for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to improve the economic condition of the rural population, namely, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development scheme for rural poor and Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETI), which provides skilling, thereby enabling the trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.iv.	Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G): PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all rural houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas. The target under PMAY-G is to construct 2.95 crore houses.v.	Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY): PMGSY was started in the year 2000 with the objective to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The mandate of the scheme was subsequently widened and new interventions viz. PMGSY-II and PMGSY-III were added for upgradation of the existing rural road network which connect habitations to the various facilities and services. The implementation of the ongoing PMGSY has helped immensely in lifting the socio– economic conditions of rural masses by providing them access to the various services and facilities, market place and employment opportunities in various forms.vi.	Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM): Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission was launched on 21st February 2016 with an attempt to make the selected rural areas in the form of the cluster, socially, economically and physically sustainable regions by providing economic, social and infrastructure amenities, thus leading to sustainable and balanced regional development in the country. 300 Rurban Clusters with thematic economic growth points are proposed to be developed across the country under this innovative Mission. The Mission aims for holistic development of the clusters and once these clusters are developed, the augmentation of economic activities and basic amenities take place. vii.	National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP): It is a social welfare programme for the aged, widows, disabled and in the cases of death of the primary breadwinner belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households. It is 100% centrally funded Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS) implemented in the entire country including rural and remote areas.All these measures encourage people in rural areas to earn their livelihood and raise their quality of life near their places of residence and hence, act as a deterrent to migration of rural population to cities.(b)  Ministry of Rural Development has not conducted any survey in this regard. As per the information received from National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), according to NSSO survey on ‘Employment & Unemployment and Migration Particulars’ conducted during 2007 – 08, the estimates of migration rate at all India level was 28.5%. The rural-to-urban migration constituted 19.5 per cent of the total internal migrants.  There is no specific data about migration post 2008 available in this Ministry.*******
