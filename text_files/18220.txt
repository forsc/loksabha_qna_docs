ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): After three rounds of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN), pre-COVID, 688 valid routes were awarded, out of which 281 routes were operationalized  connecting 45 RCS airports & 5 heliports. After suspension of domestic flight operations from 25th March, 2020 to 24th May, 2020, domestic air services  including RCS operations have recommenced with effect from 25.05.2020. Airlines are resuming the commenced RCS routes in a calibrated manner.;;(c) & (d): No, Sir. However, Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) had to cancel some of the RCS flights due to bad weather conditions, poor visibility and technical snags considering the safety aspects of operations.(e): UDAN is strengthening the overall aviation network through reasonable pricing for air travel. Passengers are benefiting from enhanced air services and affordable air tickets. To incentivize the airline operators to fly RCS flights, following support scheme/regulatory measures have been introduced:-;;1.Central Government :i) Excise Duty at the rate of 2% on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) for SAOs at RCS Airports for RCS Flights for a period of three years from the date of notification of this Scheme.ii) Freedom to enter into code sharing arrangements with domestic as well as International Airlines pursuant to applicable regulations and prevailing air service agreements.;2.State Governments at RCS Airports within their States:i) Reduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) to 1% or less on ATF at RCS Airports located within the State for a period of ten years from the date of notification of RCS - UDAN.ii) Provision of security and fire services free of cost at RCS Airports.;3. Airport Operators:i) Airport operators shall not levy Landing Charges and Parking Chargesii) SAOs shall be allowed to undertake ground handling for their RCS Flights at all airports.iii) Airports Authority of India (AAI) shall not levy any Terminal Navigation Landing Charges (TNLC) on RCS Flights.iv) Route Navigation and Facilitation Charges (RNFC) will be levied by AAI on a discounted basis at 42.50% of Normal Rates on RCS Flights.;In addition to above, Central Government and State Governments provide Viability Gap Funding, which is shared between Ministry of Civil Aviation and the State Government in the ratio of 80:20 whereas for the States in North Eastern region/Union Territories (UT''s) the ratio is 90:10.
