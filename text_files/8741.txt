The States are responsible for maintaining law and order, protecting life and property of the citizens in their respective jurisdictions. States and Union Territories (UTs) have developed and launched mobile apps for providing citizen centric services, including services for the benefit of the senior citizens and to facilitate participative community policing. Details on such mobile apps including functionality or the languages in which these are available are not centrally maintained. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) through States and UTs. ERSS is based on a Pan-India, single, internationally recognized number i.e. 112 based emergency response mechanism for various emergencies, which is also accessible through the 112 India Mobile app.*****
