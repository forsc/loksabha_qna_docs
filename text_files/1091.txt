                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) and (b)	The Government had launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)] with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households in the country.  This is a demand driven scheme, hence there could not have been fixed annual targets.  Under SBM(G), 9.58 crore toilets have been constructed till 21.06.2019.  As a result, sanitation coverage in the rural areas of the country which was 38.7% on 2.10.2014 has increased to more than 99% and 30 States, 619 Districts, 6,174 Blocks, 2,50,133 Gram Panchayats and 5,65,395 villages have been declared ODF.  As SBM(G) is a demand driven scheme, fixed State-wise allocation of funds is not made under this programme.  However, State/UT-wise details of Central share funds released by the Government of India and utilised by the States/UTs including Karnataka under SBM(G) during the last three years, as reported by them on Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM(G), are given at Annexure.(c) 	Government has empaneled 36 Key Resource Centres (KRCs) who are specialized agencies in training and capacity building at the national level. The State Government can engage any or all these agencies to undertake capacity building training programmes at State, district and village levels.
