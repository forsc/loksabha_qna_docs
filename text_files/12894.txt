                                                        (a) to (f)	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.	   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (F) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 143 TO BE ANSWERED ON 02.03.2020 ASKED BY SHRI MANOJ TIWARI AND SHRIMATI VEENA DEVI REGARDING TARGETS UNDER PMKVY(a) to (c)	PMKVY (Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana) – 2.0 launched in the month of October, 2016 is targeted to impart skill training to 1 crore youth  for over 4 years (2016-20).  Under the scheme, 4 year targets were distributed year-wise as follows:Short Term Training (STT) 	Physical Targets2016-17	15,00,0002017-18	15,00,0002018-19	15,00,0002019-20	15,00,000Sub Total	60,00,000Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) for 2016-20	40,00,000Grand Total	1,00,00,000As on 17.01.2020, 40.27 lakh candidates have been trained under short term training (STT) and 33.20 lakh candidates have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country.(d)	PMKVY 1.0 was implemented for one year during the financial year 2015-16 whereas PMKVY 2.0 is being implemented during 2016-20.  Major changes brought out in PMKVY 2.0 with respect to PMKVY 1.0 are involvement of States for imparting skill training, affiliation and accreditation of training centres through online SMART portal, all job roles are NSQF aligned, mandatory Training of Trainers (ToT), etc. Further, various IT measures and interventions such as Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar linkage of trainers and trainees, Biometric attendance of candidate etc have been ensured under the new scheme. (e) and (f)	No, it is not a fact that due to the changes under PMKVY 2.0, a large number of small centres have become dysfunctional. However, under PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) in the year 2017 more than 2,500 training centres which were franchisee centres were not allocated targets because of not meeting the training quality.To enable erstwhile franchisee centres to convert themselves into TP owned centres, multiple efforts were undertaken by NSDC and MSDE viz. setting up of call centres, hand-holding workshops, developing user manuals, check list for physical inspection, etc.  Consequently, about 90% of such centres have again become eligible for allocation of targets.
