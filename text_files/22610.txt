ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) &  (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. RCS - UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. Since its inception, 56 RCS-UDAN airports including 5 heliports and 2 water aerodromes have been operationalised for operating RCS flights across the country.  Out of 56 RCS airports, 37 number of RCS airports are unserved airports and commercial operations have started, for the first time in these airports. Under UDAN, the commercial passenger flight services from Jagdalpur and Bilaspur airports in Chhattisgarh have already commenced. ;(c): After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market was deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs). Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDG. However, the Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity. Raipur airport is a licensed airport with scheduled commercial operations of flights. Under UDAN, Raipur is connected with Prayagraj, Jagdalpur and Jharsuguda.
