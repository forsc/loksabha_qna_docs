ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANADA GOWDA)(a):	With an objective of making quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all especially for the poor and the deprived ones, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals. Under this scheme, dedicated outlets known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) are opened all over the country to provide generic medicines to the masses. As on 02.03.2021, 7490 PMBJKs are functional across the country.  At present, the product basket of PMBJP comprises of 1449 drugs and 204 surgical instruments. Regular efforts are made for augmenting the product basket of PMBJP so that essential medicines and surgicals are readily available.(b) and (c):	The production and availability of scheduled medicines is regularly monitored by the NPPA mainly through the State Drug Controllers (SDCs) of the State Governments. Whenever shortage is reported by the SDCs or when the matter comes to the notice of NPPA, remedial steps are taken for ensuring availability of the drug by impressing upon manufacturers to rush the stocks to the places of shortage. No report regarding selling of   drugs at high prices due to scarcity in the country has been received by NPPA recently. However, whenever any information was received about non-availability of medicines at any place in the country, the same was immediately addressed and resolved. (d):	As per information provided by the Drug Controller General (India), no such storage limit is prescribed in the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Rules made thereunder. *******
