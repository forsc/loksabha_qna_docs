ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER of AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????             (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	During 2019-20 the import of Agri commodities was 19.91 USD Billion. 78% of the Agri import consisted of vegetables oil (48%) and Pulses (7%), fresh fruits (10%), Cashew nut (6%) and Spices (7%). The import of Vegetable oils and Pulses was undertaken with a view to bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply. Raw cashew is imported to process it into cashew kernel as we have huge processing capacity and resulting goods are partly exported. Further, fresh fruits are imported mainly due to preference for specific products in India. Among the various spices being imported, turmeric comes first in terms of quantity, as Indian turmeric is low in curcumin content which is the key ingredient to extract essential oils from turmeric.(b):	To reduce dependency on imported pulses and  edible oils; Government has been implementing various programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and National Mission on Oilseeds & Oil palm (NMOOP) to improve the production of pulses, and essential edible oils in the country. Besides, under RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY), funds are being provided to states for improving the production of pulses. To address high import of turmeric, steps are being taken to organize cultivation of varieties with high curcumin content in clusters in suitable areas.  To meet the growing demand of raw cashew nuts in the country, the government seeks to increase the area with high yielding varieties, high density planting, rejuvenation of senile orchards, canopy management, etc.(c):      With a view to ensure self sufficiency in agriculture, Government is also implementing flagship scheme of distribution of Soil Health Cards to farmers so that the use of fertilizers can be rationalize0d..“Per drop more crop” initiative under which drip/sprinkler irrigation is being encouraged for optimal utilization of water, reducing cost of inputs and increasing productivity.“ParamparagatKrishiVikasYojana (PKVY)” is being implemented for promoting organic farming.. Under e-NAM initiative farmers are being provided an electronic transparent and competitive online trading platform.Under “HarMedh Par Ped”, agro forestry is being promoted for additional income. Bee keeping has been promoted under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) to increase the productivity of crops through pollination and increase the honey production as an additional source of income of farmers.*********
