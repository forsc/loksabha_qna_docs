Further, as part of the Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, the Department in November 2014 had issued implementation guidelines to all States/UTs for the installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices with biometric scanners in all FPSs for transparent, efficient and ensured distribution of the subsidised foodgrains to all NFSA beneficiaries.(c) & (d): 	So far, the ePoS devices are installed in more than 4.98 Lakh (93.5%) of total 5.33 Lakh FPSs in the country.
