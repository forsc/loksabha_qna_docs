                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI SHRIPAD YESSO NAIK)(a) & (b):    Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules thereunder  encompass the provisions for prohibition of misleading advertisements and exaggerated claims of drugs and medicinal substances including AYUSH medicines and for the penalty to be imposed on the defaulters.  Central  Government has notified insertion of Rule 170 in the Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945 on 24th December, 2018 specifically for controlling inappropriate advertisements of Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicines.  Ministry of AYUSH signed an MoU with Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for two years to undertake monitoring of AYUSH-related advertisements in the print and television media and bring the cases of contravention of legal provisions to the notice of the State Regulatory Authorities for taking necessary action.   Department of Consumers Affairs in the Central Government has set up an online system called GAMA ((Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements) portal for registering public complaints of misleading advertisements of various commodities including AYUSH medicines and allied products. As a result of the monitoring done by ASCI,  732 cases of misleading advertisements of AYUSH products were reported in 2017-18 and 497 cases in 2018-19.   456 cases of violation of the provisions of Drugs & Magic Remedies Act, 1954 in 2017-18 and 203 cases in 2018-19 were escalated to the State Regulators for taking necessary action in accordance with the legal provisions.  (c) & (d):  State/UT Governments are empowered to enforce the provisions of  Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules there under and Drugs & Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules there under.   Accordingly, directives have been issued to the States /UTs for appointing Officers to enter, search any premises or examine or seize any record related to the alleged misleading or improper advertisements and initiate action against the cases of default. Pharmacovigilance Centres for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) Drugs set up in different parts of the country under the Central Scheme of Ministry of AYUSH are also mandated to monitor and report the misleading advertisements to the respective State Regulatory Authorities.   The cases of misleading advertisements brought to the notice of Ministry of AYUSH are individually forwarded to the concerned State/UT authority, media channel and the manufacturer for prohibitive and regulatory action. …………………….
