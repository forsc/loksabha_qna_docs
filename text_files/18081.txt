ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b) 	As per the extant regulatory framework for tariff, tariffs for telecommunication services are forborne except for: (i) rural fixed line services; (ii) national roaming services; (iii) international private leased circuits and domestic leased circuits; and (iv) mobile number portability charges. Thus, the telecom service providers have complete flexibility to decide various components of tariff including the validity and other terms and conditions of services as per their commercial requirements subject to adherence to broad regulatory principles of transparency, non-discrimination and non-predation. ************
