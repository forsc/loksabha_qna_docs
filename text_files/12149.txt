                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e): 	Sale and distribution of drugs is regulated in terms of the provisions of the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Drugs & Cosmetics Rules, 1945 made thereunder through a system of licensing and inspection.          As per the provisions of the Act and Rules, drugs included in Schedule H, H1 and X are required to be sold by retail only on the prescription of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP). This provision is applicable to the State of Tamil Nadu also. The State Licensing Authorities are empowered to take action on any violation of the conditions of sale license.        Concerns have been received from time to time regarding sale of prescription drugs by retail without prescription of Registered Medical Practitioners. Accordingly, State/UT Drug Controllers are requested to sensitize their enforcement officials from time to time to keep strong vigil to ensure that such drugs are not sold by retail without prescription of Registered Medical Practitioners and that they are sold in accordance with Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder.       In this regard, various advisories have been issued to all stakeholders including State & UT Drug Controllers and the last such advisory was issued on 23.12.2019.     As per the information received from the Government of Tamil Nadu, 282 cases have been filed, during the period from 01.04.2019 to 31.01.2020, against the sale concerns for having sold the prescription drugs without the prescriptions of registered medical practitioners.
