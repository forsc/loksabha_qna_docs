                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b)	Yes Sir, Government is aware that there are incidents of unsolicited commercial communications in the country.Government has undertaken an analysis of the complaints received by service provider from customers regarding receipt of Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC) during the year 2019 (upto May). The details in this regard are given below: <pre>Months	Unregistered Telemarketers	Registered Telemarketers	TotalJan, 2019	50519	61200	111719Feb., 2019	51858	53760	105618March, 2019	54239	54071	108310April, 2019	50033	48111	98144May, 2019	37788	42042	79830</pre>From the above analysis of the complaints received by service providers, it is seen that the number of complaints relating to UCC has declined during the current year.  For addressing the menace of UCC effectively, TRAI had reviewed the framework for controlling UCC and laid down a revised framework controlling UCC on 19.07.2018 through the Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation, 2018. These regulations are under implementation and have paved the way for effective control of UCC.(c) to (f)	As per the regulations, a customer, who has registered his telephone number for not receiving UCC, may make a complaint about receipt of UCC to his service provider. The service provider from whose network the UCC had originated has to take action on the complaint as per the regulations. However, some of the consumers have also made complaints to TRAI.  Since as per the regulations the service providers have to take action on complaints, the same are forwarded to the service providers for necessary action. Since September 2011, based on consumer complaints, the service providers have so far disconnected telecom resources of 18,19,470 Unregistered Telemarketers and blacklisted 5,89,589 such unregistered telemarketers.  Also a penalty of Rs. 4,16,45,000/- was deducted from the security deposit of Registered Telemarketers and deposited with TRAI.  Further 16 Registered Telemarketers were Blacklisted.  The details of the complaints received in TRAI during the last three years and current year upto 10.7.2019 are given below:<pre>Telecom Service Providers	2016	2017	2018	2019(upto 10.7.2019)MTNL	0	0	1	0BSNL	9	8	5	1Aircel	0	2	1	0Airtel	51	106	159	70Idea	18	27	21	6R-CoMM	3	1	2	0R-Jio	0	1	15	11Tata Tele Services	0	4	3	0Telenor/Uninor	0	0	1	0Vodafone	80	128	161	67Total	161	277	369	155</pre>
