                                                          THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS      (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	&   (b)    No Sir.

(2)      Where failure on the part of the designated authority, contractor, consultant or concessionaire responsible under sub-section (1) to comply with standards for road design, construction and maintenance, results in death or disability, such authority or contractor or concessionaire shall be punishable with a fine which may extend to one lakh rupees and the same shall be paid to the Fund constituted under section 164B.”
