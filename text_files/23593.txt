ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION 				(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	& (b) The Ministries/Departments of the Government of India conduct evaluation of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) being implemented by them.  The NITI Aayog also conducts concurrent evaluation of the selected programmes/schemes.  Besides this, in States, the State evaluation offices conduct evaluations of their prominent schemes/programmes. For the continuation of Central Sector (CS)/Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in 15th Finance Commission Cycle, the Department of Expenditure in March 2019 entrusted Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog to undertake evaluation of 28 Umbrella Centrally Sponsored Schemes comprising around 125 CSS. These schemes have been evaluated under 10 Evaluation Packages and finalized evaluation reports have been shared with the concerned stakeholders. The details of CSS programmes evaluated by Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog through the 10 packages are enclosed as Annexure-A.(c)	The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance allocates funds every year, to Ministries/Departments. The respective Ministry/Department facilitates the implementation of schemes, releases the funds to the States/implementing agency, time to time and are expected to monitor that the funds are utilized in efficient and effective way. Further, continuation of schemes from one Finance Commission cycle to another entails a third party impact evaluation.(d)	& (e) While the programme implementing Ministries/Departments are primarily responsible to monitor the implementation of their programmes and for taking corrective steps to ensure that the programme benefits reach the targeted population, the NITI Aayog helps them in the following ways:•	By bringing findings of the evaluation studies to the knowledge of the programme implementing Ministries/Departments for taking corrective measures;•	NITI Aayog facilitates monitoring of the progress in the implementation of programmes/schemes through Output-Outcome Management framework (OOMF) for CS/CSS Schemes of the Government of India. NITI Aayog has also developed a dashboard for this purpose which is accessed online by the Departments/Ministries for updating the progress of their progammes.***** Annexure – ADetails of 10 CSS packages evaluated by DMEO, NITI Aayog (2019-21)Sl.
