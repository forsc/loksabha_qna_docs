ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) For inclusion of a project for funding under National Projects (NP) scheme of this Ministry, it is required to be first appraised by Central Water Commission (CWC), and accepted by the Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose Projects of this Ministry. Thereafter, investment clearance is required to be obtained by the State Government. Subsequently, if the project meets the laid down norms for the NP scheme, it is required to be considered by the High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) set up for the purpose. On being recommended by HPSC, and as per availability of funds etc., Government of India may approve inclusion of a project under the NP scheme.  Subsequent to acceptance by Advisory Committee in December, 2020 and grant of investment clearance in March, 2021, Upper Bhadra project has been recommended by HPSC for inclusion under NP scheme, in its 14th Meeting held in February, 2022. However, its inclusion under NP scheme shall require specific approval of Government of India.  Central assistance for the project shall be available only once the project is included under the NP scheme.  (b) Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has accorded environmental clearance for Upper Bhadra Project vide letters dated 05.01.2010 and 10.07.2017.  (c) As per the latest Guidelines of NP scheme published in 2022, the funding pattern under the NP scheme is as below:   Sl. No.	Category 	Funding Pattern 	Projects in 8 North-Eastern,2 Himalayan States (Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh	90 (Central) : 10 (State)2.	 	Projects in other States	60 (Central) : 40 (State) Thus, in the event of Upper Bhadra project being included under the NP scheme of this Ministry, it shall be eligible for central assistance as per sl. no. 2 of the above table. However, central assistance shall be on the balance cost at the time of inclusion of the project under the scheme, limited to the works component for the scope of work approved under NP scheme.  *****
