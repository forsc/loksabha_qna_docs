The incentives to ASHAs for different tasks are regularly reviewed from time to time. Accordingly, Government of India has recently approved increase in the amount of routine and recurring incentives under National Health Mission for ASHAs that will enable ASHAs to get at least Rs 2000/- per month subject to carrying out assigned tasks.  Further, the Government has also approved enhancement of supervisory visit charges for ASHA facilitators from Rs. 250/-per visit to Rs. 300/- per visit. Further, benefits of Life insurance, accident insurance and pension to eligible ASHAs and ASHA facilitators are extended by enrolling them under:•	Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (premium of Rs. 330 contributed by GOI)•	Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Beema Yojana (premium of Rs. 12 contributed by GOI)•	Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi MaanDhan (50% contribution of premium by GOI and 50% by beneficiaries).•	The government has also approved a cash award of Rs. 20,000/- and a citation to ASHAs who leave the programme after working as ASHAs for minimum of 10 years, as acknowledgement of their contribution.•	To enhance competency and professional credibility of ASHAs by knowledge and skill assessment, ASHA Certification programme has been launched in 2014 which is being currently implemented in 23 States and 1 UT.  •	35 State training sites and 95 district training sites have been accredited by National institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).  •	179 state trainers and 468 district trainers have been certified by NIOS. •	About 6212 ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators have been certified. As per the information given by the State of Bihar, ASHAs are getting 52 types of Performance Based Incentives under various Programs of NHM and one incentive for the activity under Jan Arogya Yojana from State fund. State is taking following initiatives to ensure timely payments to the ASHA including districts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur, Madhubani and Darbhanga:•	Bihar has started payment to the ASHA through PFMS (Public Financial Management System) portal. Till date 99 % ASHAs are registered on PFMS and Aadhaar linked payment is being done through PFMS. •	A standardized Claim Format has been distributed to all selected ASHA in order to ease the payment.•	A decision has been taken by Govt. of Bihar to provide Rs. 4,00,000 (Four Lacs) to the nearest dependant of an ASHA in case of her death.
