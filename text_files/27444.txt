                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTERY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d) After recording the first peak COVID-19 trajectory in India with 97,894 cases on 17th September, India was recording a sustained and considerable decline in number of daily new cases. India’s active caseload was as low as 1.48% of India’s total positive cases. Further the COVID-19 outbreak was contracting since only two States namely Kerala and Maharashtra were accounting for more than ~70% of total active cases in the country. This was further corroborated by the fact that more than 400 districts were reporting less than 10 cases with a test positivity of less than 1% which shows that the transmission was limited. This decline was also evident in terms of test positivity rate which had fallen to less than 5% in more than 25 States which indicated that the spread of infection was on the decline. Government of India had acknowledged the hard work done by the healthcare, frontline workers and community at large and had continuously highlighted the need to focus on COVID appropriate behavior and use of vaccine.
