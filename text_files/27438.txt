ANSWER




ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE          (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c): The Hon‘ble High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition Civil (WPC) No. 11819/2016 vide judgment dated 17.09.2019 directed the Central Government to consider afresh the application of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) for grant of recognition to the Post Graduate Diploma in Clinical Cardiology (PGDCC) qualification.  Accordingly, the application dated 04.11.2019 of IGNOU was considered by the erstwhile BoG-MCI in its meeting dated 18.12.2019 and decided not to recognize PGDCC course of IGNOU. After the constitution of the National Medical Commission(NMC), the NMC in their meeting held on 16.03.2021 re-considered the matter and unanimously resolved that the PGDCC qualification awarded by IGNOU from 2006 to 2013 cannot be recognized.Further, the National Medical Commission Act, 2019 under Section 35(5) provides for appeal to NMC within the specified time against the decision of Boards for not granting recognition to a medical qualification.  Also Section 35(7) of the Act, has a provision of second appeal to the Central Government within the specified time against the decision of the Commission.
