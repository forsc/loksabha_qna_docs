PRITAM GOPINATHRAO MUNDE AND SHRI SRIRANGA APPA BARNE REGARDING MINIMUM WAGES ACT TO ALL FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKERS(a) to (d):	The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security; and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. The draft Labor Code on Wages, inter-alia, addresses issues relating to minimum wages, payment of wages, payment of bonus, equal remuneration etc and is at pre-legislative stage.  *******
