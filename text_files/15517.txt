ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ****   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 374 FOR REPLY ON 19.03.2020 ASKED BY SHRI SHRIRANG APPA BARNE AND SHRI BIDYUT BARAN MAHATO REGARDING COMMONWEALTH SHOOTING AND ARCHERY CHAMPIONSHIPS  (a) & (b) Shooting and Archery are not compulsory sports under the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) Constitution and were not included in the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. However, the Government has also constantly taken up the issue of inclusion of the ‘Shooting’ in the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games with the CGF, Organizing Committee of Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 as also with the concerned authority in UK Government. With the combined efforts of this Ministry, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the National Rifle Association of India, the CGF has agreed to hold ‘Shooting’ and ‘Archery’ Championships in India in advance of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games with the legitimacy of medals of these events as part of the final tally for the XXII edition of the Commonwealth Games. These events will be held in Chandigarh in January 2022.  (c) & (d) While seeking in-principle approval of this Ministry IOA has indicated approximate estimated cost of Rs.10.00 crore and Rs.3.50 crore towards organising ‘Shooting’ and ‘Archery’ events, respectively, in India apart from the venue / infrastructure facilities. Competition venue which include Shooting ranges of 50 metres, 25 metres, 10 metres, etc. and Archery field for Recurve and Compound events would be required for the Shooting and Archery events. According to National Rifle Association of India, UT Administration of Chandigarh is on its own in the process of upgrading the existing shooting ranges and facilities to the international standard and the tentative time frame for completion is 12 months and the same facilities would be used for Commonwealth Shooting Championship 2022. (e) Hosting of Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships would provide opportunities to the Indian athletes to compete in an international event at home-ground.  ***
