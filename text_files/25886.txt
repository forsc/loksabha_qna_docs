ANSWER




                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (e) Yes, Sir.  Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities. Selection of 100 Smart Cities was completed through 4 rounds of selection from January 2016 to June 2018.  The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, give a decent quality of life and foster clean and sustainable environment through application of `Smart’ solutions. Illustrative elements in a Smart City may include, inter alia, assured supply of water and electricity, adequate sanitation facilities, efficient mobility, affordable housing, vibrant public spaces, robust IT infrastructure, good governance, health and education, etc. There is no universal template of a smart city. The idea of smart city and the consequent prioritization of projects have been developed by each of the Smart Cities after a comprehensive exercise of citizen engagement. In line with the strategy of comprehensive development of areas under Smart Cities Mission, convergence with other Central and State Government Schemes is important for achieving the objectives of the Mission. While conceptualizing their Smart City Proposals (SCPs), cities were encouraged to seek convergence with other Government programs including Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), Housing for All, Digital India, Skill development etc. Such convergence enables integrated, sustainable and inclusive development and supports the idea of the Mission to look at compact areas, create replicable models which act as lighthouses for other areas in the same city/ other aspiring cities.As on 9 July 2021, these cities have tendered out 6,017 projects worth Rs. 1,80,873 crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 5,375 projects worth Rs. 1,49,251 crore; out of these, 2,781 projects worth Rs. 48,150 crore have been completed. There has been more than 260% growth in projects tendered and more than 380% growth in projects grounded/completed in the last three years. Government of India has released Rs.23,925.83 crore as the Central share to the States/Union Territories out of which Rs. 20,410.14 crore (85%) has been utilized by the Smart Cities.                                      *****
