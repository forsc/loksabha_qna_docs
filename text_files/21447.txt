ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) and (b) :	As per Section 13D of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, the electoral roll for every parliamentary constituency shall consist of electoral rolls for all the assembly constituencies comprised within that parliamentary constituency, and it shall not be necessary to prepare or revise separately the electoral roll for both Lok Sabha and State Legislative assembly elections as of now.	Electoral rolls for conduct of elections to the Urban Local Bodies and Panchayat Raj Institutions are prepared by the respective State Election Commissions (SECs). As informed by the Election Commission of India (ECI), twenty five States and eight Union territories are presently using the electoral roll data prepared by the them for preparing their electoral roll for local bodies/Panchayat elections.  Use of common electoral rolls will result in saving of time and energy since duplication of efforts by the SECs could be obviated.******
