ANSWER




                                                        (a),(b)&(c): Beypore road connectivity to Malaparamab beach with a length of 18 Km in Kerala is included in the list of Port connectivity Road stretches under Bharatmala Pariyojana phase-I. In the meeting held on 10.10.18 under Chairmanship of Secretary, MORTH, it was decided that port connectivity road under Bharatmala Pariyojana would be taken up by MoRTH/NHAI subject to condition that State Government should prepare the estimates/DPRs for the projects and born entire cost of land acquisition and utility shifting.  In another review meeting held on 19th June, 2020 under the chairmanship of Secretary, MoRTH, it was decided to expedite the connectivity projects providing direct connectivity to the operational/substantially developed ports with priority for the ones having  pre-construction activities and accordingly, Ministry of Shipping vide Office Memorandum dated 9th September, 2020 shared the priority list of 68 road connectivity projects, which includes above connectivity project also, for implementation under Bharatmala Pariyojna. (d)  National Center for Coastal Research (NCCR), Ministry of Earth Sciences, Chennai has studied the shoreline changes along Indian coast for year 1990-2016. In this study it is found that about 62% of Kozhikode district coastline is experiencing varying degree of erosion. The low erosion has been noticed on the either side of Beypore fishing harbour. The result of shoreline changes along Kozhikkode are summarised below:-. <pre>  District	Total Coastline  length       (in km)	Coastline length (in km)		High Erosion	Moderate Erosion	Low Erosion	Stable	Low Accretion	Moderate Accretion	High AccretionKozhikkode	78.03	0.46	0.84	47.56	24.93	3.74	0.24	0.26                                                                      </pre>Planning and execution of anti-sea erosion measures are undertaken by the maritime States/UTs as per their own priority and from their own resources. The role of Union Government is technical, advisory and catalytic in nature. However, there is provision for providing central assistance to State Governments for taking up critical sea erosion works under FMBAP scheme as per guidelines.****
