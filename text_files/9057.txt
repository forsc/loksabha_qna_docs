The approval is granted only after the concerned State Government recommends the setting up of the SEZ.  After the approval, the implementation of SEZ projects by developers is monitored by the Development Commissioners as per SEZ Act and Rules on a regular basis.  Based on such monitoring, in case of violation of SEZ Act/Rules, action is initiated against the Developers to recover any fiscal benefit availed by them as well as to penalise them for the violations. De-notification is done based on recommendation of concerned Development Commissioner and after obtaining the No-objection from the State Government concerned as well as Department of Revenue.  Further, in terms of Rule 11(9) of the SEZ Rules, 2006, sale of land in an SEZ is not allowed.*****
