                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b)	During 2009-10, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducted comprehensive environmental assessment of 88  identifiedindustrial clusters across the country and rated them on concept of Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI). Out of these 88 industrial clusters, 43 industrial clusters had  CEPI scores more than  70 and were identified as Critically Polluted Areas (CPAs) and 32 industrial clusters  with CEPI score between 60-70 were considered as severely polluted areas (SPAs). List of CPAs and SPAs as per 2009-10 monitoring is attached as Annexure-I.CPCB carried out CEPI monitoring biennially for  43 CPAs during 2011, 2013 (Annexure-II) .During 2016, CPCB carried out revision of CEPI criteria and conducted environmental quality monitoring in 100 identified industrial areas across the country based on revised CEPI- criteria and identified 38 CPAs and 31 SPAs. The list of 100 industrial areas with CEPI score are provided at Annexure-III.(c) & (d) The CPCB has taken various steps to curb the environmental pollution in each CPIC . The year-wise details of action taken by CPCB are as below:2009: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi had carried out comprehensive environmental assessment of 88 prominent industrial clusters during 2009-10 based on Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) criteria.2010: Based on CEPI, MoEF&CC, Govt. of India has imposed temporary moratorium on consideration of new projects /expansion of existing projects for environmental clearance to be located in 43 Critically Polluted Areas, vide Office Memorandum, dated 13.01.2010. Remedial Action Plans were formulated by concerned State Pollution Control Boards in co-ordination with CPCB for the CPAs falling under their jurisdiction.2011:  MoEF&CC decided to lift the moratorium on the basis of statements furnished by concerned State Pollution Control Boards, to the effect that some work has been initiated in line of the submitted action plans. Therefore, the SPCBs were directed to submit the progress reports on the initiation of implementation of Action Plans. Based on the inputs received from SPCBs on initiation of ground work in implementation of action plans, MoEF&CC lifted the moratorium from 26 Critically Polluted Areas, vide their O.Ms., dated 26.10.2010, 15.02.2011, 31.03.11, 23.05.2011, & 05.07.11 respectively, however, in respect of the remaining 17 CPAs, moratorium was continued till further orders. The progress made in the implementation of these action plans was being periodically reviewed by the Local Committees and it is noted that the effective implementation of these action plans would help in the restoration of environmental quality of these 43 areas.  2011:  Simultaneously, environmental quality monitoring was also being carried out by CPCB periodically and CEPI were re-assessed based on the recorded monitoring data in the CPAs.2013:  Thereafter environmental quality monitoring conducted in 2013, CEPI has been re-assessed and accordingly MoEF&CC has lifted the moratorium in 10 CPAs and also re-imposed the moratorium in 8 CPAs vide its OMs dated 17.09.2013.2016: CPCB has revised CEPI concept in concurrence with MoEF&CC by eliminating the subjective factors but retaining the factors which are monitor able and subsequently issued directions under section 18(1) (b) of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 on 26.04.2016 to all SPCBs/PCCs having CPAs for adoption of the revised CEPI concept, which includes environmental quality monitoring in all the CPAs, installation of continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, installation of continuous water quality monitoring stations, application of revised CEPI version and action plan & monitoring.2017: MoEF&CC, sanctioned a project on ‘Monitoring, sampling and analysis for ambient air quality, surface water quality and ground water quality in 100 Polluted Industrial Ares (PIAs)’ during 2017-18 to CPCB to carry out environmental quality monitoring in 100 PIAs as per the revised CEPI.2018:	CPCB completed the environmental quality monitoring in association with SPCBs/PCCs by engaging approved four laboratories in 100 identified industrial clusters across the country. The environmental quality data and other information received from SPCBs/PCC and hospitals were processed for evaluation of CEPI score as the revised CEPI-2016.(e )	MoEF&CC, Govt. of India had imposed temporary moratorium on consideration of new projects /expansion of existing projects for environmental clearance in 43 Critically Polluted Areas, vide Office Memorandum, dated 13.01.2010. As per the direction of MoEF&CC, remedial Action Plans were formulated by concerned State Pollution Control Boards for the CPAs falling under their jurisdiction. The progress made in the implementation of these action plans were periodically reviewed by the Local Committees and it is noted that the effective implementation of these action plans helped in the restoration of environmental quality of these 43 areas.  Based on progress in implementation of action plan moratorium has been lifted. The areas where there was no improvement in the environmental quality, the moratorium continued.  As per that assessment, the status of moratorium till 2018 is provided at Annexure-IV.(f )	MoEF&CC devised a “Mechanism for environmental management in critically/severely polluted areas (CPAs/SPAs) for consideration of projects listed as Red/Orange categories” Protocols to be followed by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) /Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) for improvement of environmental quality in the Critically/Severely Polluted Areas (CPAs/SPAs) are provided. Stringent emission and effluent discharge have to be stipulated for improvement of environmental quality. For consideration of new proposals and expansion activities list in red and orange category located in the CPAs/SPAs stringent conditions have been recommended. Any project or activity in Category ‘B1’ will be appraised at the Central Level, if located in whole or in part with in 5 km from the boundary of CPAs or SPAs. Proposals located in CPAs and SPAs may be examined by the sectoral Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) during scoping/appraisal based on the EPI scores of Air/Water/Land Environment published by CPCB from time to time. In such proposals, appropriate mitigation measures for environment possessing higher CEPI score shall be made by EAC in the form of recommendations/decision. These recommendations shall be explicitly mentioned in the Terms of Reference/Environmental Clearance letter and shall be ensured by the Member Secretary concerned.*****
