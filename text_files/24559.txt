ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b):    There is no mechanism to regulate the pricing of pesticides in the Insecticides Act, 1968 and Insecticides Rules, 1971. Pricing of pesticides is market driven and to make available pesticides at reasonable prices, the Registration Committee grants registration certificates for generic pesticides expeditiously. Availability of more options to farmers ensures healthy competition in the market thereby having the effect of stabilizing the prices.(c) and (d): Pesticides companies like any other companies are regulated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Further, the Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 to repeal and replace the existing Insecticides Act, 1968 has already been introduced in Rajya Sabha on 23rd March 2020.(e): 	Every country follows its own regulations in respect of quality control and manufacture of pesticides depending on its own requirements. Similarly, use of pesticides by different countries is also governed as per local traditions and requirements. In India, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is implementing the ''Sub-Mission on Plant Protection’ with a mandate to popularize adoption of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) through training and demonstration in crops. IPM is an environmentally friendly comprehensive ecological approach through which farmers are made aware about the minimum dependence on chemical pesticides, judicious use of chemical pesticides and use as per the prescriptions given in the label and leaflets. Government has established 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centers in 28 States and two Union Territories in the country which impart trainings to farmers and State Extension Officers through Farmers Field Schools (FFS), short and long duration training programmes on IPM strategies. During the trainings, major emphasis is given on judicious use of chemical pesticide as a last resort, safety in use of pesticides, alternate tools for pest management viz. cultural, physical, mechanical methods of pest control as well as use of bio-pesticides and bio-control agents, effects of pesticides on natural enemies of pests, do’s and don’ts for pesticides including proper application equipment and technique. ******
