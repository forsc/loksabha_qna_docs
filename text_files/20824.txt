The KV is presently functioning from class I to XII with an enrollment of 710 students out of which, 46 students are the wards of NTPC employees.

The NTPC authorities at Kayamkulam have conveyed that NTPC is ready to extend the infrastructural facilities to KVS till a permanent alternate arrangement is made.
