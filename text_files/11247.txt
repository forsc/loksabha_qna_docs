                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (f):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.  21   DUE FOR REPLY ON 4TH FEBRUARY, 2020.(a):	Till date financial benefits have been released to total 8,35,77,649 farmers. The number of beneficiaries of PM-KISAN including Punjab and Chhattisgarh are attached at Annexure-I. In the district of Rajnandgaon, financial benefits have been released to 1,67,043 beneficiaries out of the 1,92,996 registered farmer families under the Scheme. (b):	Under this Scheme, total amount of Rs. 50,029 crores has been released to the eligible farmers. The details of amount released to States and UTs is annexed at Annexure-I.(c): 	No, in fact, the number of beneficiaries is increasing with every period. The details are annexed at Annexure-II.(d):	The State-wise details of farmer families registered under PM-KISAN who have not been given any installment are given at Annexure-III. Also the number of farmer families who are yet to be paid in Rajnandgaon District of Chhattisgarh is 25,953. The reasons for non-payment of benefits to the eligible farmer families include mismatch of names in land records and Aadhaar Cards, failure in Account validation at the PFMS level due to reasons like wrong Account number, wrong IFSC etc. To release benefits to these farmer families, the data that needs to be corrected has been opened for correction to States/UTs. In addition, the facility of Aadhaar correction by the beneficiary has been provided on the PM-KISAN portal and for this purpose, Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized.(e):    The State specific issues in identification of beneficiaries in respect of North Eastern Region, Jharkhand, Chhattigarh etc. have been resolved. For enrollment, the farmers are required to approach the local patwari / revenue officer / Nodal Officer (PM-Kisan) nominated by the State Government. Further, the farmers can self-register themselves through Farmers Corner at PMKISAN Portal. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme. Contd…2/--2-(f): 	The Government has constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and to recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress as per these recommendations. Due to the efforts made as part of schemes/ programmes of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare which also aligns with the strategy of doubling farmers’ income, there has been an appreciable improvement in efficiency bringing about a positive impact in the agriculture sector. Various interventions and schemes that have already been rolled out are:(i)	Implementation of flagship scheme of distribution of Soil Health Cards to farmers so that the use of fertilizers can be rationalized. (ii)	“Per drop more crop” initiative under which drip/sprinkler irrigation is being encouraged for optimal utilization of water, reducing cost of inputs and increasing productivity.(iii)	“Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)” for promoting organic farming.(iv)	Launch of e-NAM initiative to provide farmers an electronic transparent and competitive online trading platform. (v)	With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, a crop insurance scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was launched from Kharif 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover for all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances, with low premium contribution by farmers.(vi)	Under “Har Medh Par Ped”, agro forestry is being promoted for additional income.  With the amendment of Indian Forest Act, 1927, Bamboo has been removed from the definition of trees. A restructured National Bamboo Mission has been launched in the year 2018 to promote bamboo plantation on non forest government as well as private land and emphasis on value addition, product development and  markets.Contd…3/--3-(vii)	Giving a major boost for the farmer’s income, the Government has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif & Rabi crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production.(viii)	Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives, the Government has approved a new Umbrella Scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata  Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)’.  The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018. This is an unprecedented step taken by Govt. of India to protect the farmers’ income which is expected to go a long way towards the welfare of farmers. (ix)	Bee keeping has been promoted under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) to increase the productivity of crops through pollination and increase the honey production as an additional source of income of farmers.(x)	Extending the reach of institutional credit to more and more farmers is priority area of the Government and to achieve this goal, the Government provides interest subvention of 2% on short-term crop loans up to Rs.3.00 lakh. Presently, loan is available to farmers at an interest rate of 7% per annum, which gets reduced to 4% on prompt repayment. (xi)	Government sets annual target for the flow of credit to the agriculture sector, Banks have been consistently surpassing the annual target. The current year’s agriculture credit flow target has been set at Rs. 13.50 lakh crore.(xii)	Further, under Interest Subvention Scheme 2018-19, in order to provide relief to the farmers on occurrence of natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% shall continue to be available to banks for the first year on the restructured amount. In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses against negotiable receipts, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months post harvest on the same rate as available to crop loan.(xiii)	The Government has approved for giving the facility of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to the farmers practicing animal husbandry and fisheries related   activities and has also decided to extend the Interest Subvention Facilities to such categories of farmers. Contd…4/--4-(xiv)	Further with a view to provide social security net for Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood, the Government has decided to implement another new Central Sector Scheme for providing old age pension to these farmers. Under this Scheme, a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the eligible small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion clauses, on attaining the age of 60 years.
