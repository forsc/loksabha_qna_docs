                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (c) :	Government of India announced privatisation of Power Departments & Utilities in Union Territories (UTs) under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. The decision is guided by sub-optimal performance of power distribution utilities and the objective of providing better services to consumers with improvement in operational and financial efficiencies. This will also provide a model for emulation by other Utilities across the country. The UT of Chandigarh has received bids.  The UTs of Dadra & Nagar Haveli (DNH) and Daman Diu (DD) have also received bids and bids have been evaluated. The UTs of A&N Islands, Puducherry and Lakshadweep are at RFP finalization Stage. J&K has commissioned a study to examine the modalities.************
