Railway has taken up Vijayawada-Gudivada-Bhimavaram-Narasapur, Gudivada-Machilipatnam and Bhimavaram-Nidadavolu (221 km) doubling project. Project is on cost sharing basis with Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, in which Govt. of Andhra Pradesh is sharing 50% cost of Project. Anticipated cost of the project is ?2500 crore. and an expenditure of ?1848 crore has been incurred on the project. The original budget allotment for 2019-20 was ?175 crore, which has been further increased to ?776 crore. The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project. As such, firm completion time of the projects cannot be fixed at this stage.…….2/--2-(c) and (d) An outlay of ?1158 crore has been proposed for financial year 2020-21 for this project. Work has been taken up on the project. Out of 221 km project length, 58 km (40 km long Moturu-Akividu section and 18 km long Akividu-Bhimavaram section) has been commissioned during 2019-20.Budget Allocation(for the project falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh):Average Annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh during 2014-19 has been increased to  2830 crore per year during 2014-2019 from ?886 crore per year during 2009-14 which is 219%  more than average annual allocation of  2009-14. Total allocation of Budget for Infrastructure projects & safety works falling fully/ partly in State of Andhra Pradesh, in 2019-20 is  3885 crore which is 338% more than the average annual allocation of 2009-14. Commissioning of projects:During 2009-14, 363 Km (81 Km of New line, 144 Km of Gauge Conversion and 138 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the state at an average rate 72.6 km per year.  In 2014-19, 377 Km (258 Km of New Line and 119 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the state at an average rate 75.3 Km per year.  Thus, the commissioning  during 2014-19 was 4% more than during 2009-14.For the above said project, an amount of around ?412 crore is outstanding towards State Government share. Also for all the cost sharing projects in Andhra Pradesh, around ?1411 crore is outstanding towards State Government share. The timely deposition of State Government share is essential for quick execution of projects. *****
