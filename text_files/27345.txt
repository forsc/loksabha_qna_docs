The coverage of the scheme has been extended to 718 districts upto 2019-20. The scheme was extended to 315 districts as part of Phase I (2017-18), in 267 districts as part of Phase II (2018-19), and in the remaining 136 districts as part of Phase III (2019-20). West Bengal has not yet started implementation of the POSHAN Abhiyaan. Under the Mission Poshan 2.0 announced in Budget 2021-22, an integrated nutrition support programme extends its coverage across all districts of States/UTs.(b)	To strengthen the implementation and operational preparedness under the said mission, more than 10 lakh Anganwadi Workers have been trained in various modules of the Incremental Learning Approach (ILA) component of the POSHAN Abhiyaan. Incremental Learning Approach (ILA) is a capacity building approach in which learning is broken down into small portions of doable actions. Government launched Poshan Tracker, an ICT based application in March 2021, which provides a 360-degree view of the activities of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC), service deliveries of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and complete beneficiary management for pregnant women, lactating mothers and children. In order to facilitate use of this digital application amongst Anganwadi Workers (AWW)/ Anganwadi Helpers (AWH),  Government has organised training of Anganwadi Workers/Anganwadi Helpers. Till date, more than 6.5 lakhs Anganwadi Workers/ Anganwadi Helpers have been trained by the Common Service Centre (CSC) to facilitate the use of Poshan tracker by the Frontline Functionaries of the Anganwadi Service. Further, Ministry has sent a communication dated 2nd February, 2021 to States/UTs regarding appointment of Nodal Person for providing technical support and resolving any issue regarding downloading the new Poshan Tracker application and its functioning.
