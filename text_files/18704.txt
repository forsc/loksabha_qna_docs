                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):        As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), there is no need to file the crop loss/ claims intimation in case of wide spread natural calamities such as drought, flood etc. as the claims are calculated on the basis of shortfall in yield at the end of season. The end season, prevented sowing and midseason adversity claims are settled on the basis of Area Approach and yield data/crop damage report provided by concerned State Government.  However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst, natural fire and post-harvest losses due to unseasonal rains/cyclone/hailstorms are calculated on individual insured farm basis.   Hence, farmers have to intimate the loss of their crops to the concerned insurance company/State Government/ financial institutions.  Crop losses are assessed by a joint committee comprising representatives of State Government and concerned insurance company. Details of total number of farmers benefitted (who got claims) under the scheme for the years 2017-18, 2028-19 and 2019-20 are at Annexure-I.Contd…2/--2-(b):        Year-wise details of claims reported and claims paid in Bihar under PMFBY are given in Annexure-II.(c) :     As per Agri-Census 2015-16, the total number of operational land holdings with operated area measuring five hectares or below is 1424.2 lakh.(d) & (e):     The PMFBY is available for all farmers and all States on voluntary basis.  Crops and areas for coverage under the scheme are notified by the concerned State Government.
