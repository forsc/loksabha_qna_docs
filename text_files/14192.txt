ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c) 	Yes, Sir. Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has taken necessary steps and adopted stricter norms for safety from Electromagnetic Field (EMF) emission from mobile towers. 	With regard to impact of EMF emissions from mobile towers on health, World Health Organization (WHO), has referred to approximately 25,000 articles published around the world over past 30 years, and based on an in-depth review of scientific literature, has concluded - “current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields”.	The main conclusion from the WHO review is that EMF exposure below the limits recommended in the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) international guidelines do not appear to have any known consequence on health.   	In India, norms for exposure limit for the Radio Frequency Field (Base Station Emissions) has been fixed 10 times more stringent than the safe limits prescribed by ICNIRP and recommended by WHO. The present emission norms as laid down for Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) installed at various mobile towers in India are as follows:<pre>Frequency Range	E-Field Strength   (Volt/Meter)	H-Field Strength (Amp/Meter)	Power Density (Watt/Sq.Meter)400 MHz  to 2000 MHz	0.434 f ½	0.0011 f ½	f / 20002 GHz to 300 GHz	19.29	0.05	1</pre>(f is frequency in MHz)	In 2014, a Committee, comprised of members from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee, Bombay and from other scientific institutions of the country including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Delhi, was setup at the behest of High Court Allahabad, Lucknow bench. The Committee, in its report, has noted, inter-alia, that “there are no conclusive evidence to establish any causal link between the effect of EMF radiation from BTS with biological effects described in cell models, animals or humans, and any possible resulting health effects.” **********
