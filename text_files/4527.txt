ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  The NITI Aayog in its Composite Water Management Index (CWMI) indicated that nearly 600 million people in India are facing acute water shortages by quoting the report of the World Resources Institute (WRI) which estimated that 54 percent of India’s total area, including parts of Maharashtra, are facing high to extremely high water stressed, thereby affecting nearly 600 million people.  (c) & (d)  A National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development was formulated in August 1980 by the erstwhile Ministry of Irrigation. The NPP comprises of two components, namely (i) Peninsular Rivers Development and (ii) Himalayan Rivers Development. The Plan identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR) of all the 30 links have been prepared and circulated to the concerned    State    Governments   by   the   NWDA.    After  survey  and  investigations,   the  Feasibility  Contd…P/2//2//Reports of 14 links under Peninsular Component and Feasibility Reports of 2 links and draft Feasibility Reports of 7 links under Himalayan Component have been completed.Four priority links under the Peninsular River Component have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) namely, Ken - Betwa link project (KBLP) Phase – I & II, Damanganga - Pinjal link project, Par – Tapi - Narmada link project and Godavari - Cauvery link project (consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/ Janampet) - Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila),        Pennar (Somasila) - Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects). The details of river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at  Annexure.(e)	The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing technical and financial assistance through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has been taking various steps to improve the water availability in the country. Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, by integrating two Ministries viz; Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate the management of water resources under one umbrella in a holistic manner. Recognising the importance of involvement at the grassroots level, the Hon’ble PM has personally addressed letters to all Sarpanches in the country motivating them to take up water conservation activities. Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign; officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management. Central Government has formulated National Water Policy (NWP), 2012 which inter-alia recommends conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures.The NWP, 2012 has been sent to all States/ Union Territories and the concerned Central Ministries for appropriate action. Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdfContd…P/3//2//The water supply component of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, includes water conservation, rejuvenation of water bodies and recharging of ground water. Rain water harvesting and other water conservation measures are incorporated in the guidelines for Urban Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) and Model Building Bye-Laws (MBBL) for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Urban Development Authorities (UDAs). Till date, 33 States/UTs out of 36 States/UTs have amended their Building Bye Laws (BBLs) or issued guidelines in this regard, in compliance with MBBL. To promote circular economy of water, National Urban Sanitation Policy 2008 mandates reuse of at least 20 percent of treated waste water. Dual piping system in certain types of buildings have been mandated under MBBL to promote usage of treated waste water for non-potable purposes, including toilet flushing, horticulture, agriculture, fire hydrants etc.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (c) & (d) of Unstarred Question No. 4139 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 18.07.2019 regarding “Water Stress”Present status of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
