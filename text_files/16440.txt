                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	 The Revised Integrated Housing Scheme (RIHS), 2007, was implemented for construction of house by the Beedi/ Iron Ore Mines, Manganese Ore Mines & Chrome Ore Mines (IOMC) and Limestone Ore Mines, Dolomite Ore Mines (LSDM) and Mica Ore Mines workers. Under this scheme, subsidy @ Rs.40,000/- was paid in two installments of Rs.20,000/- each for construction of a house on land measuring not Contd..2/-:: 2 ::less than 60 square yards. The plinth area of the house constructed should be around 160 square feet and the construction should be completed within a period of 18 months. The workers were required to submit FDR of Rs.5,000/- towards his contribution with the Welfare Commissioner, which was to be returned to them along with second installment of subsidy. Later it was revised in 2016. As per Revised Integrated Housing Scheme (RIHS) 2016, subsidy of Rs.1,50,000/- (per beneficiary) was provided in three (3) installments in the ratio of 25:60:15 (Rs.37,500, Rs.90,000 and Rs.22,500) to Beedi/Iron Ore Mines, Manganese Ore & Chrome Ore Mines (IOMC)/Limestone Mines, Dolomite Mines (LSDM)/Mica Mines and Cine Workers for construction of  own pucca houses.A meeting of Expenditure Finance Committee for appraisal and continuation of the “Labour Welfare Scheme” was held on 11.05.2018 under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Expenditure), where it was decided  that the Ministry of Labour & Employment will explore the possibilities to converge the Housing Scheme with the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (PMAY) of the Ministry of Urban Development(Urban)  and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (Grameen) of the Ministry of Rural Development. It was suggested by the committee to frame a timeline and to draw a transition plan when all new sanctions under RIHS will be stopped and housing subsidy will be drawn from PMAY. Accordingly all Welfare Commissioners were directed to send all the pending applications to the concerned Blocks/ULBs for sanction under PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna). No new applications  are being accepted under RIHS, 2016 any more.(b):		 The scheme is implemented across the country.(c):		 Placed at Annexure-I. (d):		 Placed at Annexure-II. (e):		 The Revised Integrated Housing Scheme has been converged with Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (PMAY). The eligible beedi workers can take the benefit of PMAY.**                                         ******
