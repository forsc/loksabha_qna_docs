The MCAs include 870 Minority Concentration Blocks, 321 Minority Concentration Towns and 109 Minority Concentration Districts Headquarters.  Thrust of the PMJVK is to allocate at least 80% of the resources in education, health and skill development sectors of which at least 33-40% to be allocated for women centric projects.  Construction of Hunar Hubs is one of the projects considered under the scheme with the objective of enablingartisans/entrepreneurs to carry out exhibitions/melas/food-courts/skill training under one roof in the identified MCD Hqrs.
