MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (D) OF LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 304 FOR REPLY ON 16.03.2020 ASKED BY HON’BLEMP DR. RAMAPATI RAM TRIPATHI REGARDING OPENING OF NEWSCHOOLS(a) to (d): As per the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education(RTE) Act, 2009 it is the duty of the respective State and Union Territory Government whichis the appropriate Government under the RTE Act to provide free and compulsory elementaryeducation to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighbourhood school. In pursuance ofSection 6 of the RTE Act, the respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government havenotified areas or limits of their neighbourhood norms in their State RTE Rules, factoring intheir State specific condition, for opening of schools.The Central Government, through integrated centrally sponsored scheme of SamagraShiksha provides support to the States and UTs for implementing the various provisions ofthe RTE Act, including opening/ strengthening of schools. Under erstwhile Sarva ShikshaAbhiyan (SSA), till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, sanction has beengiven for 3.64 lakh new elementary schools out of which States and UTs have reported theopening of 3.60 lakh schools. Under erstwhile Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan(RMSA), till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, 12994 new secondaryschools have been sanctioned, out of which States and UTs have reported opening of 12423new schools, till 31.12.2019.Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas are considered only whenreceived in the prescribed proforma from the District Administration through the StateGovernment concerned. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities foropening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas also have to compete among other proposals under the“Challenge Method”. There are 1227 Kendriya Vidyalayas (and three abroad) functioning inthe country.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality education tochildren predominantly from the rural areas. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the availability of suitable land by the concerned State Government free ofcost for construction of school buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free ofrent) to start the Vidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on theavailability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. There are 645 functionalJawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) in the country.****
