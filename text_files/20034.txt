                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) to (f) : Under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, E-Commerce Rules, 2020 have been notified by Central Government for prevention of unfair trade practice in e-commerce and protection of the interest and rights of the consumers. The E-Commerce Rules, 2020 specify duties and liabilities of the e-commerce entities (market place & inventory model) and sellers on e-marketplaces.  As per these Rules, every e-commerce entity is required to provide information relating to return, refund, exchange, warranty and guarantee, delivery and shipment, modes of payment, grievance redressal mechanism, payment methods, security of payment methods, charge-back options, etc. The rules further provide that E-commerce entities shall establish an adequate grievance redressal mechanism and shall appoint a grievance officer for consumer grievance redressal, and shall display the name, contact details, and designation of such officer on its platform.  The grievance officer is required to acknowledge receipt of any consumer complaint within forty-eight hours and redress the complaint within one month from the date of receipt of the complaint.          	The Central Government already runs a National Consumer Helpline with a toll free number 1800-11-4000 (short code 14404) to attend to consumer grievances, which serves as a pre-litigation alternate dispute resolution mechanism. Of the total grievances received in 2020, 28.5% of the complaints relate to e-commerce sector.*****
