                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA):a.	National Education Society for Tribal Students (NESTS) (an autonomous body under this Ministry) has taken several steps to foster quality education in Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) and facilitate students to excel in academics, sports, and extra-curricular activities. With an objective of enhancing the professional skills and competencies of EMRS Principals and teachers  in different fields like assessments, learning outcomes, pedagogy of Teaching-Learning etc,  ministry has  collaborated with NCERT for conduct of NISHTHA (National Initiative of School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement), training program. The main objectives of the programme include the following: •	To build the capacity of Principals and teachers in EMRS on emerging and contextual issues concerning quality education. •	To equip all elementary stage teachers and Principals from EMRS with skills to transact their subject areas in a conducive and activity based environment in which children learn doing experiments, discussion, analysis, etc. rather than through rote memorization. •	To orient teachers and Principals with pedagogical practices used in elementary classrooms as prescribed by the New Education Policy, 2020 such as experiential learning including toy-based pedagogy, art integrated learning etc. •	To enable EMRS to make a pool of key resource persons out of those teachers and principals who shall receive NISHTHA elementary stage training.                 The first batch of NISHTHA Capacity Building program for EMRS Principals and Teachers was conducted from 10th May, 2021 to 23rd June, 2021 (utilizing Summer Vacation). The integrated program has been successfully completed.b.     Following dedicated efforts have been taken for opening maximum number of EMRSs in tribal areas of the country including Gujarat:i.	Establishment of National Education Society for Tribal Students (NESTS) at central and state EMRS Society at State Level for providing all support to EMRSs towards setting up and imparting quality education to the tribal children. ii.	Regular follow up with state for identification of suitable land with support of district level officials for construction of EMRS.iii.	Follow up with state society for functioning of sanctioned EMRSs in temporary building till the construction work is over.iv.	Construction of EMRSs has been assigned by NESTS to Central/State PSUs to prevent delay in construction works after finalizing of suitable land by State Government. *****
