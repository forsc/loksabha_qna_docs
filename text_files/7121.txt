STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF STARRED QUESTION     NO.*74 TO BE ANSWERED ON 21.11.2019 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS” RAISED BY SHRI RAMDAS C. TADAS & SHRI SANGAM LAL GUPTA. M.Ps.(a) to (c)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Under NPP, three inter-linking of rivers (ILR) projects namely, Krishna (Almatti)-Pennar link project, Bedti-Varda link project and Netravati-Hemavati link project have been identified benefitting Karnataka State.Three ILR projects namely, Yamuna- Rajasthan link project, Rajasthan-Sabarmati link project and Parbati–Kalishindh – Chambal link project have been identified benefitting Rajasthan State.Two ILR projects namely, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been identified benefitting Maharashtra State.Six ILR projects namely, Ken-Betwa link project, Gandak - Ganga link project, Ghaghra (Karnali)-Yamuna link project, Sarda-Yamuna link project, Chunar-Sone Barrage link project and Kosi-Ghaghra (Karnali) link project have been identified benefitting Uttar Pradesh State.The details of the above ILR projects indicating their status is given at Annexure-I.Apart from the above, NWDA has received proposals of 6 intra-State link projects from Government of Karnataka, 20 intra-State link projects from Government of Maharashtra and 2 intra-State link projects from Government of Rajasthan.The details of the above intra-State link projects indicating their status is given at Annexure-II.(d)  The implementation of river link projects involves various steps such as preparation of Pre Feasibility Reports/ Feasibility Reports of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the projects, clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood control & multipurpose projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti, investment clearance. The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained. The main problems involving implementation of the ILR projects include problem in consensus among party States, funding for implementation, implementation mechanism and international issues (projects involving other countries).*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *74 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 21.11.2019 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, name of rivers, status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
