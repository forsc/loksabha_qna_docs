ANSWER




  MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')  (a) to (e)  The setting up of Universities is an ongoing process. Recently two Central Universities have been established in Andhra Pradesh and one Central Tribal University is proposed in Telangana under Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act 2014. West Bengal state has a Central University Vishwa Bharti at Shantiniketan. At present there is no proposal to open new Central Universities in West Bengal. As per the 12 th Plan (2012-17), as approved by the National Development Council, the thrust was on consolidation of the higher education system. Expansion was to be mainly done by scaling up capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. *****
