JITENDRA SINGH)(a):  The group-wise and department-wise details of sanctioned posts and number in position, as on 1-3-2014, 1-3-2015, 1-3-2016 and 1-3-2018, are at Annexure-I,II, III & IV, respectively.(b): The number of candidates recommended for appointment by the Union Public Service Commission(UPSC), Staff Selection Commission(SSC) and Ministry of Railways, during the last five years  is at Annexure –V.(c) & (d): Recruitment against vacant posts is a continuous process. By the time the vacancies reported by a Department get filled up, some new vacancies may arise. Where a post remains vacant for more than two years to three years (newly created post), the same becomes ‘deemed abolished’ as per Department of Expenditure OM No. 7(1)/E-Coord-I/2007 dated 12.04.2017. Such posts are revived based on their functional justification.Recently, all Ministries/Departments of Government of India have been requested to take necessary action for filling up of the existing vacancies in respective Ministries/Departments, their attached and subordinate offices, in a time bound manner.*****
