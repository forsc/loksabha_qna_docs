RBI has informed that it is closely monitoring the liquidity position of the NBFCs and will continue to monitor the activity and performance of the NBFC sector with a focus on major entities and their inter-linkages with other sectors. RBI has further informed that with a view to strengthen the NBFCs and maintain stability of the financial system, RBI has been taking necessary regulatory and supervisory steps.As per RBI inputs, a number of measures have been taken to improve the liquidity for NBFCs including, inter alia, the following: (i)	Open market operations were conducted, in addition to regular Liquidity Adjustment Facility auctions, to inject liquidity in financial markets.(ii)	RBI permitted special dispensation to banks up until 31st March 2019, whereby their incremental credit to NBFCs and HFCs after October 19, 2018, could be treated as high quality liquid assets for calculation of Liquidity Coverage Ratios. (iii)	The single-borrower exposure limit for NBFCs that do not finance infrastructure was increased from 10 percent to 15 percent of capital funds, up to 31st March 2019.(iv)	Banks were permitted to provide partial credit enhancement for non-deposit accepting systematically-important NBFCs registered with RBI and HFCs registered with NHB as per guidelines.   (v)	RBI reduced the minimum average maturity requirement for External Commercial Borrowings in the infrastructure space raised by eligible borrowers from five years to three years.  (vi)	To encourage NBFCs to securitise/assign their eligible assets, the Minimum Holding Period requirement for originating NBFCs was relaxed till December 2019.(vii)	NBFCs were provided regulatory concessions to enable restructuring of MSME loans.(viii)	NBFCs with assets over Rs. 5,000 crore have been asked to appoint a Chief Risk Officer to improve the standards of risk management.Government has received a proposal from RBI to strengthen RBI’s regulatory and supervisory powers under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, and the same is under consideration. Government, from time to time, infuses capital in public sector NBFCs based on an objective assessment of requirements. There is no proposal under consideration of the Government to recapitalise private NBFCs.***
