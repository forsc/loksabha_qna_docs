                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)	& (b) Air pollution has emerged as a serious environmental concern in the country. The ambient air quality data for metropolitan cities / million plus urban agglomerations during 2016- 2018 is given in Annexure-I. Analysis of data revealed that SO2 levels were within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in all 50 cities during 2016-18. With respect to NO2, 17 cities showed an increasing trend, 16 cities showed a decreasing concentration, 16 cities showed a fluctuating trend and 1 city revealed steady concentration. With respect to PM2.5, trends are available for 17 cities and out of which, 08 cities showed an increasing trend, 04 cities showed a decreasing concentration, 05 cities showed a fluctuating trend. With respect to PM10, 14 cities showed an increasing trend, 14 cities showed a decreasing concentration, 22 cities showed a fluctuating trend.  (c) & (d) The Central Government has issued notification regarding ‘Mandatory Implementation of Dust Mitigation Measures for Construction and Demolition Activities for projects requiring Environmental Clearance (EC)’ and ‘Mandatory Implementation of Dust Mitigation Measures for all Construction and Demolition Activities’ in January, 2018. Central Pollution Control Board has also issue guidelines on dust mitigation measures in handling construction material and construction and demolition waste.  Regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies have to ensure the compliance of dust mitigation measures related to the construction activities. They are empowered to issue show cause, levy fines and even direct stopping of work in case of violations.  Under Graded Response Action Plan, the Task Force constituted for implementation of various graded measures may decide for ban on construction based on Air Quality Index being in severe+ category.With regard to phasing out of old vehicles from plying on roads to reduce effects of pollution, Hon’ble Supreme Court has directed that 10-year-old diesel vehicles and all 15-year-old petrol vehicles shall not ply in Delhi and NCR.
