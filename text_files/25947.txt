                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH   PATEL)(a) & (b) To make provision for potable tap water supply to every rural home by 2024, Government of India is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with States, with an estimated outlay of 3.60 lakh Crore. The erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) has been subsumed under the Jal Jeevan Mission. Powers to plan, approve and implement water supply schemes including those under NRDWP, are vested with States. Under Jal Jeevan Mission, provision have been made to expedite the implementation of water supply schemes taken up under erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) in a time-bound manner. To make all such ongoing schemes JJM compliant i.e. water supply at the rate of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) and to provide every household with tap water connection, provision is there under JJM to augment and retrofit by utilizing JJM funds.  As on 15th August, 2019, at the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, in Rajasthan, out of 101.32 lakh rural households, 11.74 lakh households (11.59%) had piped water connections. Since then, 8.75 lakh households (8.64%) have been provided tap water connections, thus increasing the tap water supply to 20.50 lakh households (20.23%). Remaining 80.83 lakhs rural households are planned to be provided with tap water connection by 2024.*****
