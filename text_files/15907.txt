ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(c): There are two steel manufacturing Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) in India namely, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL).	The Government reviews and evaluates Steel CPSEs on the basis of their own performance on various parameters in the MoUs as entered into by them with the Ministry of Steel.	Most of the integrated steel plants in the Public Sector under Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) were set up in 1960s and 1970s except Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) which was set up in 1990s. Some of the technologies and equipments adopted therein have since become old and obsolete. Both the steel CPSEs have undertaken modernization/expansion programmes to, inter-alia, address the problems of technological obsolescence.********
