                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): The Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway wise and not State wise as the Indian Railways’ network spans across various State boundaries.  However, as on 01.04.2020, total 07 New lines projects of total length 570 km costing ?8,145 crore falling fully/partly in Haryana are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which, commissioning of 81 km has been achieved and an expenditure of ?1,473 crore has been incurred upto March, 2020.  The details  of all ongoing projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in> Ministry of Railways> Railway Board> about Indian Railways> Railway Board Directorates> Finance (Budget)> Rail Budget/Pink Book (year)> Railway-wise Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme (RSP).New line projects are sanctioned end to end and en-route stations are decided based on traffic projection and in consultation with State Government.  Presently, physical work has been taken up on Rohtak-Meham-Hansi (64 Km.) New Rail line and work on Rewari-Rohtak (81.26 Km) including new material modification for shifting of Rohtak-Gohana-Panipat through bypass line including elevated track at Gohana has been completed recently.(c) & (d): The Bhiwani-Loharu New Railway line project (58 km) and Delhi-Sohna-Nuh-Ferozpur-Jhirka-Alwar New Railway line project (104 km) has been identified for development by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (HRIDC) a Joint Venture Company of Ministry of Railways (49%) and Government of Haryana (51%).  Feasibility Study and financial analysis is under approval with State Government.(e): Completion of any Railway project/s depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of State cost share by concerned State government in cost sharing projects,  shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearance from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project/s site, number of working months in a year for particular project site, etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project/s.  As such confirmed time frame for completion of project/s cannot be ascertained at this stage.Average Annual Budget allocation for infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Haryana during 2014-19, has increased to ?968 crore per year from ?315 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 207% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. Budget outlay of ?1,201 crore has been provided for financial year 2021-22 which is 281% more than the average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  *****
