ANSWER




                                                                     THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                     (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a): As per Census 2011, the percentage of population living in slums out of total population of the country is 5.41%. (b) to (f): Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/UT Governments to implement schemes to provide houses to the eligible urban families/beneficiaries including slum dwellers. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) does not have any specific policy for rehabilitation in respect of slums adjacent to Railway tracks. However, in pursuance of the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All’, MoHUA through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) is giving Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers since 25.06.2015.                                               *****
