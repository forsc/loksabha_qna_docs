ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) The National Water Policy 2012 emphasizes promotion of research and advancement in technology to address issues in the water sector in a scientific manner. Further, irrigation and water management are identified as priority areas for research to be undertaken under the scheme of the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR,RD&GR) titled “Research and Development Programme in Water Sector and Implementation of National Water Mission”.  The Central water Commission (CWC) had conducted Water Use Efficiency (WUE) studies various major and medium irrigation projects during 10th & 11th Five Year Plans.  These studies have suggested various corrective interventions to improve the water use efficiency of the projects to achieve better water management. National Water Mission has also awarded baseline studies to various institutions for evaluating water use efficiency of the various operational major/medium irrigation projects. (c) & (d) Micro-irrigation related activities are implemented by DoWR,RD&GR under its Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) program.  The program has been brought under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) from 2015-16 onwards, with funding being provided to the 99 prioritized Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) projects. Under the programme, it is mandatory to develop 10% of the balance Cultivable Command Area (CCA) using micro irrigation (drip/sprinkler). The installation of drip/sprinkler set at farm level are arranged by farmers themselves or through financial assistance which can obtained under the “Per Drop More Crop” component of PMKSY being implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (DoA&FW) operational from 2015-16 in the country.  ‘Sahi Fasal’ campaign was launched by National Water Mission in November 2019 to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which are not water intensive, but use water very efficiently, and are economically remunerative, are healthy and nutritious; suited to the agro-climatic-hydro characteristics of the area, and are environmentally friendly. Creating awareness among farmers on appropriate crops, micro-irrigation, soil moisture conservation etc, weaning them away from water intensive crops like paddy, sugarcane etc. to crops like corn, maize etc which require less water, assisting policy makers to frame policies that make effective pricing of inputs (water and electricity), improve procurement and market for these alternate crops, create appropriate storage them etc ultimately leading to increase in the income of farmers are the key elements of “Sahi Fasal”*****
