Appropriate action is taken against TV channels in case violation of the aforesaid Programme & Advertising Codes, including obscene content, is established.  Action against TV channels may extend from issue of warnings or advisories to comply with the Programme/Advertising Codes or directing channels to run apology scrolls on their channels and can extend up to taking the channels off air temporarily for varying period depending on the gravity of the violation.States have set-up District level and State level Monitoring Committees to monitor content telecast on cable TV channels.Further, as part of the self-regulation mechanism, Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) has set-up Broadcasting Content Complaint Council (BCCC) for  self-regulation in case of non-newschannels whereas News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) had been set-up by News Broadcasters Association (NBA) for monitoring content of news channels.  Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self-regulatory body of advertisement industry, looks into all advertisement related complaints across media such as Print, TV, Radio, Hoardings, SMS, Internet/web-site, etc.*********
