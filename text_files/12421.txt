SEBI had once again issued Press Advertisements on March 26, 2018 and June 19, 2018 informing the investors that July 2, 2018 (cut-off date) is the last date for receiving applications for refund and that no application would be accepted/ entertained after the cut-off date and that this would be the last and final opportunity for investors to claim refund.
