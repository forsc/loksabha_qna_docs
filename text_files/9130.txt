ANSWER




                                                           THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	The number of complaints registered against fraud agencies with the Ministry of External Affairs indicate that such complaints have increased in recent years. The figure of such complaints received in the Ministry during the period of 2016 to October 2019 is as under:<pre>Year No. of Complaints receivedCases referred to State Governments for actionProsecution Sanction sought by State GovernmentsProsecution Sanction issued by Ministry of External Affairs2016231231424220174464463030201835035015152019#6106103434# (up to 31st October, 2019)</pre>(b)	According to Section 10 of emigration Act, 1983, no person can function as Recruiting agent without a valid certificate for licence. Therefore, any agent indulging in recruitment of any type for overseas employment, without a proper registration certificate from Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), is an illegal agent. Whenever complaint against any person or an agent indulging in recruitment who is not registered, is received, immediate cognizance of the same is taken by the Ministry. The complaints are sent to the concerned law enforcement authorities for taking further action under the relevant laws.Complaints can also be lodged directly with the concerned law enforcement agencies by the affected persons, their relatives or any one from the public. Through its various awareness programmes, the Government encourages emigration only through safe and legal means.  The various authorities and public are encouraged to make enquiries about any agent offering services for emigration. If such agents are found to be illegal, people are further encouraged to make complaints to the concerned authorities.  (c) 	According to information given by the Indian Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in the months of July and August this year, a prominent member of the Indian Community there was contacted for help by some Indian nationals who had been recruited by a Chinese company for working in the mines in the eastern region of the country. These workers wanted to return to India. The Mission provided all assistance, including issuance of emergency certificates, which enabled all of them to return to India. The number of people who sought assistance from the Embassy were 42, which included 6 persons from Srikakulam. (d) & (e)	The terms for usage of Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) which has been created to help Indian nationals in distress, including those undergoing physical and mental abuse, have been further liberalised since September, 2017. The revised guidelines ‘inter alia’ cover the following: (i)	Boarding and lodging for deserving distressed Indian nationals abroad on a means tested basis in budget category hold or shelters run by Mission/Post or NGOs empanelled with Mission.(ii)	Air passage to India to stranded Overseas Indian nationals (iii) 	Legal Assistance on a means tested basis to deserving overseas Indian nationals who have committed minor crimes, offences or have been falsely implicated by their employer and put in jails; fishermen/seamen/sailors/Indian students in distress;  (iv) 	Legal / financial assistance to Indian women abandoned/cheated/abused by their NRI/PIO or foreign spouses (up to seven years after their marriage). (v)	Payment for small fines and penalties in respect of Indian nationals for minor offences/crimes; for illegal stay in the host country where prima facie the worker is not at fault, and to enable release of Indian nationals from jail/detention centre.(vi)  Transportation of Mortal Remains and expenditure on incidentals of deceased Indian national to India or local cremation/burial of deceased in such cases where the employer, sponsor or insurance company is unable or unwilling to do so as per the contract and the family is unable to meet the cost.(vii)	Emergency Medical Care on means tested basis to overseas Indians who are involved in an accident (with serious life threatening injuries) have life-threatening medical conditions or suffer a serious disability. ***
