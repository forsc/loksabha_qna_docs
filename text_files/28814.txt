                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) to (d):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life of citizens, including investigation and prosecution of crime against children, rests with respective State Governments, who are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.--2--LS.US.Q.NO. 347 FOR 30.11.2021	Preventing and combating the crime of human trafficking and crime against children is a continuous and evolving process, which involves various facets of technology and other efforts on the part of various stakeholders. A specific proposal on DNA survey is not under consideration of the Ministry of Home Affairs.	However, the Government of India has been supplementing the efforts of State Governments by providing them financial assistance to establish and strengthen the infrastructure for preventing and combating the crime of trafficking and by providing them guidance and advice through various advisories and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued from time to time. ******
