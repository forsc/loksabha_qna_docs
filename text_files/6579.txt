ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)&(b):	Food Corporation of India (FCI) only implements the food security programme of Government of India (GoI) and does not transact any commercial operations. In these operations, FCI procures foodgrain at Minimum Support Price (MSP) and sells at a  Central Issue Price (CIP) both of which are fixed by GoI. CIP is usually much lower than MSP.  The difference between total cost of procurement (MSP  and other incidentals) of  food grain   and CIP is provided by GoI as food subsidy to FCI. FCI receives revenue from the sale of food grain to States /UTs at CIP and the difference amount is received from GoI as food subsidy. However, since the above does not cover the cost of procurement etc, the FCI meets its debt obligations through Cash Credit Limit (CCL), Ways & Means Advances (WMA), Short Term Loan (STL), National Small Saving Fund (NSSF) Loan & bonds.............2/--2-(c)&(d):	The Department of Food & Public Distribution on behalf of FCI makes request for funds in the budget to the Ministry of Finance to meet the increased cost due to MSP plus incidentals. (e):	Debt of FCI as on March 2014 and  March 2019 are as under:-March 2014 = Rs.84,446 croreMarch 2019 = Rs.2,53,162 croreThe increase in debt of FCI is mainly due to increase in arrear subsidy due from Rs.45,633 crore in March, 2014 to Rs.1,90,922 crore in March, 2019 and increase in year-end stock held by FCI from Rs.51,487 crore in  March, 2014 to Rs.82,352 crore in March, 2019. Increase in stock value is caused by increase in quantity of stock due to open ended procurement policy.****
