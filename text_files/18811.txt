                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a):	Surplus production of some agricultural and horticultural crops, low level of processing and  lack of adequate post harvest infrastructure offer opportunities in development of food processing sector in the country. As per a Study “Assessment of Quantitative Harvest and Post-Harvest Losses of Major Crops and Commodities in India” carried out by Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana in 2015 for the crop year 2012-13, the estimated annual value of harvest and post-harvest losses of major agricultural produces at national level was Rs 92,651 Crores. The study was based on production data of 2012-13 and wholesale prices of 2014. The Inter-ministerial Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income, chaired by Dr. Ashok Dalwai, has recommended that Processing facilities, both small and large scale, can help the farmers in realizing better value on the surpluses. The Task Force on Losses incurred for perishable Agriculture/ Horticulture produce due to shortage of Cold Chain Capacity, constituted in 2014 under chairmanship of the Secretary, Food Processing Industries, recommended various schematic and policy interventions for ensuring adequate cold chain infrastructure in the country. Vision, Strategy and Action Plan for Food Processing Industries prepared by Rabo India Finance Pvt. Ltd in 2005 also concluded that rapid growth of food processing in the country is necessary & inevitable.(b): 	No major challenge is being faced in developing food processing industries in rural and backward areas of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. The Ministry has approved a total of 79, 149 & 50 number of projects respectively in these states under various component schemes of PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY). However there are challenges in some areas like availability of processable variety of raw materials, availability of land, availability of skilled manpower, bank credit, etc.(c):   	The Budget allocation and expenditure details of component scheme of Human Resource & Institutions- Skill Development under PMKSY is at Annexure-I. Under the scheme, MoFPI has approved a total of 30 projects –(a) 29 projects relate to creation of infrastructure Skill Training Centers, out of which 4 projects have been completed (b) 1 project relates to development/ translation of course curriculum for 13 Food Processing Job Roles.(d) & (e): The details of projects approved in the States of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for setting up of food processing units under the scheme of Creation/ Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities is at Annexure-II*****
