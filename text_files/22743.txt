ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal since August, 2019 after restructuring and subsuming erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Supply (NRDWP) to provide potable tap water in adequate quantity of prescribed quality on regular and long-term basis to every rural household through tap water connection, by 2024.Details of State-wise Central allocation in 2017-18 & 2018-19 under erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) and in 2019-20 under JJM are annexed.(b)	Under the JJM, district-wise allocation of fund is made by the respective States and not maintained at the Govt. of India level. However, the district and village wise status of physical achievements made across the country, including Ajmer district of Rajasthan, Satara and Solapur districts of Maharashtra, is in public domain and available on JJM dashboard at:https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx.(c) & (d) Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to households, priority is given to quality–affected habitations. Further, at the time of fund allocation to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Fluoride, nitrate and salinity. In 2020-21, Central allocation to Rajasthan has been increased to Rs 2,522.03Crore from Rs. 1,301.71 Crore in 2019-20. However, the State has drawn only Rs. 630.51 Crore (25%) so far. Similarly, in 2020-21, central allocation for Maharashtra has been increased to Rs 1,828.92Crore from Rs. 847.97 Crore in 2019-20 and the State has drawn only Rs. 457.23 Crore (25%).In March 2017, to provide potable drinking water to identified 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride-affected habitations in the country, National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched, which has now been subsumed under JJM. For identified6,849 Fluoride-affected habitations in Rajasthan Rs. 1,145.50 Crore and for 100 Fluoride-affected habitations in Maharashtra, an amount of Rs. 18.79 Crore has been released.As planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source takes time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.*****
