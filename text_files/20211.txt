(a) & (b):  Yes, Sir.  The 122 Infantry Battalion (TA) MADRAS has to be shifted from Kannur to their designated location i.e. Kozhikode (Calicut) by 25th March, 2021. The permanent location of 122 Infantry Battalion (TA) is at Kozhikode and there is a need to occupy the permanent location, due to operational reasons. Further, additional space is required at Kannur for expansion of Defence Security Corps (DSC) Centre.(c) & (d):  Canteen is not shut down. It is with the battalion in the deployed area as the battalion has been embodied for the operation task due to present situation. (e)  Petitions received from Ex-servicemen of the area have been suitably replied to.  There are other URCs managed by Headquarters Karnataka & Kerala Sub Area and Station Headquarter Kannur to meet the needs of ex-servicemen of the area.	TA Battalion move to Kozhikode will be better for ex-servicemen and benefit the civil population.  Presently, all military establishment are concentrated at Kannur.  Hence, relocation of Canteen Store Department of 122 TA Battalion will benefit Ex-servicemen residing near Kozhikode whereas the Unit Run Canteen of Defence Security Corps Centre will continue to provide support to Ex-servicemen of Kannur and nearby areas.  In addition, there is Indian Naval Academy, Ezhimala which also provides support to the Ex-servicemen and the local population.*****
