                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):      Details of total premium collected  by the insurance companies, claims paid and claims pending during last three years i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 in Gujarat under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are given in following table :											           (Rs. in crore)Year	Premium collected	Claims Reported	Claims Paid	Claims Pending2017-18	3014.27	1076.36	1075.45	0.932018-19	3141.39	2778.39	2777.77	0.622019-20*	3614.98	317.73	111.65	206.08        * Claims not fully reported.	As per provisions of the scheme, admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. However, settlement of claims in some States including Gujarat got delayed and average time take for settlement of claims increased due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data; late release of their share in premium subsidy, yield related disputes between insurance companies and State, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) related issues, etc. However, this Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims. Penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the scheme. *******
