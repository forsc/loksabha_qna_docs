ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) As on date there are 1224 KVs and 637 JNVs functioning in the countryproviding good quality education to over 13 lakhs students and 2.73 lakhs studentsrespectively. While Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are opened primarily to cater to theeducational needs of the children of transferable Central Government Employeesincluding Defence & Para-Military personnel by providing a common programme ofeducation, the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are established with theobjective of providing good quality modern education to children predominantly fromthe rural areas without regard to their family’s socio-economic condition.(b) State/UT-wise details of the KVs and JNVs functioning in the country areannexed.(c) & (d) Opening of KVs is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVsare considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government ofIndia/State Governments / Union Territories Administrations thereby committingresources for setting up a new KV as well as the availability of necessary sanction ofthe Government. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities foropening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the“Challenge Method”.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned StateGovernment to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofschool buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free of rent) to start theVidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on theavailability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. One JNV each hasbeen sanctioned in all the districts of the country as on 31st May 2014, excludingTamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.(e) No such proposal is under consideration at present.(f) Does not arise.******
