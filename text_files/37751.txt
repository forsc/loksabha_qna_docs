(b)        With respect to honorarium of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs), Government of India w.e.f. 01.10.2018 has enhanced the honorarium of AWWs at main-AWCs from ?3,000/- to? 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from ?2,250/- to ?3,500/- per month; AWHs from ?1,500/- to ?2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of ?250/- per month to AWHs.  Further, modified guidelines have been issued for performance linked incentive @ ? 500/- per month to Anganwadi Workers w.e.f. 01.04.2021. In addition, States/UTs are also paying additional monetary incentives/honorarium to these functionaries from their own resources.(c) State/UT-wise number of AWCs having pucca buildings, tapped water supply and toilets is at Annexure-II.(d) The Government of India allocates food-grains i.e. Wheat/Fortified Rice/Millets to State Governments/UT Administrations at subsidized rates under NFSA for preparation of supplementary food under Anganwadi Services.

Under this, State Governments/UT Administrations shall ensure that the quality of Supplementary Nutrition being provided is with reference to the norms of food safety as well as nutrient composition. Supplementary Nutrition must conform to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made there-under to ensure consistent quality and nutritive value per serving. Take-Home Ration (not raw ration), shall be tested from FSSAI owned/registered/empanelled/NABL accredited laboratory. Random testing must be conducted by Anganwadi Services functionaries after receipt of stock at the AWC or at the Block level. Anganwadi Services functionaries i.e. CDPO or Supervisor shall draw the samples, as per the prescribed procedure and send the sample for testing to a FSSAI owned/registered/empanelled/NABL accredited laboratory.ln case of Hot Cooked Meal, it should be ensured that it is prepared in proper kitchen sheds having adequate sanitation and safe drinking water so as to maintain hygienic conditions.State/UT wise allocation of foodgrains for the FY 2021-22 is at Annexure-III.*****  ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.425 for answer on 01.04.2022 regarding “Facilities at Anganwadi Centres” indicating State/UT-wise number of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) and children enrolled in these centres as on 30.06.2021 S.
