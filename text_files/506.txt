                                                    (a)	whether the Government has any plan to provide mini hospital facilities under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) and if so, the details thereof;(b)	whether the Government is likely to provide special funds for mini hospital facilities under the said Yojana and if so, the details thereof; and(c)	if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	An Adarsh Gram evolves out of people’s shared vision, using their capacities and available resources to the best extent possible, duly facilitated by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, the Gram Panchayat, civil society and the government machinery. The elements of an Adarsh Gram are context specific. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds. Hence, there is no proposal to provide special funds for mini hospital facilities under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana as of now.*****
