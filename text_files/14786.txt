                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b): Enforcement Directorate has reported that no fugitive economic offender (as defined in the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018) has left India in the year 2018-19. However, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has informed that 08 absconders/proclaimed offenders in 08 cases registered by CBI have reportedly left India during 2018-19. Another accused (yet to be declared absconder) has also fled from the country during the said period. The information in respect of the money liquidated through salvation of Fugitive Economic Offenders, Indian, Foreign and Benami Property is not readily available with the CBI.(c) & (d): Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, 2018 has been enacted which inter-alia, provides for expeditious confiscation of proceeds of crime and properties or benami property owned by the fugitive economic offender in India or abroad with a view to make him submit to the jurisdiction of Courts in India. The FEO Act is aimed at ensuring that persons accused of high value economic offences do not continue to evade the legal process of India by remaining abroad.The Income Tax Department (ITD) takes appropriate actions on a continuous basis, in case of various persons, including economic offenders, who are found to be involved in violation of the provisions of various Acts administered by the ITD, like the Income Tax Act, 1961, Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 etc. Such actions include searches & seizure, surveys, enquiries, filing of prosecution complaints in criminal courts, provisional attachment & confiscation of benami property etc. as per the provisions of the applicable Act.Further, CBI has initiated the extradition process in respect of 03 Fugitive Economic Offenders.*****
