In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps for conservation of water by regulating over exploitation of water and using new technologies for better utilization of water resources.Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a campaign for water conservation and water security, in 256 water-stressed districts of the country.Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for completion of 99 on-going Major Medium irrigation projects having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares. Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in various States including Maharashtra, which mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System) and better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources. It also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement Micro Irrigation.                  During 2016-17, 26 ongoing Major/Medium Irrigation (MMI) projects of Maharashtra under PMKSY-AIBP having ultimate potential of 8.50 lakh hectare have been prioritized for completion in phases by December, 2019.  Additional potential of 1.72 lakh hectare has been created through these projects during 2016-19. Further, during 2018-19, Government of India approved a special package for completion of 8 MMI and 83 Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) projects of Maharashtra, having estimated balance cost of Rs.13651.61 crore as on 01.04.2018. These projects are planned to be completed in phases by 2022-23.  Contd…P/2//2//Further, the CWC has also issued “Guidelines for Planning and Design of Piped Irrigation Network 2017” which show the comparative advantage of micro irrigation vis-à-vis conventional methods of irrigation. Government of Maharashtra has adopted a policy for Pipe Distribution Network for PMKSY projects. The Government has also made it compulsory for selected projects to supply irrigation water to sugarcane crop in command area through micro irrigation facilities. Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources. Aquifer maps and management plans have been shared with the respective State Government agencies.Central Ground Water Board is implementing innovative schemes for Aquifer Rejuvenation under ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme in select overexploited blocks of the aspirational districts on pilot basis. Water Harvesting and Recharge Augmentation are proposed to be piloted through construction of Bridge cum Bhandaras in parts of Maharashtra. Further, a joint Action Plan has been prepared with the Ministry of Rural development for effective implementation of water conservation and artificial recharge structures in convergence with MGNREGS. Nine water stressed blocks in the State of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have been identified, where work is in progress.Central Water Commission monitors live storage status of 120 reservoirs of the country on weekly basis and issues weekly bulletin on every Thursday. Whenever the current storage of reservoirs, being monitored by Central Water Commission, in a state falls below 80% of Normal (Average Storage of last ten years), advisory is issued to the concerned State Government for judicious use of available water. In the year 2019, Central Water Commission has issued advisory to the State Governments of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Tripura and Uttarakhand for judicious use of available water.Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
