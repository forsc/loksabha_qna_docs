ANSWER




(a) to (b)  Anganwadi Services (under  Saksham Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0 Scheme) is one of the flagship programmes of the Government of India and represents one of the world’s largest and unique programmes for early childhood care and development. The beneficiaries under this scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers. The package of following six services is provided under the scheme: i.	Supplementary Nutrition (SNP)ii.	Pre-school Non-formal Education, iii.	Nutrition & Health Education, iv.	Immunization,v.	Health Check-up, andvi.	Referral Services Three of the six services, viz., Immunization, Health check-up and Referral Services are related to health and are provided through NRHM & Public Health Infrastructure. The Scheme is implemented through State Governments/UT Administrations across the country (including NE States and UT of Ladakh). The Government of India releases grants-in-aid to the States/UTs presently on the following cost sharing ratio between Centre and States/UTs: 	Anganwadi Services (General)	Salary*	SNPStates/UTs with Legislature	60:40	25:75	50:50NE/ Himalayan States/UT of J&K	90:10	90:10	90:10UT without Legislature (including Ladakh)	100:0	100:0	100:0 *From 1st December, 2017, remuneration under Anganwadi Services Scheme is allowed only for selected staff of Anganwadi Services. POSHAN Abhiyaan was launched on 8th March 2018 with an aim to achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children under 6 years, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. POSHAN Abhiyaan addresses malnutrition issues across the nation through components like ICT Application, Convergence, Community Mobilization, behavioural Change & Jan Andolan, Capacity Building, Incentives and Awards, and Innovations. Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, Aanganwadi Workers (AWWs) are empowered with the provision of Smartphones and Growth Monitoring Devices (GMDs) procured through Government e-Market (GeM) for efficient service delivery. The mobile application of POSHAN Abhiyaan digitizes and automates physical registers used by Aanganwadi workers. This saves the time of AWWs and AWHs, and improves the quality of their work while simultaneously allowing them real-time monitoring.The number of beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services in the NE States and UT of Ladakh are placed at Annexure-I. The status of funds released to States/UTs (NE States and UT of Ladakh) during 2020-21 and the current year under Anganwadi Services is placed at Annexure-II and fund released under POSHAN Abhiyaan (NE States and UT of Ladakh) is placed at Annexure-III.  The status of smartphones procurement, GMDs procurement and funds released under POSHAN Abhiyaan to States/UTs (NE States and UT of Ladakh) as on 1st  January 2022 is at Annexure IVA and IVB. Anganwadi Services is an ongoing Scheme of Government of India. Revamping of Anganwadis is a continuous process for which various steps have been taken from time to time for improving the conditions of Anganwadi Centres across the country. Following measures have been taken for upgradation of facilities at Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across the country (including North-Eastern States and Union Territory of Ladakh) : (i)        Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) have been provided with Smart Phones for efficient service delivery. Details of Smartphones given to AWWs in North-Eastern States and Union Territory of Ladakh is at Annexure-IVA. (ii)      Streamlined guidelines were issued on 13.01.2021, covering several aspects such as quality assurance, roles and responsibilities of duty holders, procedure for procurement, integrating AYUSH concepts and Data management and Monitoring through ‘Poshan Tracker’ for transparency, efficiency and accountability in delivery of Supplementary Nutrition.  Smartphones have been provided to AWWs for data feeding in Poshan Tracker.   The Ministry is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme namely Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme under which support is provided to States and UT Governments for delivering services for children in need and difficult circumstances.  The Child Care Institutions (CCIs) established under the CPS scheme support inter-alia age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. and covers both rural and urban children.   The Ministry regularly engages with all State/UTs and has shared various advisories from time to time and guidelines for continued and uninterrupted delivery of services and also for effective implementation of the scheme.    State-wise statement of funds released, number of CCIs and beneficiaries covered in the North-Eastern States and UT of Ladakh Under Child Protection Services Scheme during the last three years and current year is at Annexure-V.    Further, the Hon''ble Prime Minister has announced PM CARES for Children scheme to support children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian or adoptive parents due to COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme is accessible through an online portal i.e. "pmcaresforchildren.in".  The applications of such children are uploaded on the portal by the respective State/ UT Governments. ******** Annexure-IStatement of AWCs sanctioned & Operational, SNP and PSE beneficiaries under ICDS as on 30.06 2021Anganwadi Centres Sanctioned and Operational, SNP & PSE Beneficiaries under Anganwadi Services  Scheme Quarter Ending 30 June, 2021                                                S.
