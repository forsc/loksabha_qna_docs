ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) Water being a State subject, steps to contain over exploitation of water in the country are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. The Government of India has formulated National Water Policy 2012 which recommends that declining ground water levels in over-exploited areas need to be arrested by introducing improved technologies of water use, incentivizing efficient water use and encouraging community based management of aquifers. In addition, wherever necessary, artificial recharging projects should be undertaken so that extraction is less than the recharge. This would allow the aquifers to provide base flows to the surface system, and maintain ecology. The National Water Policy was sent to States/UTs for appropriate action.Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a campaign for water conservation and water security, in 256 water stressed districts of the country including Punjab.Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared a conceptual document titled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water” which provides information about area-specific artificial recharge techniques to augment ground water resources based on the availability of source water and capability of subsurface formations to accommodate it. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.11 crore artificial recharge/rainwater harvesting structures in urban and rural areas, including about 4.5 Lakh artificial recharge/ rain water harvesting structures in Punjab. The Master Plan is available in public domain and has also been circulated to the State Governments for implementation including the Government of Punjab.Contd…P/2//2//Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3 (3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA has issued directives to all States / UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water / rain water harvesting.Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources. Aquifer maps and management plans have been shared with the respective State Government agencies. In Punjab, 50368 km2 have been covered.Model Building Bye Laws 2016 released by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs includes provisions for rainwater harvesting and it has been shared with all the States. So far 32 States / UTs have adopted the provisions of rainwater harvesting of MBBL-2016 including Punjab.Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for completion of 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares. In Punjab, two projects namely “Extension of Kandi Canal Stage-II” and “Rehabilitation of 1st Patiala Feeder & Kotla Branch” were included under 99 prioritized projects of PMKSY and have since been reported as completed in 2016-17. An amount of Rs.139.24 crore and Rs.36.27 crore have been given to the Government of Punjab as Central Assistance for these projects respectively. Further, Shahpur Kandi Dam Project, Relining of Rajasthan Feeder, Sirhand Feeder Project and Kotla Branch Part-II Project are currently receiving funding under PMKSY in Punjab.Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Per Drop More Crop component of PMKSY in Punjab, among other states, which mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System) and better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources. From 2015-16 to 2018-19, Rs. 53.18 crore has been released under PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop to Punjab and Rs. 15 crore has been allocated during 2019-20. National Water Mission under Ministry of Jal Shakti has organized a workshop “Sahi Fasal” in Amritsar on 14.11.2019 for sensitization of public for water conservation with the theme “Increasing Water Use Efficiency in Agriculture and Sahi Fasal”. A similar workshop was held in New Delhi on 26th & 27th November 2019, with experts in the field of agriculture & water management.Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
