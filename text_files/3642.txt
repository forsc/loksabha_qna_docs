ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d):    As Public Health is a State subject, the primary responsibility to fill up the posts of AYUSH doctors/practitioners including Homoeopathy & Unani and AYUSH drug inspectors and maintaining their status comes under the purview of respective State/UT Government. However, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM), the components for setting up of upto 50 bedded integrated AYUSH hospitals and upgradation of exclusive standalone State Government AYUSH Hospitals inter-alia are having provision for contractual deployment of AYUSH doctors. In this regard, State/UT Governments are required to submit their proposals through State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) as per the guidelines of the scheme.
