                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 101 FOR 06.12.2021 ASKED BY SHRI NATARAJAN P.R., HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING ENGINEERING PROGRAMME IN INDIAN LANGUAGES(a) to (d): National Education Policy-2020 (NEP 2020) does not envisage One Year Engineering Programme in Indian Languages. However, NEP-2020 has made recommendations for use of mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually in the higher education system.	In this regard, Government has taken a number of steps including:(i) 	All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has given approval to nineteen engineering colleges to impart engineering courses in six Indian languages for engineering programmes across ten states from the Academic year 2021-22. The details are as follows:<pre>S.No.	Languages	States	Examination1	Hindi	Rajasthan,Haryana,Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh	Bilingual2	Telugu	Andhra Pradesh	3	Marathi	Maharashtra	4	Bengali	West Bengal	5	Tamil 	Tamil Nadu	6	Kannada	Karnataka	</pre>(ii) AICTE has developed a tool called “AICTE Translation Automation AI Tool” with a vision to translate English language online courses into eleven different Indian languages for access to a more significant number of students in the rural area.(iii)  The government is working towards translating reference materials for courses of engineering in major regional languages. Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM) is a Govt. of India’s own Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform, which has been offering online courses in disciplines such as Science, Engineering & Technology, Humanities & Social Sciences, Law, Management etc. This is a continuous activity and some of the popular SWAYAM courses, including Transcription of Video, are translated into Indian languages, so that learners can select a language of their choice and learn the courses better in their local language. *****
