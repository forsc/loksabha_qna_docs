ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN] (a) to (c)	Government of India attaches high importance to bringing back mortal remains of Indian nationals who die abroad. As per the information available with the Ministry, during Covid-19 pandemic, from 1 February to 15 August 2020, 5286 cases of deaths of Indian nationals were reported in the Gulf and East Asian countries. The country-wise list of these cases is attached at Annex I. The Ministry has facilitated transportation of 1807 mortal remains from Gulf and East Asian countries during this period, despite the difficulties faced due to disruptions in international air travel caused by Covid-19 pandemic. In some cases, the last rites of the deceased have been performed locally as per the wishes of their family members. Our Missions and Posts abroad are constantly following up the cases of Mortal Remains transfer with local authorities and are extending all possible assistance for their early repatriation. ***
