                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	 In the case of Government medical colleges, the respective State Governments are responsible for fixation of fee and in the case of private unaided medical colleges, the fee structure is decided by a Committee set up by the respective State Governments under the Chairmanship of a retired High Court Judge in pursuance of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It is for the Committee to decide whether the fee proposed by an Institute is justified and the fee fixed by the Committee is binding on the Institute.  The fees charged in Government medical colleges in India is typically minimal. The fees in private and deemed colleges is higher but comparison with fee charged in neighbouring countries cannot be made as the data regarding fees charged in those countries including China for MBBS course is not maintained centrally.(d) & (e):	 As and when complaints regarding fees are received against medical colleges in this regard, such complaints are referred to the concerned State Governments.
