                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Delhi to Nanded flight had commenced on 19.11.2018 by Air India and was discontinued on 21.03.2020 due to lock-down. Currently, Nanded is connected by air to Mumbai and Amritsar.;After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the extant relevant guidelines in this regard
