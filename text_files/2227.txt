ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Routes from Nashik (Ozar) to Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Delhi, Goa, Hindon and Hyderabad have been awarded under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). As per Summer Schedule - 2019, scheduled air services connecting Nashik (Ozar) to Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have been started. M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited was operating a flight from Nashik (Ozar) to Delhi, which has been discontinued due to suspension of operations by the airlines. With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) with a view to achieve better air transport services for different regions of the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of RDG issued by Government. Government has no plan to revive discontinued flight from Nashik (Ozar) to Delhi.;(d): Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal for revival of existing un-served/under-served airports/airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions.;Ministry of Civil Aviation has sanctioned Rs. 17.67 crores towards Capital Expenditure for revival of Nashik (Ozar) Airport under RCS - UDAN.
