                                                        MINISTER OF LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a): Government is implementing Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) since 2016 with the objective to incentivise employers for creation of new employment and also aimed to bring informal workers to the formal workforce. Under the scheme, Government of India is paying Employer’s contribution i.e. 12% for a period of three years to the new employees earning upto Rs. 15,000/- through EPFO. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary through establishment was 31st March 2019. The beneficiaries registered upto 31st March, 2019 will continue to receive the benefit for 3 years from the date of registration under the scheme i.e. upto 31st March, 2022. (b): Subsidy disbursed in Assam and Rajasthan since inception of PMRPY scheme till June 2021 is Rs. 9.49 crore and Rs. 307.58 crore, respectively. (c):  Employees benefited in Assam and Rajasthan since inception of PMRPY scheme till June 2021 is 11311 and 463148, respectively. (d): The scheme was estimated to benefit 20 lakh beneficiaries. As on 15thJuly, 2021, benefit has been provided to 1.21 crore beneficiaries through 1.53 lakh establishments.  (e): Campaigning for increasing the awareness about the scheme was done through various modes of media viz. print media, television advertisement, radio FM channels, cinema theatre etc. Besides this, to increase the awareness among employers and employers’ associations, seminars and meetings were also conducted.  The details of the scheme were also displayed on the website for dissemination among the employers and the employees.(f): The terminal date of registration of beneficiaries under PMRPY was 31st March, 2019 but incentive in respect of registered beneficiaries is to continue for a period of three years from the date of joining. Hence, incentive for employers to retain such beneficiary workers on their rolls in form of payment of employer''s share of contributions (12% of wage) by Government was available to the employer during the period of lockdown.  During the COVID Pandemic period, the Government with the purpose of preventing disruption in employment of low wage earning EPF members in EPF covered establishments employing up to hundred employees, ninety percent with wage less than Rs.15,000/- per month, paid the employee''s and employer''s share of EPF & EPS contributions (24% of wages) for the period from wage month March, 2020 to August, 2020 under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) was launched as a part of Aatmanirbhar Bharat 3.O package to incentivize employment generation in EPFO registered establishments during Covid recovery phase by payment for a period of two years, of both employee’s & employer’s contributions i.e. 24% of wages in respect of new employees in establishments employing up to 1000 employees & only employee’s EPF contributions i.e. 12% of wages in respect of new employees in establishments employing more than 1000 employees with effect from 1st October, 2020. The new employees under the scheme include those who lost their jobs during Covid-19 and didn’t join in any EPF covered establishment upto 30.09.2020. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary under the scheme has been extended from 30th June, 2021 to 31st March, 2022.*****
