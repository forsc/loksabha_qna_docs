ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE  (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	Omicron variant is designated by WHO as a variant of concern, on the advice of WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE). This decision was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes. While there is limited available data and no peer-reviewed evidence on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness for Omicron, Omicron variant is expected to have increased ability to evade immunity as compared to prior variants, causing re-infections in those who have had a previous infection and in those who have been vaccinated. However, vaccine protection occurs through antibodies as well as through cellular immunity, which is expected to be relatively better preserved. Hence vaccines are expected to offer protection against severe disease and vaccination with the available vaccines remains crucial. Based on the population estimates from Registrar General of India (RGI), 89.63 Crore adult population (95.5%) has received a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine as on 02.02.2022.(b) &(c) The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), jointly initiated by the Health Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) with Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), is a consortium of laboratories to monitor the genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2. Initially, 10 labs and now with the addition of government and private labs, the consortium has 52 laboratories. Omicron variant is the dominant variant in the country, presently. The details of Covid-19 cases given in Annexure.(d)	Since 3rd January, 2022 COVID-19 vaccination has been initiated for the age-group 15-18 years and provision has also been made for administration of precautionary 3rd dose for the healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above 60 years of age with co-morbidities since 10th January, 2022, COVID-19 vaccine is made available free of cost for all citizens of the country aged 15 years and above, irrespective of their socio-economic status at all Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs).(e)	The Co-WIN Portal has made necessary provisions to record Precaution Dose administered to eligible due beneficiary. Also provisions for data editing/modification are available on Co-WIN like spell corrections in name, corrections of age, gender, Photo ID Card Number.
