                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  DGCA receives details of passenger complaints from the scheduled domestic airlines as a part of monthly submission of traffic data. The details of month wise passenger complaints for the Year 2018 & 2019 is placed at Annexure I.(b): Travel by air is a contractual agreement between airline and their passenger. Therefore, aggrieved passengers are required to lodge his/her complaint to respective airlines. As per prevailing regulation, airline/airport operators are required to appoint a Nodal officer and Appellate Authority to settle passenger grievances in a stipulated time frame. Airline/Airport Operators are required to conspicuously display the details of Nodal Officer and Appellate Authority on their respective website & display in a conspicuous manner at key areas of the airport.Airlines/airport operators shall ensure that all the complaints are acknowledged immediately to the complainant and redressed at the earliest. In case of non-redressal of the matter within the stipulated time frame, the complainant has the option to lodge his complaint at "AirSewa" web-portal/mobile application or take up the matter with any other statutory body set up under relevant applicable laws for resolution. Further, Ministry of Civil Aviation has also announced a charter for passengers that informs the air passengers of the rules and rights applicable to their air travel in an easy to understand format. However, at this stage there is no proposal to set up a tribunal to address passenger complaints.
