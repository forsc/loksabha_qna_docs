ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):  ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to attacks on students and journalists. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. An advisory specifically on safety of journalists was issued to States/UTs on 20th October 2017 requesting them to strictly enforce the law to ensure the safety and security of media persons. These advisories are available on the Ministry’s website: www.mha.gov.in. *****
