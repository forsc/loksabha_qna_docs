                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):	The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommended strategies to achieve the same. The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress as per these recommendations. Due to the efforts made as part of schemes/ programmes of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare which also aligns with the strategy of doubling farmers’ income, there has been an appreciable improvement in efficiency bringing about a positive impact in the agriculture sector. 	National Horticulture Board (NHB) has received a large number of proposals from the farmers of Maharashtra State including project proposals pertaining to protected cultivation under (Poly House/Shade Net House) under the ‘Development of Commercial Horticulture through Production and Post-Harvest Management of Horticulture crops’ Contd….2/- Scheme during the last three years and current financial year. NHB has issued In-PrincipleApproval (IPA) for the eligible proposals in the State of Maharashtra under above mentioned scheme of NHB. Year-wise details are at Annexure.	As regard information about acceptance or rejection of the proposal, the status of every project is available at nhb.gov.in under the link “NHB Interactive- Track Application Status”. In addition, applicants are also informed through letters.	The subsidy of NHB helps farmers to get relief of interest burden provided they are eligible as per Scheme Guidelines.
