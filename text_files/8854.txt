                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (e): Against total stocks of 604.82 LMT (as on 01.11.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), was 758.80 LMT (as on 31.10.2019) comprising 623.23 LMT in covered godowns and 135.57 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of Central Pool foodgrains at the national level. A total of 586 private godowns have been hired by FCI on rent (as on 31.10.2019). The District-wise and State-wise details are at Annexure-I.........2/--2-The foodgrains are stored scientifically with various preservation measures like fumigation and treatment with pesticides. In spite of taking necessary care and precautions, small quantities of foodgrains may become non-issuable due to various reasons like natural calamities, damages in transit, negligence of officials etc., for which action is invariably taken. During 2018-19, the foodgrains damaged in FCI were 0.05 LMT and for 2019-20 (up to 31.10.2019) are 0.009 LMT.However, depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government implements the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos for storage of Central Pool Stocks in the country:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, CWC and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. A capacity of 143.08 LMT has been created as on 31.10.2019.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies.ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds from annual budgetary allocation are released by the Government of India to FCI and also to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2022. A capacity of 49,425 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.10.2019.iii.	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.10.2019, steel silos of 7.25 LMT capacity have been created.(f): 	A total of 12 private godowns have been constructed by FCI in Uttar Pradesh during the last five years. The district-wise details are at Annexure-II.****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2520 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 03.12.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State-wise and district-wise details of private godowns hired on rent by FCI as on 31.10.2019 are as given below: STATE/UT/DISTRICT	NO.
