ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Airports Authority of India(AAI), the implementing agency, had identified Neyveli Airport owned by Neyveli Lignite Corporation in the 1st round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik). The Airport operator is in the process of obtaining airport license for ARC Code-2B. The network / route connecting Neyveli airport was awarded to Selected Airline Operator(SAO) in the first round of bidding under RCS-UDAN. However, as the SAO did not comply with contractual obligations, the network / route was cancelled by the Airports of Authority of India, the implementing agency. In the subsequent rounds of biddings  no valid bid has been received under the Scheme for operations of RCS flights from Neyveli airport, so far. Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. RCS - UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. Ulundurpet Airport figures in the tentative list of unserved airports in UDAN Document. No airline has submitted  proposal to operate RCS flight from Ulundurpet, so far. If any bid is received in future round of bidding under RCS-UDAN, the same shall be considered as per the provisions of Scheme Document.
