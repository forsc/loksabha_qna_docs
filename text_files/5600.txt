                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION.(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (c): Ever since inception of NITI Aayog w.e.f. January 1, 2015, there has been a renewed thrust on Centre State relations through cooperative federalism recognizing that strong States make a strong Nation.  A number of initiatives have been taken by NITI Aayog to foster cooperative federalism through structured support initiatives and mechanisms of engagement with the States/ Union Territories (UTs) on a continuous basis.  These include (i) Periodical meetings of the Governing Councils chaired by the Prime Minister with participation of Chief Ministers of States/ Lieutenant Governors of UTs;  (ii) Setting up sub-groups of Chief Ministers on subjects of national importance; (iii) Periodical meetings between Vice Chairman/ Members of NITI Aayog with the Chief Ministers and other senior Officials of the States/ UTs; (iv) Development Support Services for States for infrastructure and social sector projects; (v) Sharing of best practices; (vi) Policy support and capacity development of State/ UT functionaries; (vii) Aspirational Districts Programme for development of backward districts; (viii) Theme based extensive engagements in various sectors; (ix) Framing model laws for land leasing and agriculture marketing reforms; (x) Promotion of digital payments; and (xi) Area specific interventions for North Eastern, Himalayan States and Island development.  To promote competitive federalism and improving outcomes of developmental interventions, NITI Aayog has been endeavoring to improve States’/UTs’ performances by encouraging healthy competition through transparent ranking in various sectors with a handholding approach.  Some of the indices launched include Health Index, Composite Water Management Index, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index and Performance of Aspirational Districts.  Dynamic ranking portals have been put in place to facilitate States/ UTs to feed data and monitor their performance in various sectors vis-à-vis other States/ UTs, including third party validation of data.                                                                 *****
