Details of such schemes being implemented by KVIC are given below:1.	Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth.  Under this scheme, rural women are eligible for a higher margin money subsidy of 35% for setting up micro-enterprises in rural areas, which is more than the margin money subsidy for the General category.PMEGP, since inception in 2008-09 and upto 11.03.2022 has assisted 1,62,555 women by providing Rs. 4,97,770.40 lakh Margin money subsidy to establish their enterprises.2.

Under Gramodyog Vikas Yojana (GVY), KVIC provide training, toolkits and other hand holding support to rural traditional artisans through implementation of following programmes:i)	Honey Mission/Beekeeping: This programme aims at providing livelihood to people living in rural areas by introducing and popularizing modern Beekeeping and thereby creating sustainable employment and income. Under the programme, each beneficiary is being provided with 10 bee boxes with live bee colonies and tool kits.  So far, since the start of the programme in 2017-18, a total of 3303 women beekeepers have been trained and provided with bee boxes and tool kits.ii)	Kumhar Sashaktikaran Programme started in the year 2018-19. KVIC assists pottery artisans by providing Electric Pottery Wheels alongwith other tools and equipments.  A total of 2590 women artisans have so far been assisted through the programme since its inception.4.

Ministry of MSME also assists artisan clusters through ‘Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries’ (SFURTI) to generate sustainable employment for traditional rural artisans, and to improve the standard of living of rural women. KVIC is one of the nodal agency for implementing this scheme.  At present, 107 SFURTI clusters out of the total of 458 clusters, are sanctioned to KVIC, in which around 23000 women artisans are engaged.
