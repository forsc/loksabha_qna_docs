The Ministry of Panchayati Raj on 24th April, 2018 launched the restructured Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) by way of capacity building and training (CB&T) for their Elected Representatives (ERs) for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the priority to aspirational districts and cluster under Mission Antyodaya. The scheme has programmatic focus for basic orientation training within six months and refresher training within two years in respect of approx 31 lakhs of Panchayats out of which sizable number (42%) are  elected women representative (EWRs). RGSA also focuses on Self Help Group (SHG)-PRI convergence to ensure effective community mobilisation and greater women participation in social, economic and political activities.
