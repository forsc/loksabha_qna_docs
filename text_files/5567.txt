                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5150 BY SHRI SUNIL KUMAR PINTU TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019 REGARDING SEPARATE COUNTERS FOR WOMEN/SENIOR CITIZENS(a) & (b): Separate reservation counters are earmarked at various Passenger Reservation System (PRS) centres for dealing with the reservation requisitions received from persons with disability, senior citizens, former Members of Parliament, Members of Legislative Assembly, accredited journalists and freedom fighters, if the average demand per shift is not less than 120 tickets.  In case there is no justification for earmarking of an exclusive counter for any of these categories of persons including ladies, senior citizens, or persons with disability, one or two counters depending upon the total demand are earmarked for dealing with the reservation requests for all these categories of persons.  Further, as per extant guidelines, if the daily average number of transactions at any reservation counter is 180 or more, Railways can take action to open additional reservation counters subject to availability of manpower, space and other infrastructure.            At Sitamarhi and Janakpur Road Railway stations, one reservation counter functioning in both the shifts has been provided at both the stations.  An analysis of number of reservation related transactions has revealed that on an average 225 transactions are handled at Sitamarhi per day (approximately 113 transactions per shift) whereas that at Janakpur Road is 60 per day. As such, at present, there is no justification to open separate additional reservation counter for ladies, senior citizens and persons with disability at Sitamarhi and Janakpur Road Railway stations.(c) & (d): Sitamarhi & Janakpur Road Railway stations fall under NSG4 & NSG5 category stations respectively. These two stations have also been developed under ‘Adarsh Station Scheme’. Passenger amenities more than the minimum essential amenities required as per norms for these category of stations have been provided at Janakpur Road and Sitamarhi Railway stations. Moreover, upgradation of stations by providing additional amenities is a continuous and ongoing exercise.*****
