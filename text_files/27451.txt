ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	There is no proposal under consideration to extend the special package for garments/ apparel to home textile segment.              However, to boost exports and enhance competitiveness, of the complete textiles sector including home textiles, Government had announced a Special Package for garments and made-ups sectors in 2016. The package offered Rebate of State Levies (RoSL), labour law reforms, additional incentives under Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) and relaxation of Section 80JJAA of Income Tax Act.	 Government has sanctioned Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Man Made Fibre & Technical Textiles segment for 10683 Crore. Government has also announced setting up of Mega textiles Park to help Indian Textiles Industry in achieving scale and efficiency to become more competitive. Government has also launched National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) with support of Rs 1480 Crore for research in sunrise segment of Textiles Industry.Further, the Government decided to rebate taxes/ levies by introducing Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) w.e.f. 07th March, 2019 for garments and made-ups (home textiles) replacing erstwhile RoSL. The Union Cabinet has given its approval on 14th July,  2021 for continuation of RoSCTL with the same rate as notified by Ministry of Textiles vide Notification dated 8th March, 2019 on exports of Apparel/Garments (Chapters-61 & 62) and Made-ups   (Chapter-63) in exclusion from RoDTEP scheme for these chapters. The RoSCTL scheme will continue till 31st March, 2024. The other textiles products (excluding Chapter 61, 62 and 63) which are not covered under the RoSCTL shall be eligible to avail the benefits, if any, under RoDTEP along with other products. All exporters exporting the products under Chapter 61, 62 & 63 are eligible for benefits under RoSCTL, no matter from which States/UTs they belong to.***
