ANSWER




                                                                    THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                   (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b): Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission  (SCM)  on  25th  June  2015. 100  Smart  cities have been selected through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018. 5,151 projects worth of ? 2,05,018 crore have been proposed by the 100 Smart Cities as part of their Smart City Proposals (SCPs). 11 cities in the State of Tamil Nadu i.e., Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, Thanjavur, Tiruppur, Salem, Vellore, Coimbatore, Madurai, Erode, Thoothukudi and Chennai have been selected for development as Smart Cities. As part of their SCPs, these 11 Smart Cities from Tamil Nadu have proposed 618 projects worth    ? 15,307 crore. The implementation of SCM at City level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. SPVs plan, implement, operate and monitor projects encapsulated in their SCPs.  At the State level, a High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) has been set up for coordinating Mission implementation. Since Smart City SPVs are empowered to take decisions regarding Mission projects under the overall guidance of the State HPSC, there is no need for them to submit projects for approval to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Hence, the question of pendency at Central Government level does not arise.(c) & (d):  The cities under SCM have shown considerable progress since their inception. As on 12 November 2021, 6,452 projects worth ? 1,84,998 crore (90%) have been tendered, out of which 5,809 projects worth ? 1,56,571 crore (85%) are under implementation/completed. The period of implementation of SCM has been extended upto June 2023 and all Smart Cities are expected to complete their projects within the stipulated time.                         ******
