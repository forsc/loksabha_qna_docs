THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (d):  The Central Government has initiated the One District One Product (ODOP) in different States/UTs of the country. ODOP is seen as a transformational step towards realizing the true potential of a district, fuelling economic growth, generating employment and rural entrepreneurship, taking us to the goal of AtmaNirbhar Bharat.  ODOP initiative is operationally merged with ‘Districts as Export Hub’ initiative being implemented by DGFT, Department of Commerce, with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) as a major stakeholder. Department of Commerce, through DGFT, is engaging with State and Central Government agencies to promote the initiative of ODOP in a phased manner. The objective is to convert each District of the country into an Export Hub.   Products/ services (including GI products, agricultural clusters, toy clusters etc.) with export potential in each District have been identified including those belonging to conventional craft and small scale industries, like Wooden Craft(carving), Iron and Metal Craft, Udaigiri Wooden Cutlery, Phulkari, chinkarari, Phulkari etc. Further, State Export Promotion Committee (SEPC) and District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) have been constituted in all the 36 States/UTs.Invest India, the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency, is taking up several activities such as conducting craft and design workshops, training workshops and e-commerce onboarding drives under ODOP to support and create employment opportunities for the conventional craft and small-scale industries.  106 Products have been identified from 103 districts across the country for such support. The district-wise details of products identified under One District One Product (ODOP) initiative may be seen at Annexure. ******
