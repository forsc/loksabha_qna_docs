The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. 56 unserved / underserved airports including 5 heliports and 2 water aerodromes have been operationalized under RCS- UDAN so far. The primary objective of RCS is to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by connecting unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes. The scheme is applicable for 10 years. Airport Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency conducts e-bidding from time to time and award bids to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) for connecting unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes across the country as per the provisions of the scheme document.
