ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. State Government of Maharashtra has informed that an Expert Study Committee was appointed to suggest remedial measures to decrease flood effects in Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts of Western Maharashtra. The Committee has submitted its report in October, 2021 and Government of Maharashtra has accepted its recommendations.(b)  State Government of Maharashtra has informed that restrictions are imposed by Krishna water Dispute Tribunal (KWDT-II) award on Inter basin transfer of water. Hence, it is not possible to divert water from flood affected river basin to drought prone river basin. However, presently flood water is being lifted through Lift Irrigation Schemes within the basin for supplying to drought prone area.(c ) State Government of Maharashtra has informed that Koyna Dam has been  included in World Bank assisted Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Program (DRIP-II) for its detailed hydrological and structural review.*****
