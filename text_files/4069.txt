MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):  	   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.--2--STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *339 FOR 16.07.2019The Central Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to ensure effective surveillance and domination of international borders to check infiltration of illegal migrants.  Physical infrastructure like border fencing, floodlighting, construction of border roads and establishment of border outposts has been created.  Vulnerable border outposts are regularly reviewed and strengthened by deploying additional manpower, special surveillance equipments and other force multipliers. A technological solution in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) has been implemented in some vulnerable border areas.  	Border guarding forces conduct regular patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunnelling exercises to stop illegal infiltration.  However, some illegal migrants are still able to enter into India in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, mainly due  to  difficult  mountainous  and  riverine   terrain in parts of the long international borders.  	Detection and deportation of illegal immigrants is a continuous and ongoing process. To deal with such illegal immigrants, the powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to detect, --3--L.S.S.Q.NO. 339 FOR 16.07.2019detain and deport illegal foreign nationals and powers under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to remove an illegal foreigner by force have been entrusted under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India to all the State Governments. Further, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, Administrators of all Union Territories including Delhi have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to the aforesaid powers.  	Central Government has also issued consolidated instructions regarding deportation/repatriation of foreign nationals to all States & UTs vide MHA letter No.25022/19/2014-F.I dated 24.04.2014.  Further advisories have also been issued to the State Governments/UT Administrations regarding identification of illegal migrants and monitoring thereof, vide MHA letter No.24013/29/Misc./2017-CSR.III(i) dated 08.08.2017 and letter No.25022/63/2017-F.IV dated 28.02.2018	  National Register of Citizens (NRC) Assam was prepared in 1951 as a  non-statutory   process   by   recording   particulars  of   all   the  persons enumerated during 1951 Census. The exercise to update NRC 1951 is being conducted under special provisions in respect of State of Assam under The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.******
