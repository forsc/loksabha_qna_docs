                                                                                  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                       MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	Bangalore Metro Rail Project Phase – 2, 2A and 2B are being implemented by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) in Bengaluru city. BMRCL has informed that as on February 2022, the physical and financial progress of Phase-II is 64% and 65% respectively and that of Phase 2A and 2B is 15% and 15.5% respectively. Out of the total sanctioned length of 72.1 kms of Phase-II, 13.65 km is operational. (b)	No, Sir.(c) to (e)	Metro Rail Projects undertaken with central financial assistance are implemented by Joint Venture Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), which are Board run companies with representations from Central and respective State Governments. The progress regarding project implementation is reviewed by the Board periodically and the problems encountered in project implementation are addressed suitably. The decision regarding terminating contracts, retendering or blacklisting contractors is taken by the Metro Rail corporations against defaulting contractors. Some of the Metro Rail corporations have informed that contractor’s delay in meeting the deadlines is one of the reasons for delay in project. Only Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has informed that project cost has increased on account of delays by contractors. Metro Rail companies including CMRL are using Project Management Information tools to keep close watch on the performance of contractors for taking prompt corrective action to avoid time and cost overrun attributable to different reasons including on account of delays by contractors.                                  *****
