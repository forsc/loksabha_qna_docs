ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b)   The Gram Panchayats adopted under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) prepare  Village Development Plans (VDP) comprising different projects to be taken up for implementation in the SAGY Gram Panchayats under different schemes of the Central and State Governments with the approval of the Gram Sabha and District Level Committee headed by the District Collector. The Ministry provides training on preparation of VDP and the approaches to convergence of schemes to the Charge Officers of the state who coordinate the implementation at the local level and are fully responsible and accountable for the implementation of VDP. The implementation of the VDP  is monitored through Saanjhi portal / MIS of SAGY maintained by the Ministry wherein the State and District officials update the progress of implementation of the projects taken under the VDP. As the entire programme is implemented in a convergence mode, the District Collector plays a significant role. As per the SAGY guidelines, the District Collector is  the nodal officer for implementing SAGY. The District collector conducts review meetings with representatives of the participating line departments for effective implementation of the VDP. The State Level Empowered Committee (SLEC) on SAGY, headed by the Chief Secretary, reviews the implementation of schemes in the SAGY GPs to ensure seamless convergence of schemes among different State Government Departments. The scheme Guidelines have been prepared in 14 languages ( English, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Malayalam, Assamese, Kashmiri, Konkani and Oriya) and uploaded on the portal saanjhi.gov.in. The guidelines have been distributed to all the stakeholders with the view to achieve the intended objectives of the scheme. The Ministry has prepared a compendium on SAGY containing supporting materials that helps the various stakeholders in the implementation of SAGY which has been distributed among the participants during the training programmes. Also, the Ministry has prepared a compilation titled ‘Samanvay’ containing 127 central and 1,806 state schemes available for village development for the benefit of SAGY Gram Panchayats which has been shared with the States for facilitating convergence. (c) Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is implementing the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of new micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth. A total of 6.53 lakh micro enterprises have been assisted generating employment for an estimated 53.8 lakh persons.  Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) supports traditional artisans and organizes them in clusters for sustainable employment.  335 clusters have been approved benefitting 1.98 lakh artisans.*****
