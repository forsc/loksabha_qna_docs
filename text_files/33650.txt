ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a)	The scheme of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Shashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) implemented during the period 2012-13 to 2015-16 was a demand driven in nature and involved multi-dimensional activities. Funds were sanctioned on the basis of annual plan proposals of States as approved by the Central Executive Committee of RGPSA. Releases were normally made in two instalments, the first instalment being 50% of the sanctioned amount after deducting the unspent balance available with State at the time of release. The quantum of release of first instalment, therefore, depended on the unspent balance available with the State, utilization certificate and physical-financial progress reports furnished etc. The States including Tamil Nadu which had high unspent balances and had not provided utilization certificates etc were not eligible for full releases, thus resulting in the gap between sanctioned and released amounts.(b)	& (c) Since RGPSA was a demand driven scheme, there were no pre-set targets. The financial and physical achievements under the scheme during 2015-16 including Tamil Nadu are given in Annexure-I & II. As the scheme was implemented only upto 2015-16, no funds were released under this scheme since 2016-17.(d)	Under RGPSA, States had taken up Capacity Building & Training of stakeholders on a large scale, including e-enablement and resource centres, thereby increasing the capacity of Panchayati Raj Institutions.****
