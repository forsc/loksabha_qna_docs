The list is at Annexure-I.(b) & (c) The Ministry has plans to issue chip enabled e-passports to citizens with advanced security features. The personal particulars of the applicants would be digitally signed and stored in the chip which would be embedded in the physical passport booklet. In case, anyone tampers with the chip, the system shall be able to identify it resulting in the failure of the passport authentication.	The Government has given its approval for procurement of electronic contactless inlays for manufacturing of e-passports to India Security Press (ISP) Nasik. In this regard, ISP, Nasik, has been authorized to float a Global three-stage tender for procurement of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)-compliant electronic contactless inlays along with its operating system which is required for manufacture of e-passports. Manufacture of e-passport will commence on the successful completion of the tendering and procurement process by ISP, Nasik.(d) & (e) The Government of India launched the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) card scheme in August 2005.  The erstwhile Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card scheme, which was started in the year 1999, was merged with OCI scheme in 2015.  OCI card holders do not require any visa to visit India. ***
