During a virtual meeting between Hon’ble Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and the Fiji’s Minister for Agriculture, Waterways & Environment, held on 22nd June, 2021, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for cooperation in the field of Agriculture and allied sectors was signed virtually by both Ministers. However, the MoU shall enter into force on the last date of signature by the Parties, which is yet to be done.(b)	The benefits likely to accrue to both the countries from the MoU,  are in the nature of capacity building, knowledge exchange through visits of scientists and technicians, development of agricultural  infrastructure,   human resources and dairy industry, promotion of joint ventures between private sectors and investment in marketing &value addition/downstream processing of agricultural commodities, etc. .
