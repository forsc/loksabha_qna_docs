Government has adopted proactive approach and briefed members of the international community on the facts. They have been apprised of Pakistan’s continued aid and abetment to cross-border terrorism against India, including in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.As a result of Government’s efforts, Pakistan’s attempts to interfere in internal affairs of India; to present an alarmist situation of the region; and its abuse of international fora including United Nations have been successfully and effectively thwarted. Countries have shown understanding that matters related to Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, are internal to India. Countries have also called on Pakistan to not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner. They have also acknowledged that issues, if any, between India and Pakistan should be addressed bilaterally and peacefully.***
