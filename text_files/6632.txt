                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	Any organic food manufactured, packed, sold, offered for sale, marketed or otherwise distributed in the country is regulated as per the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (Organic Food) Regulations, 2017, which were notified on 29.12.2017 and enforced from 01.07.2018. These regulations require Organic Food to comply with the provisions of National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) or Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). However, to support small original organic producer or producer organisation, those with annual turnover not exceeding 12 lakhs per annum have been exempted from certification through NPOP or PGS. The Organic food covered through these regulations should bear FSSAI organic logo i.e. jaivik Bharat Logo.(b):	Ground water pollution may happen due to seepage of chemicals, hazardous waste etc. into the soil that can impact the crops.However, in case of organic food products, the quality is assured through residual tests before certification.Contd…2/--2-(c):	There is difference in the prices of organic produce compared to that of non organic Produce. Among other factors the price difference may be mainly attributed to the demand and supply gap.(d):	Dedicated schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) have been initiated since 2015 for supporting the organic farming in the country. Under these schemes, support is provided for    cluster/FPO/FPC formation, capacity building of farmers, input procurement for production, post harvest infrastructure development and marketing. Organic farming is also promoted under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY).      ******
