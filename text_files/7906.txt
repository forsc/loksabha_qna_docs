The throw-forward for these projects is of the order of `1.84 lakh crores and all out sincere and focussed approach is being adopted by Railway for quick execution so as to get early returns to Railways.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion of the project.Therefore, confirmed timeline cannot be given. However, sincere efforts are being done to complete the project early.For capacity enhancement projects, institutional financing arrangement has been done for `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision.*****
