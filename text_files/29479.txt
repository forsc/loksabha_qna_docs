                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                                                   [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a):   As per the input provided by the Department of Financial Services, Public Sector Banks are established under the State Bank of India Act, 1955 and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/80 and are not companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act) or under any previous company law. As such, the provisions of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provided in Section 135 of the Act are not applicable to Public Sector Banks.       All data related to CSR filed by companies in MCA21 registry is available in public domain at www.csr.gov.in. On the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA 21 registry, details of CSR funds spent by the companies, including private sector banks incorporated under the Act, in different States /Union Territories (UTs) (including Tamil Nadu) during the last three financial years are annexed.Cont…2/-2-As per the Act, companies are required to hold Annual General Meeting (AGM) within six months from the end of financial year. Thereafter, financial statements and board reports containing disclosures about CSR, are to be filed in MCA21 within 30 days of the AGM. In view of the disruption caused by COVID-19 pandemic, Registrars of Companies have accorded extension of time till 30th November, 2021 for conduct of AGMs by companies. The Ministry vide General Circular No. 17/2021 dated 29.10.2021 has relaxed the levy of additional fees till 31.12.2021 for filing of financial statement in respect of the financial year 2020-21. (b):   Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendations of its CSR Committee. The CSR framework is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in the MCA21 registry. The CSR mandated companies are required to provide additional information in their Profit & Loss Account regarding amount of expenditure incurred on CSR activities and the same is required to be audited by the statutory auditors of the company. Further, the Board of the company is also required to disclose the CSR Policy implemented by the company in its Board report. Thus, the corporate governance framework along with the existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide adequate safeguards in this regard.(c):   Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies is initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. Earlier CSR related defaults were compoundable offences.  So far, sanction for prosecution has been accorded in 366 cases. Of these, 148 applications for compounding have been made and 75 cases have been compounded.  Further, the non-compliance of CSR provisions has been converted as a civil wrong w. e. f. 22nd January, 2021.  (d):   SEZ-wise data is not maintained by the Ministry. However, on the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA 21 registry, CSR spent by all the companies in Thiruvannamalai District of Tamil Nadu during the last three financial years are as follows: District	 FY 2018-19	 FY 2019-20	FY 2020-21 Thiruvannamalai (INR Cr.)	0.32	5.43	0.37(Data upto 30.09.2021) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]******AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1378 FOR 06.12.2021State /UT-wise CSR expenditure (in Cr.)S.
