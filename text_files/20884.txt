ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) : 	Yes Sir, the Central Government is sensitive to the needs of poor students  and is committed towards ensuring equity in access to higher education. The Government has passed One Hundred and Third Amendment in the Constitution of India regarding implementation of 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWSs) for admission in Central Education Institutions. Also, the fee in Government Universities and colleges for general courses is generally nominal and fee waiver is also extended to the poor students.Apart from that, the facility of education loan as well as interest subsidy on educational loan is also available to students and a good number of Nationalized Banks extend this facility to needy students. Further, in accordance with the national policy, number of schemes being implemented to ensure that access to higher education in India percolates effectively to the weaker and marginalized sections of society thereby facilitating the entry of the underprivileged in the mainstream of civic-public life through education.(b)	 List of schemes administered by Government of India for the poor students is at Annexure I.  (c) and (d):  All Central Universities have a health care centre and supporting staffs have been sanctioned for health care centre. In addition, all the HEIs have been advised to create the Students Counseling Centers in their university and its affiliated colleges where the services of a trained psychologist shall be used as and when required.  Guidelines on Safety of Students on and off Campuses of HEIs framed by UGC have been issued to all HEIs.  ****
