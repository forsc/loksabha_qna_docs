                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????(??. ???? ?????)  (a) to (d) : A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT AS REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 165 FOR 12.02.2021 REGARDING “POLICY FOR SCIENTIFIC SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ”(a) to (d):  Department of Science and Technology (DST) has prepared a draft policy for Scientific Social Responsibility. The draft Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy seeks to harness the latent potential of the scientific community on voluntary basis, strengthening science and society linkages and thereby making S&T ecosystem responsive to societal needs.  This primarily involves bridging science-society, science-science and society-science gaps, thereby bringing trust, partnership and responsibility of science at an accelerated pace towards achieving social goals.          The draft policy provides for implementation in the country through participation of the varied stakeholders like laboratories, institutes, universities and colleges, and their knowledge workers, science centres, central ministries, state governments, their departments, and associated autonomous agencies.          Some of the SSR activities include delivering lectures by scientists in schools and colleges, writing popular articles in media, sharing infrastructure and knowledge resources, S&T based empowerment of women and weaker sections of the society by awareness building, training programs, skill development through training and workshops, demonstration of solutions and technologies, etc.           The beneficiaries of the SSR activity comprise of any community, group, entity or individual viz. students, teachers, women’s groups; farmers; self-help groups; self-employed; informal sector enterprises; micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs); startups; NGOs, etc.          The draft policy to be coordinated by Anchor Scientific Institutions (ASI) at the district level, State S&T Councils (SS&TCs) at the state level and by the Programme Monitoring Unit (PMU) of DST at the national level. A national portal would form a platform for linking the stakeholders and the coordinating agencies including society and for reporting of SSR activities and outcomes in the country.          The draft policy does not involve any significant financial implication, as all SSR Implementers, both in public and private, shall design their own action plan based on their overall SSR objectives to be adequately incentivized through internal budgetary support and manpower resources. For this purpose, a modest grant to be set aside in each research grant for SSR activities.          The draft policy has the potential to bring scientific and innovative solutions to societal problems, especially for the marginalized sections of society, and imparting thrust to the new initiatives of Government such as Transformation of Aspirational Districts, Make in India, Swachh Bharat and Digital India in achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development towards making India a self-reliant nation (Atma Nirbhar Bharat).**********
