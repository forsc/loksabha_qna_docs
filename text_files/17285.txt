Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 10.05 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1343 as per current population estimate of 135 crore. The details of number of doctors registered with the concerned State Medical Council State/UT-wise are at Annexure. Besides, there are 7.88 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors in the country. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 6.30 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors may be actually available for service and considered together with allopathic doctors, it gives a doctor population ratio of 1:825. The number of MBBS seats has been increased by 48% over the last six years (from 54,348 in 2014 to 80,312 in 2020). The number of PG seats has increased by 79% over the same period (from 23,503 in 2014 to 54,094 in 2020). The Government has taken various steps to further increase the availability of human resource in the country which include:i.

Colleges are allowed to apply for PG medical courses in clinical subjects at the time of 4th  renewal. It will serve to advance the process for starting PG medical courses by more than 1 year.x.
