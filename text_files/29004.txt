                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) to (c):    Caste based discrimination is a social evil which still exists in the country and it can be eradicated through the social movements. This ministry contributes to this effort by taking steps to abolish untouchability, providing level playing field for all to progress and providing equal economic and educational opportunities for all. This ministry also incentivizes Inter-Caste marriages, where one of the spouses is a member of scheduled castes.                Moreover, an Act of Parliament i.e the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 prescribes punishment for the enforcement of any disability arising from preaching and practice of untouchability, which usually emanate from caste-based discrimination. Further, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) {PoA} Act, 1989 is also in force to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. As per the data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of cases registered under these Acts for crime/atrocities against the members of SCs and STs in the last two years are as under :-Year	Cases registered under the PCR Act, 1955	Cases registered under the SC/ST (PoA) Act, 1989 (with IPC)2019	 16	 496082020	 25	 53886*****
