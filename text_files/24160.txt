Till now, eight such meetings have been conducted via Video-Conferencing on 13.04.2021, 23.04.2021, 06.05.2021, 13.05.2021, 20.05.2021, 27.05.2021, 03.06.2021 and 10.06.2021.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(d) to (e):	Ministry of Labour & Employment is developing a comprehensive National Database for Unorganized Workers (NDUW) seeded with Aadhaar for all Unorganised workers including Construction Workers, Migrant Workers, Gig and Platform workers, Street Vendors, Domestic Workers, Agriculture Workers, Migrant workers and similar other workers, seeded with Aadhaar to address various challenges and issues related to the delivery of benefits of welfare schemes meant for them. The process for dry run and security audit is underway.  National Informatics Centre (NIC) is the technical partner in the project and Rs. 45.39 Crore has already been released to NICSI for required software development and hardware purchases in January/ February 2021.
