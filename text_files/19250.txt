ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Cases of the private hospitals arbitrarily overcharging from the patients that come to light from time to time have been taken note of by the Government. As per constitutional provisions, ‘Health’ is a State subject. However, the Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 (CE Act, 2010) for registration and regulation of clinical establishments (both Government and Private) in the country, which has been adopted by 11 States and 5 Union Territories. The Act among other things has provisions for charging rates for each type of procedure and service within the range of rates determined from time to time and for display of rates at a conspicuous place etc. Further, as “Health” is a State subject, it is the responsibility of the respective State/Union Territory (UT) Government to take cognizance of complaints and take punitive steps against such erring private hospitals. Such complaints, as and when received, are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government, for necessary action, as per the provisions of the Act and Rules, as applicable to them. Details of such complaints are not maintained centrally.(c) & (d):	No such committee/team has been setup Centrally to monitor such incidents/complaints. However Clinical Establishments Act, 2010 provides for a District Registering Authority (DRA) in each district and a “State Council for Clinical Establishments” at State level, for implementation and monitoring of the provisions of the aforesaid Act and rules there under.
