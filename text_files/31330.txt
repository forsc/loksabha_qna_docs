DGCA worked in closed coordination with National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) to empanel two verification bodies to carry out verification activities on CORSIA for the airlines.;(c) India has filed reservations at the 40th ICAO Assembly in 2019 regarding the current structure of CORSIA. The matter has been taken up at Council level through Representative of India at ICAO Council.
