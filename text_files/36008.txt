ANSWER




  MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): The share of coal in power generation of the country for the last 2 years and the current fiscal upto February’22 is as under: (Figures in Billion Units)Period	Total generation (Including Renewable)	Coal Based Generation	% of coal based generation v/s total generation2018-19	1376.1	987.7	722019-20	1389.1	961.2	692020-21	1381.9	950.9	692021-22 (Apr-Feb)	1351.7	938.3	69 Thus, the share of coal-based power generation in the total power generation is in the range of 69-72%.(b): The details of coal receipt and its consumption in thermal power plants during last 3 years and current year 2021-22 (Apr- Feb) are as under:                                                                     (Figures in Million Tonnes)Period	Coal Receipt 	Coal Consumption2018-19	643.7	628.92019-20	638.7	622.22020-21	596.3	615.42021-22 (Apr-Feb)	629.3	631.5During 2018-19 and 2019-20, the receipt of coal was more than consumption. However, during 2020-21 and 2021-22 (Apr-Feb), the receipt was less than consumption as the power plants met their requirement from coal stock. Further, the coal stock available at the power plants as on 16.03.2022 is about 26.3 MT which is about 39% of their normative requirement.(c): The average per day coal supply to the Thermal Power Plants from domestic coal sources has gradually increased in the last few months. The daily domestic coal supply from CIL, SCCL and captive coal blocks  for the month of  December, January, February of this Financial year has been 2.049 MT/day, 2.022 MT/day and 2.135 MT/day respectively (provisional).  (d): Following action has been taken by Government to enhance the production and supply of coal in the country:i.	Commercial Auction of coal on revenue share mechanism: Auction of commercial mining on Revenue Sharing Mechanism was launched on 18.06.2020 by Hon’ble Prime Minister. Under this scheme, total of 2 tranches have been successfully completed and third Tranche is currently under process. From these two tranches total of 28 coal mines have been successfully auctioned for which Vesting order have in signed for 27 coal mines. ii.	Allow sale of excess coal production: The Ministry of Coal has amended Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 with a view to allowing sale of coal or lignite, on payment of additional amount, by the lessee of a captive mine up to 50 percent of the total coal or lignite produced in a financial year, after meeting the requirement of the end use plant linked with the mine.  The Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act had been amended in 2021. This is applicable for both the private and public sector captive mines. With this amendment, the Government has paved the way for releasing of additional coal in the market by greater utilization of mining capacities of captive coal and lignite blocks,which were being only partly utilized owing to limited production of coal for meeting their captive needs.iii.	Rolling auction: In order to expedite the process for conducting auction and to carryout more rounds of auction in a year, a mechanism of rolling auctions of coal mines has been planned. Under this mechanism, upon completion of the electronic auction process of a tranche, the next tranche of auction would be launched for following mines:a. Mines where no bid or only single bid was received in the previous tranche of auction (except for those mines where Ministry of Coal decides to go for second attempt of auction)b .New mines, if any, identified by Ministry of Coal.In the current III tranche of commercial auction, total of 48 coal mines have been rolled over from the II tranche of mines.iv.	Single Window Clearance: The Union government has already launched Single Window Clearance portal on 11.01.2021 for the coal sector to speed up the operationalisation of coal mines. It is an unified platform that facilitates grant of clearances and approvals required for starting a coal mine in India. Now, the complete process shall be facilitated through Single Window Clearance Portal, which will map not only the relevant application formats, but also process flow for grant of approval or clearances.v.	Coal India Ltd. has envisaged a coal production programme of one Billion Tonne from CIL mines.  CIL has taken the following steps to achieve the target of augmentation of coal production capacity:1.	15 Projects identified with a Capacity of about 160 MTPA (Million Tonnes per Annum) to be operated by Mine Developer cum Operator mode.2.	Capacity addition through special dispensation in Environment Clearance under clause 7(ii) of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 20063.	CIL has taken steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading system under ''First Mile Connectivity'' projects. (e): Raw coal production of subsidiaries of Coal India Limited and other coal mines was affected by rain mainly in June’21 and Sept’21. The percentage growth of Coal India Limited as a whole for the months of June 2021 to September 2021 is given below:    Month	% Growth as compared to same period of last yearJune 2021	2.0July 2021   	14.0August 2021	14.6September 2021	0.4Thus, the production was more severely effected in the months of June and September 2021. Further, about 0.55 MT coal production was also affected in SCCL due to extended rains in the months of October 2021 and cyclone in November 2021.   ****
