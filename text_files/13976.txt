In accordance with this, the Government has taken various steps from time to time to create awareness of the provisions of the POCSO Act through electronic and print media, consultations, workshops and training programmes with stakeholders concerned. In order to generate awareness about the POCSO Act, a short clip (duration 45 seconds) on POCSO Act was disseminated in Cinema Halls and Doordarshan across the nation from 02.10.2019 to 08.10.2019. Further, letters have been written by Secretary, WCD to all the States/UTs for taking necessary action for awareness and sensitization in schools on issue of child safety and prevention of child sexual abuse. Under Samagra Shiksha, school safety pledge has been initiated. The Government has also directed all Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan across the country to display awareness content on POCSO on their notice boards or any other prominent place in the schools. School Safety Pledges are also being taken in schools with appropriate messages on Child Safety and Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Minister, Women and Child Development (WCD) has written to all the Chief Ministers, Members of Parliament, and Heads of local Bodies/Panchayati Raj Institutions to take all necessary measures for effective implementation of the POCSO Act, 2012 as amended in 2019. Secretary, WCD has also written a letter to this effect to all the Secretaries of line Ministries and Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs.Further, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) are also mandated to monitor the implementation of the POCSO Act, 2012.Moreover, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including children, rest primarily with the respective State Governments and UT Administration. The State Governments and UT Administrations are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.****** ANNEXURE-IStatement Referred To In Part (a) of Reply To Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.2627  For Answer On 06.03.2020 raised by SHRI BALUBHAU ALIAS SURESH NARAYAN DHANORKAR on “CONVICTIONS UNDER POCSO ACT” indicating State/UT-wise Conviction Rate (CVR) and Persons Convicted (PCV) under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act During 2014-2015SL	State/UT	2014	2015		CVR	PCV	CVR	PCV1	Andhra Pradesh	10.0	29	16.7	852	Arunachal Pradesh	50.0	1	-	03	Assam	40.0	8	37.5	154	Bihar	23.6	22	42.3	245	Chhattisgarh	34.9	263	48.2	5626	Goa	37.5	3	36.1	157	Gujarat	11.1	5	13.6	88	Haryana	19.3	119	30.4	1499	Himachal Pradesh	36.2	33	31.4	3710	Jammu & Kashmir	5.9	1	4.5	111	Jharkhand	59.1	15	56.0	2812	Karnataka	20.6	29	13.7	3213	Kerala	34.0	51	40.7	10014	Madhya Pradesh	32.7	848	30.0	94415	Maharashtra	15.5	129	21.9	21916	Manipur	-	0	25.0	117	Meghalaya	100.0	7	28.6	218	Mizoram	90.2	38	88.6	10219	Nagaland	100.0	1	66.7	420	Odisha	13.5	16	13.5	4021	Punjab	39.3	121	38.4	20722	Rajasthan	35.5	152	38.7	16723	Sikkim	65.5	3	55.2	1624	Tamil Nadu	31.5	65	34.1	14325	Telangana	15.1	35	9.5	4226	Tripura	22.5	11	25.0	1427	Uttar Pradesh	53.0	410	65.5	124128	Uttarakhand	38.1	20	66.4	8529	West Bengal	12.0	22	19.8	22 	TOTAL STATE(S)	29.9	2457	35.9	430530	A&N Islands	57.1	4	-	031	Chandigarh	46.7	22	40.5	2232	D&N Haveli	-	0	0.0	033	Daman & Diu	33.3	1	-	034	Delhi	35.3	202	42.8	23835	Lakshadweep	-	0	-	036	Puducherry	-	0	100.0	2 	TOTAL UT(S)	36.6	229	42.8	262 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	30.4	2686	36.3	4567Source: Crime in IndiaANNEXURE-IStatement Referred To In Part (a) of Reply To Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.2627  For Answer On 06.03.2020 raised by SHRI BALUBHAU ALIAS SURESH NARAYAN DHANORKAR on “CONVICTIONS UNDER POCSO ACT” indicating State/UT-wise Conviction Rate (CVR) and Persons Convicted (PCV) under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act During 2016-2018SL	State/UT	2016	2017	2018		CVR	PCV	CVR	PCV	CVR	PCV1	Andhra Pradesh	9.3	52	9.3	9	6.5	92	Arunachal Pradesh	0.0	0	-	0	50.0	13	Assam	35.2	43	31.1	53	21.6	734	Bihar	46.9	24	49.3	35	71.2	1365	Chhattisgarh	36.9	378	34.2	409	34.0	3796	Goa	23.6	13	-	0	-	07	Gujarat	7.7	6	9.8	17	13.5	368	Haryana	20.8	130	31.3	218	35.7	3509	Himachal Pradesh	23.1	31	100.0	1	0.0	010	Jammu & Kashmir	6.3	1	-	0	-	011	Jharkhand	20.0	17	37.8	25	29.5	4112	Karnataka	19.4	58	20.0	139	19.4	19013	Kerala	18.9	53	32.0	33	36.0	8414	Madhya Pradesh	26.0	792	31.4	492	39.4	59815	Maharashtra	23.7	279	27.1	566	28.6	58316	Manipur	11.1	1	100.0	4	100.0	417	Meghalaya	82.4	28	83.3	5	59.3	1618	Mizoram	96.4	54	69.6	48	87.1	3319	Nagaland	54.5	9	64.3	16	81.8	920	Odisha	11.5	48	5.1	11	18.8	2421	Punjab	32.2	98	23.5	79	35.3	10522	Rajasthan	39.1	168	44.1	110	45.5	11923	Sikkim	52.9	9	65.5	23	39.7	3524	Tamil Nadu	27.1	214	19.6	180	23.1	35625	Telangana	7.9	32	10.3	38	12.5	7226	Tripura	43.6	25	44.2	21	26.0	1427	Uttar Pradesh	49.4	1003	72.3	1796	63.5	165228	Uttarakhand	90.5	45	81.0	17	66.7	2829	West Bengal	21.3	48	18.0	41	28.9	103 	TOTAL STATE(S)	29.1	3659	33.0	4386	33.4	505030	A&N Islands	20.0	0	4.2	1	0.0	031	Chandigarh	45.2	19	0.0	0	100.0	132	D&N Haveli	28.6	2	23.1	3	8.3	133	Daman & Diu	-	0	-	0	60.0	334	Delhi	41.9	179	46.2	110	59.1	24235	Lakshadweep	-	0	-	0	-	036	Puducherry	-	0	-	0	0.0	0 	TOTAL UT(S)	41.8	200	41.1	114	56.7	247 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	29.6	3859	33.2	4500	34.2	5297Source: Crime in India
