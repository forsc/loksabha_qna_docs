ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)&(b)	Yes. Son Beel is one of the largest natural water body in Asia where during winter season, it becomes suitable for paddy cultivation and during rainy season, it is full of water and fish breeding takes place naturally. In the early parts of winter season, birds from different areas migrate in Son Beel. As per revenue records, Son Beel is surrounded by 100 nos. of villages and more than 50,000 population is directly dependent on Son beel for their livelihood by way of fishing and paddy cultivation.  (c) As reported by the State Govt. of Assam, to avert harm to the migratory birds, forest staff is deputed to perform patrolling in Son Beel area and as a result 3 offence reports have been drawn and 7 offenders have been arrested and sent to judicial custody for trial. (d) & (e) As informed by the State Government of Assam, Fishery Department and Assam Tourism Development Corporation have taken some developmental works in Son Beel. However, till date, no proposal has been received by Government of India from the State Government of Assam asking for funds for conservation, restoration, rejuvenation and management of Son Beel under National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystem (NPCA) scheme.   ***
