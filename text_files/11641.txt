ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 582 BY SHRIMATI RITI PATHAK TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.02.2020 REGARDING ONGOING RAILWAY PROJECTS(a) and (b): Proposals/suggestions/representations, both formal and informal regarding Railway projects are received from State Governments, Ministries of Central Government, elected representatives, organizations/rail users etc. by Railways at various levels including Railway Board, Zonal Railways, Division Office etc. As receipt of such proposals/suggestions is a continuous and dynamic process, centralized compendium of such requests is not maintained.  Request for new lines, gauge conversion and doubling in the country including development of ports & industries and their feasibility study etc. is a continuous and ongoing process of Indian Railways and is done based on demands raised by State Governments, Central Ministries, Members of Parliament, other public representatives and Railways’ own requirement.As on 01.04.2019, Indian Railways have taken up 498 Railway projects of 49,069 km length, costing `6.75 lakh crore, which are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which, commissioning of 8,979 km length has been achieved and expenditure of `1.53 lakh crore incurred upto March, 2019. Project-wise details of Railway projects are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget). These projects will help in development of ports and industries. (c): The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Hence, confirmed time line for completion of projects cannot be given at this stage. In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.  For capacity enhancement projects, institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects. *****
