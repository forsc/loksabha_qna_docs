ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a)  No, Sir. Considering overall work, about 74% of the works have been completed within 3 months of the contract completion date and additional 18% works within 03 months to 01 year from the contract completion date. Rest about 8% of works completed beyond 01 year from the contract completion date.(b)  DRDO works include construction works for various laboratories, establishments and units as well as strategic works. The Strategic works are of specialized in nature. Due to these nature of works, major reasons for delays are:•	 Most of the works are located in highly restricted areas i.e., inside the laboratories and in the premises of existing Strategic sites, where restrictions on movement of manpower and material have been imposed due to the unavoidable security reasons.•	 Certain Projects which are located in the remote areas have been affected by the local prevailing situations.•	 Mid-term revision in Qualitative requirements and additional technical requirements from Services were projected during the currency of the work to meet the functional requirements of the facility. •	 Due to Covid-19 Pandemic.•	 Other major issues contributed to delay in completion of work are lack of timely availability of construction material like aggregates, cement, steel, bricks etc., during the currency of work, unavailability of skilled manpower during the festive seasons have also affected the work.However, it is highlighted that midcourse corrections were undertaken on case to case basis in respect of the works and all the works have been completed without any financial escalation.(c)  Presently, all DRDO projects are on schedule, duly considering force majeure for work affected by Covid-19 Pandemic. (d)  There has been no cost escalation due to delay in the work. Changes and additional requirements have been paid as per actual.(e)  The remedial measures taken to complete the works in time are furnished below:•	 Periodic reviews of the Works were conducted and bottle necks identified. Additional resources such as manpower, materials and paint & machinery were deployed to make up for delays.•	 Users were approached and numerous meeting/ discussions were held with them for timely finalization of the changes/ additional works projected in order to complete the work at the earliest.•	 Works with justified reasons were granted extension of time based on the merit of each case.*****
