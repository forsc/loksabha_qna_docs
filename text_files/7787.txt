ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	From time to time, the Indian Missions abroad receive complaints regarding non-payment of agreed wages and cheating by employers. Many countries do not share data with others, including Indian Missions abroad on the figure of foreign employees in their country citing data privacy and similar laws. Resultantly, precise data of such cases are not available with the Government. However, as reported by the Indian Missions abroad, a statement showing number representations from NRI employees/workers working in various countries with regard to non-payment and cheating by employers is annexed.(c)	On receipt of complaints from or on behalf of the emigrants, the same are addressed urgently by the Indian Missions by suitably taking up the issues with the concerned local government authorities for resolution. Complaints pertaining to employment related issues are also taken up by the Indian Missions directly with the concerned foreign employer, wherever possible, for prompt redressal. ***
