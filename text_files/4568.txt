ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	 to (d)  There is no specific scheme to revive the river system by carrying out rain water harvesting. However, the Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for river rejuvenation. The work of development of River Ganga and its tributaries is undertaken by Ministry of Jal Shakti under National Mission for Clean Ganga. The development work for rest of the rivers is undertaken under the National River Conservation Plan. A number of States have also taken up rejuvenation of small rivers under schemes like MGNREGAA National Perspective Plan for Water Resources Development has been formulated by MoWR, RD & GR for transfer of water from surplus river basins to water deficit river basins.Hon’ble NGT vide order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No 673/2018 has directed State Governments and UT Administrations for preparation of action plans and its execution within 2 years (from 1st April, 2019) for bringing all the polluted river stretches to be fit at least for bathing purposes. The action plans to be prepared by River Rejuvenation Committee of concerned State includes various aspects such as source control (municipal sewage management, industrial pollution control, waste management), river catchment/basin management (adoption of good irrigation practices, utilization of treated sewage, ground water recharge aspects), flood plain zone protection and its management (setting up of bio-diversity parks, removal of encroachments, plantation on both sides of the river), environmental flow, watershed management and rain water harvesting.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of State Governments, Ministry of Jal Shakti provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments through various schemes. Under the National River Conservation Plan, project proposals received from the State Government are considered for financial assistance on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Government. As intimated by the Government of Madhya Pradesh, at present, there is no proposal for conservation of Kanthi river.*****
