ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & b):  	In view of surplus stocks of  sugar in the country, the Government has imposed stock holding limits on sugar mills w.e.f. June, 2018 to prevent over supply of sugar in the domestic market, to stabilize domestic price of sugar and to maintain demand-supply balance. This ensures a level playing field to all the sugar mills in the country.  No stock holding to 17 per cent of total production on foodgrains are placed.(c) & d):   	Yes, Sir. A request was received from the Government of Tamil Nadu to exempt sugar mills in Tamil Nadu from monthly stock holding limit. The limits of sales/dispatch of all sugar mills are determined on the basis of well-defined and uniform criteria so that interest of all the sugar mills in the country are protected. As such, any special dispensation to sugar mills in Tamil Nadu does not appear feasible.****
