ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                    (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	& (b) :  Urban Transport is intertwined with Urban Development, which is a State subject.  As such, initiatives for assessment of public transport systems including non-motorised transport, urban mobility and long term development goals in the area of urban transport, are taken by the State Governments / Union Territories.  However, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs have reassessed the overall public transport scenario in view of COVID-19 pandemic, and devised a three-pronged strategy for public transport in the form of short, medium and long term measures and an advisory has been issued to all the State/UT Governments in this regard. Further, in order to promote non-motorised transport, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has launched ‘India Cycles4Change Challenge’ to promote cycling infrastructure and ‘Street4 People Challenge’ to encourage development of walkable streets and neighbourhoods under the Smart Cities Mission and to guide the cities through online workshops, technical knowledge material and peer-to-peer learning discussions with fellow cities.                                           *****
