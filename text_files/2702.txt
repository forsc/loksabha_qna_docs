                                                        (a) to (c)       National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership company under Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has conducted an impact evaluation of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna 2.0 (PMKVY) 2016-2020, the short term skill training programme run by MSDE . The study has indicated that individuals trained and certified under Short Term Training (STT) are 1.8 times more likely to get employed and there is 9 % and 15 % increase in employment and their average monthly income respectively. Under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) certification, individuals have been benefitted in terms of increase in self-confidence, improvement in technical knowledge, soft-skills and average monthly income. A tracer study was conducted for long term training by Directorate General of Training in 2012. As per the study, the employment of passed out trainees was 63.5%.	A State/UTs wise detailed statement of trained and placed people under PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) is given at Annexure. MSDE does not capture data for placement exclusively for Government Sector.
