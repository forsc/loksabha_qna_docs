ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      \(GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) For the purpose of bilateral air service agreements, the Government classifies airports as metro airports (6 airports viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) and non-metro airports (all other airports). Kannur International Airport is a non-metro airport.(b) and (c) Yes, Sir. The Government is aware that Kannur International Airport serves passengers from the northern region of Kerala and neighbouring regions of Karnataka.;(d) and (e) Kannur International Airport was commissioned in December 2018. Within a period of one year, by Winter 2019 schedule, Indian carriers were operating 65 international services per week from Kannur, before scheduled international commercial passenger services were suspended on account of COVID-19 pandemic.;Currently, due to significant imbalance in the number of points of call in favour of foreign carriers, the Government of India is not granting any non-metro airport as a new point of call to any foreign carrier for the purpose of operating passenger services. However, Indian designated carriers are free to mount scheduled operations to/from any international airport including Kannur International Airport to foreign destinations under the ambit of bilateral air service agreements concluded by India with foreign countries.
