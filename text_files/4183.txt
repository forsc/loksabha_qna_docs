ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a)	Ministry of Panchayati Raj was implementing District component of Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) Programme in 272 identified backward districts in all States of the country except Goa during the period 2006-07 to 2014-15. The Programme was designed to redress regional imbalances in development by providing funds for supplementing and converging existing developmental inflows in the identified districts. Untied grants were provided to State Governments for the identified districts based on their Annual District Plans duly approved by the District Planning Committees. The annual budget allocation for BRGF was divided into two components, namely Capacity Building Grant and Development Grant. The State Government decided the inter-se allocation among the local bodies and to each level of these bodies on the basis of the index or formula accepted within the State to determine backwardness or level of development. (b)	Fifteen (15) districts of Chhattisgarh were covered under the BRGF Programme. The names of these districts are at Annexure.(c)	The districts under the of BRGF Programme were selected on the basis of rank of backwardness on chosen parameters relating to income deprivation, health and education status, social backwardness and infrastructural inadequacy. (d) to (f)	No Sir. Consequent upon the implementation of the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, share of States in the net proceeds of the Union taxes has been significantly enhanced from 32% to 42% of the Centre’s net tax receipts. Hence, BRGF Programme has been delinked from the budgetary support of the Central Government since 2015-16.*****
