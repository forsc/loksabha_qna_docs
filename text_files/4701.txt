                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b): 	No Committee for Subansiri Hydro Electric Project has been constituted by the State Government of Assam. However, various technical committees / groups such as Expert Group (EG), Technical Expert Committee (TEC), Joint Steering Committee (JSC), Dam Design Review Panel (DDRP) and Project Oversight Committee (POC) were constituted from time to time by Govt. of India and NHPC to examine the safety aspects and downstream impact of the Project. Meanwhile, two Petitions were filed before Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT). Hon’ble NGT directed MoEF&CC to set up a three-member Expert Committee and stop the construction of the Project, except the works of emergency nature for maintenance and for public safety purpose. This Expert Committee was constituted by MoEF&CC on 27.11.2017. The Committee submitted its recommendations to MoEF&CC on 26.03.2019. The recommendations of the Expert Committee have been appraised by the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) and accepted by the Government subject to the final order of Hon’ble NGT for its implementation. The matter is still sub-judice in Hon’ble NGT.            	(c) : 		Project is likely to be commissioned within 4 years after resumption of works. 	(d) : 			Investment approval was accorded to the Project in 2003 for Rs.6285 Crs (Dec’02 Price Level). The estimated Revised cost of the Project is Rs.20850.67 Crs.
