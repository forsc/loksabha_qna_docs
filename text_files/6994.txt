ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Construction of new airports does not come under purview of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). However, once the routes are awarded through a transparent and demand driven bidding process by the airlines, development of concerned RCS airport is carried out under revival/upgradation of RCS airport scheme. Sarbhog Airport figures is in the list of unserved airport in RCS documents. However, no bid has been received for operation of RCS - UDAN flight. Therefore, upgradation/revival of Sarbhog airport could not be taken up.
