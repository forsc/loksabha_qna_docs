ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently as a result, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs). Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDG. However, the Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity. ;;Bhavnagar Airport is presently connected with Mumbai Airport through ATR-72 type of Aircraft. The existing runway of length 1920m x 45m is capable of handling ATR-72 type of aircraft and the existing passenger terminal building is capable of handling 100 departure and 100 arrival peak hour passengers at a time. The Apron has a capacity to hold one number of  B-737 Aircraft and one number of  ATR-72 type aircraft. The existing infrastructure is sufficient to handle present and additional traffic demand. The construction of isolation bay has been taken up by AAI at the cost of Rs. 3.8 crores.;
