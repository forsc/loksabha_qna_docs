                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has constituted committees to look into the matters related to reduction of Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) at the following levels:•	National level: National Level Maternal Death Surveillance & Response Committee (NMDSRC).•	State level: State Level Monitoring and Review Committee for MDR (SMRC-MDR)•	District level: District Maternal Death Review Committee. An Executive Committee has been set up under the Chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development with representation of line Ministries and States for nutrition related activities for children and women providing direction, policy and guidelines for implementation of various programmes/schemes under the POSHAN Abhiyaan.  (c) & (d)  The Ministry of Labour and Employment implements the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme for rehabilitation of child labourer. Under the NCLP, the children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/ withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  The children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The Scheme is implemented by District Project Societies under the Chairpersonship of the administrative head of the district, namely District Magistrate/Deputy Commissioner/District Collector of the district.To ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child Labour Act and smooth implementation of NCLP Scheme, a dedicated online portal named PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) has been developed for better monitoring and ensuring timely disposal of work with transparency. Further, Government has also enacted Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) which provides that a child who is found working in contravention of the labour laws for the time being in force and is found begging, or living on the street is considered as “child in need of care and protection.” The Act mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional and non-Institutional care to these children. The primary responsibility of execution of Act, as such, lies with the States/UTs.*******
