(c) & (d)   Most of the schemes/ programmes of Government of India have separate provisions for women and other vulnerable sections of the society.  Multi-pronged strategies are being taken by the Ministry of Rural Development to improve the economic well-being of the people in rural areas including that of women belonging to SC/ST/OBC and Economically Weaker Section with the main focus on increasing livelihood opportunities, empowering rural women, providing social safety net, skilling of rural youth, infrastructure development etc, through its programmes viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY),  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee National RuRBAN Mission and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). Out of these schemes/programmes, the following Schemes of the Ministry generate employment/enhance the employability including of women in rural areas, the details of which are given below:The Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), is a centrally sponsored anti-poverty programme launched in June 2011. The Mission seeks to reach out to all rural poor households in a phased manner and impact their livelihoods significantly. DAY-NRLM has been designed to be implemented in a Mission mode, with both the Govt. of India and the states sharing the cost. The Mission has covered 6360 blocks spread over 691 districts across 28 States and 6 UTs up to January’ 2021. This is a totally women oriented programme, as of date 7.35 crore women have been mobilized in 67 lakhs Self Help Groups (SHGs).Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) is a sub-scheme of DAY-NRLM with the objective to help the rural poor to set-up enterprises at the village level in non-agricultural sectors. Besides providing start-up capital, a cadre of Community Resource Persons-Enterprise Promotion (CRP-EP) is set up to provide business support services to enterprises. SHG members are supported under the project. SVEP does not have a state wise allocation of funds. Supplementary Annual Action Plans are submitted by States/UTs. Once approved, funds are released in three instalments of 25%, 50% and 25% respectively for implementation. So far 1.35 lakh enterprises have been sanctioned of which 72% are owned and managed by women rest 28% are run by family members of SHGs.The Ministry is implementing two Skill development initiatives for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to improve the economic condition of the rural population, namely, i. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development scheme for rural poor and ii. Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETI), which provides skilling, thereby enabling the trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs. Both the above mentioned schemes are applicable to all the categories including women. Under DDU-GKY, there is a mandatory coverage of 33% women. During the current FY 2020-21, out of the total trained, 51.03% are women and out of the total placed, 47.15% are women. Under RSETI, any unemployed youth in the age group of 18-45 years, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, gender and economic status, having aptitude to take up self-employment or wage employment and having some basic knowledge in the related field can undergo training. During the current FY 2020-21, Out of the total trained, 64.28% are women and out of the total settled, 63.71% are women.Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households including women belonging to SC/ST/OBC and economically weaker in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Being a demand driven programme, no State/UT-wise financial allocation is made.  The rate of participation of women in Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last three years and current year is above the statutory requirement of 1/3rd women participation. The details in this regard are as under:Financial Year	                       2018-2019	  2019-2020	         2020-21                                                                               (as on 04.03.2021)Percentage of participation of Women	54.59	            54.78	         52.94Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) has been implemented with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 Crore Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022.
