                                                        	                 THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                   MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a): & (b): Land and Colonization are State subjects. Therefore, schemes related to housing are implemented by States/ Union Territories (UTs). However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’, is supplementing the efforts of States/ UTs by providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries since 25.06.2015 through four verticals. Government of India is providing its fixed share as Central Assistance of ?1.0 lakh under In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), ?1.5 lakh for Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) & Beneficiary Led Individual Construction or Enhancement (BLC) verticals of PMAY-U. Under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) vertical of PMAY-U, an interest subsidy at the rate of 6.5% which amounts upto ?2.67 lakh per house is provided for beneficiaries of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Lower Income Group (LIG) category. The remaining cost of the house as per Detailed Project Report is shared by States/ UTs/ Urban Local Bodies/ Beneficiaries. There is no proposal to increase Central Assistance under PMAY-U for any States/ UTs including Madhya Pradesh.(c): As per the PMAY-U Scheme guidelines, the demand survey is conducted by States/ UTs to assess the actual demand of housing for eligible beneficiaries. Based on the demand, State/ UT Governments prepare project proposals under PMAY-U and after due approval of State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC) submit to the Ministry for sanctioning by Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC). The Ministry is open to consider proposals from States/ UTs during the Mission period i.e. before 31.03.2022.                                      *****
