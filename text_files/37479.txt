About 95% of total land plans have been uploaded on TMS portal and digitization of land record in Land Management module is a continuous process as railways continues to acquire land for its various projects. Also, Railway has planned to make its entire asset including land & buildings including encroachment details available on IR-Geo Portal.      Railways carry out regular surveys for identifying encroachments and take action for their removal. If the encroachments are of temporary nature (soft encroachments) in the shape of jhuggies, jhopris and squatters, the same are got removed in consultation and with the assistance of Railway Protection Force and local civil authorities.  For old encroachments, where party is not amenable to persuasion, action is taken under Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 (PPE Act, 1971), as amended from time to time.  Actual eviction of unauthorized occupants is carried out with the assistance of State Government and police. The vacant land including the land retrieved from encroachment is utilized for execution of various infrastructural projects of Railways. The vacant land, which is not required by Railways for its immediate operational needs, is utilized in the interim period for commercial development through Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), wherever feasible, in order to mobilize additional financial resources.    ******
