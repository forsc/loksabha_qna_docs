                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) ‘Panchayat’, being ‘Local Government’, is a State subject and part of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Accordingly, all Panchayat related matters, including elections to the Panchayats, are governed by the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts and rules. Further, Article 243C(5)(b) of the Constitution of India provides that the Chairperson of a Panchayat at the intermediate level or district level shall be elected by, and from amongst, the elected members thereof. (c) Ministry of Panchayati Raj had, considering the matter raised during zero hour on 11.12.2019 by an Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) on the need of direct election for chairperson of district and block Panchayat in Uttar Pradesh, sought views/suggestions of all States/Union Territories to amend Article 243C(5) of the Constitution of India. As per views/suggestions received, it was found that most of the States/Union Territories were not in favour of amendment in existing Constitutional provision relating to process of indirect election of chairperson of District Panchayat and Intermediate Panchayat.****
