ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): At present 491 Railway projects including 189 New Lines, 55 Gauge Conversion and 247 Doubling Projects are in different stages of execution/planning/sanction. The total length of these projects is 48860.64 km costing `6.476 Lakh Crore on which Commissioning of 9113 km length and expenditure of `1.43 Lakh Crore has been done up to March, 2019.During 2009-14, 7599 Km (1727 Km of New Line, 3997 Km of Gauge Conversion and 1875 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned at an average rate of 1519.8 Km per year. Since 2014-19, 13124 Km (3035 Km of New Line, 3993 Km of Gauge Conversion and 6096 Km of  Doubling Projects) have been commissioned at an average rate of 2625 Km per year, which is 172% of commissioning during 2009-14. The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground & over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological & topographical conditions of area, law & order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affects the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that project are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various level (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
