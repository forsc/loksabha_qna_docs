                                                        (a) & (b)  The road from Ratnagiri to Nagpur comprises 4 different NHs (NH-166, NH-211,NH-361 and NH-7) and 16 different project sub-sections. The road from Guhagar to Vijapur is NH 166E comprising of 6 different project sub-sections. The road from Manmad to Chikkodi has two different route options along National Highways. First route is from Manmad to Chikkodi via Pimpalgaon-Nashik-Pune-Miraj-Chikkodi, comprising of 5 different NHs (NH 752G, NH 60, NH 48, NH 166 and NH 160) and 8 different project sub-sections.

The details of ongoing works in above project stretches are annexed below. Some of the above project stretches were initially delayed owing to land acquisition, utility shifting & slow mobilization by the Contractor. These projects have been periodically reviewed at various levels in Ministry and necessary directions have been issued to all concerned including Contractor and officials to initiate necessary action for expediting the progress of works.(c) & (d)  The projects are reviewed periodically and if the reason for delay is attributable to the Contractor, the action as per provisions of Contract Agreement are being taken.
