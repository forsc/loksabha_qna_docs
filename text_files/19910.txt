During the current financial year (2020-21), the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has accorded approval to the proposals of 33 State Governments /Union Territories (UTs) including the proposal of Government of Uttar Pradesh for the benefit of about 2.87 lakh beneficiaries during the current financial year(2020-21) under the PMMSY.  The district-wise details of the number of farmers benefitted under the PMMSY during the current financial year (2020-21) in Uttar Pradesh as reported by the Government of Uttar Pradesh are furnished at Annexure-I. As the PMMSY has been implemented with effect from the current financial year(2020-21), release of funds under this scheme during the last three years does not arise. *****
