ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):   Many studies have been conducted worldwide including in India about the harmful effects of tobacco. These studies have confirmed that tobacco is a major cause of premature deaths and is a major risk factor for various non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, stroke, lung diseases, sudden infant death syndrome, impotence etc. Various studies have also suggested that forty percent of the tuberculosis burden in India may be attributed to smoking. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemi¬cals, and at least 69 of them have been identified as carcinogens. There are 3095 chemical components in smokeless tobacco products (including gutkha), among them 28 are proven carcinogen. The major and most abundant group of carcinogens is the tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA). As per the estimates given in the 2nd round of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS-2) report (2016-17), mortality due to tobacco in India is estimated at upwards of 1.3 million.As per the Report on “Economic Burden of Tobacco Related Diseases in India”, the total economic costs attributable to tobacco use from all diseases in India in the year 2011 for persons aged 35-69 amounted to Rs. 1,04,500 crores. (b):   The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, the apex body in the field of biomedical research released “White Paper on Electronic Nicotine Delivery System” on 31.05.2019. Uses of ENDS or e-cigarettes have documented adverse effects on humans which include DNA damage; carcinogenesis; cellular, molecular and immunological toxicity; respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological disorders and adverse impact on foetal development and pregnancy.(c) & (d):  There is ban on food products containing tobacco or nicotine, such as Gutkha, under the Food Safety Regulations issued in 2011 under the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006 and currently there is no such proposal to impose complete ban on tobacco completely. However, under COTPA, 2003, there is prohibition of smoking in public places, ban on sale of cigarette or any other tobacco product to and by persons below the age of eighteen years, ban on sale of cigarette or any other tobacco product within 100 yards of educational institutions and ban on promotion/advertisement of cigarettes or any other tobacco products. ............................
