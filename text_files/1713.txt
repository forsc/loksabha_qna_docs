Interest rates on loans could vary from time to time and be based on credit profile of the borrowers. The bank-wise and State-wise information on interest rates charged on agriculture loan by various banks across the country are not maintained centrally.With a view to ensure availability of agriculture credit at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a. to the farmers, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare implements an interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh. The scheme provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to Banks on use of their own resources.  Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. (c): NABARD has intimated as follows:•	Agriculture Credit Target is allocated considering Gross Cropped Area, Gross Irrigated Area, past achievements and targets, regional distribution of credit flow to address the regional disparity. •	Credit flow to agriculture during the last six years is as under:(Rs.Crore) Years 	Crop Loan Disb.
