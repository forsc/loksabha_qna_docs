MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are consideredonly if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/StateGovernments / Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources forsetting up a new KV as well as the availability of necessary sanction of theGovernment. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities foropening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the“Challenge Method”.No proposal in prescribed proformae for opening of a new KV at Benipur andBirul block in Darbhanga has been received from the Government of Bihar so far.(c) Yes, Sir. KV No. 2 Darbhanga (Bihar) is running temporarily in the 2nd Shift ofpermanent school building of KV No.1 AFS, Darbhanga (Bihar).Necessary action for providing permanent school building for this KV can betaken up on transfer of minimum 5.00 acres of suitable piece of land in the name ofKV by the State Government as per norms and availability of adequate funds for thepurpose.(d) The State Government of Bihar has proposed only 4 acres of land at Mauja-Taralahi, Block-Bahadurpur, Darbhanga in place of the minimum requirement of 5.00acres. Hence the proposal has not been accepted by Kendriya VidyalayaSangathan.*****
