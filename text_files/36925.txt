                                                        (a)  & (b)	Under Skill India Mission, the Ministry of Skill Development (MSDE) has been delivering short term skills through Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), and long term skills through Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS) through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), to all sections of the society across all over India including women candidates. Since 2015, a comprehensive Skill India  network has been created viz.PMKVY 1.0, PMKVY 2.0 and PMKVY 3.0 training centres (including Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra) (30,100), Jan Shikshan Sansthans (304), Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) (14722) and through various registered enterprises(1,43,444) under the  NAPS scheme and this network has, so far,  trained more than 351 lakh candidates.In addition, National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) also offers courses under Craftsmen Training Scheme in 33 NSTIs, NSTIs (for both men and women) (14), NSTIs for Women (19) across the country and 2 Extension Centers. Under long term skilling, Directorate General of Training (DGT), MSDE takes care of providing skill training to women in the country which aims at stimulating employment opportunities among women of various socio-economic levels and different age groups. The Government has in place the policy to develop the teaching process in the way of training of trainer’s development programme under Craft Instructor Training Scheme (CITS) and presently conducts the Programme in 16 out of 19 National Skill Training Institutes (Women) are exclusively for women in 16 states / UTs of India. In the year 2020-21, a total 1802 women trainees have been trained in various courses under CITS in these 16 NSTI (W).Vocational trades were identified that were particularly suitable for women and their implementation planned. The identified trades promote women employment in wage-employment in industry, as instructors and also promotes their self-employment. 30% of the seats in General Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) are reserved for women trainees subject to the general reservation policy of the respective State.(c) 	The number of women trained under various MSDE schemes is as below:S.
