Under the Scheme, an amount of Rs. 6000/- per year is transferred in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/- directly into the bank accounts of the farmers. 	The beneficiaries of PM-KISAN Scheme, if they are otherwise eligible, are not debarred to get benefits of any other Scheme implemented by the Union Government or State/UT Governments for the welfare of farmers of the country. (c) & (d):	The PM-KISAN Scheme is a continuous and ongoing Scheme under which the responsibility to identify the beneficiaries and uploading their correct and verified data on PM-KISAN web portal lies with the respective State/UT Governments. The data received on PM-KISAN web portal goes through various level of verification and validation like Aadhaar/PFMS/Income Tax. Consequent upon such verification, the benefits of the Scheme are given to intended beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode directly into their bank accounts. 	 For enrollment under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, the farmer approaches the local patwari / revenue officer / Nodal Officer (PM-KISAN) nominated by the State/UT Government. However, the following additional steps have also been taken by the Government to include more and more eligible farmers under the Scheme.(i)	The States are advised to organize awareness campaigns and registration camps to bring the eligible beneficiaries into the ambit of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme.  (ii)	A special feature, viz “Farmers Corner” is available in the PM-KISAN portal, through which the farmers can also exercise their self-registration. (iii)	Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar database/ card through the Farmers Corner in the portal. (iv) 	Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner in the portal. Village-wise details of beneficiaries are also available on the Farmers Corner. (v)	Farmers can approach Village Level Entrepreneur (VLEs) of CSCs to get enrolled themselves under PM-KISAN Scheme. The facilities available at Farmers Corner can also be availed through VLEs of CSC. (vi)	Mobile app has been launched which also provides the facilities available at Farmers Corner on PM-KISAN portal. *****
