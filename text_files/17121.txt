ANSWER




                                                        (a)Yes, Sir. Government of India launched Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for Middle Income Group (CLSS for MIG)under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) with effect from 01.01.2017 to provide interest subsidy for housing loans to eligible beneficiaries belonging to Middle Income Group (MIG). CLSS for MIG has since been extended annually. Recently the scheme has been extended upto 31.03.2021.The Scheme covers two income segments in the MIG viz. annual household income between Rs.6,00,001 to Rs.12,00,000 (MIG-I) and annual household income between Rs.12,00,001 to Rs.18,00,000 (MIG-II). The interest subsidy under the scheme is available to beneficiaries of MIG-I and MIG-II categories for loan amounts up to Rs.9,00,000/- and 12,00,000/- and the interest subsidy is at the rate of 4% and 3%, respectively.(b) State/ UT wise details of CLSS beneficiaries as per Income Group category are at Annexure.(c) No, Sir.  In order to spread awareness, meetings and workshops are regularly held at City, State and Regional levels to explain the salient features of the PMAY (U) Mission including CLSS component. The Project Management Unit set up under the Mission and senior officers visit States/UTs to interact with the various stakeholders. To publicize the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) component of the mission, radio spots have been broadcast in twelve languages, including Hindi. Also, Social media and the medium of street plays have been used effectively to engage with the stakeholders. Further, workshops are regularly being held by the Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) identified for operationalizing CLSS, to spread awareness among Banks, Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and other Primary Lending Institutions (PLIs) on CLSS. The progress of the scheme is reviewed in the State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) meetings. A web portal named as CLSS Awas Portal (CLAP) has been launched which enables the beneficiaries to track their application status, facilitates timely release of subsidy and also provides various information about the scheme.                                           *****
