ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (c): The overall socio-economic development of the tribal population along with preservation and promotion of traditional tribal cultural heritage is being done through different schematic interventions of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, other Ministriesof Government of India and States Governments. This includes the Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) strategy. This is a multi-pronged strategy which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, livelihood, etc. Data pertaining to decennial census, large scale sample surveys conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and various other surveys conducted by different Ministries/ Departments of Government of India, reveal that there have been considerable improvements in socio economic conditions of the Scheduled Tribes, for example, the percentage of STs Below Poverty Line(BPL) in rural areas has improved from 47.4 % in 2009-10 to 45.3 % in 2011-12, literacy rate for STs has improved from 47.1% in 2001 to 59% in 2011, Infant Mortality Rate has declined from 62.1 (2005-06) to 44.4 (2015-16) and Institutional Delivery improved from 17.7% (2005-06) to 68.0% (2015-16).  However, there are still gaps as compared to figures of total population, as shown in the Table given below:Indicators	Total population	Scheduled TribesRural BPL(2011-12) (Tendulkar Method)	25.7%	45.3%Literacy Rate: Census 2011	73.0%	59.0%Infant Mortality Rate (number of infant deaths per 1000 live births during the year): National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16	40.7	44.4Details of various schemes/ programmes being implemented by the Government for the socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs) are given at Annexure I . Funds released under various schemes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, State/UT-wise, during the last five are given in Annexure II.The interventions under the most of the schemes / programmes of the Ministry are demand driven and funds are provided to State Governments/UT Administrations based upon proposals received from the State Governments/UT Administrations and after appraisal and approval by a Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry.(d):Schemes/programmes of Ministry of Tribal Affairs which have been already modified/merged include subsuming the intervention of “Establishment of Ashram Schools in tribal Sub plan Area”, “Hostel for ST Boys and Girls” and “Vocational Training Centres in Tribal Areas” under the Schemes of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution from 2018-19 onwards and intervention of “Strengthening of Education among ST girls in low literacy Districts” is also rationalised and covered under “Grants in Aid to Voluntary Organisation working for welfare of STs scheme”. However, there is no proposal to close or merge any other schemes(e): Ministry of Tribal Affairs has taken various steps for monitoring progress of implementation of schemes / programmes for the development of the ST population. These include:- •	The primary responsibility of monitoring and control over the performance of the schemes / programmes is that of the State Governments. However, meetings / conferences are convened at the Central level with State officials for ensuring timely submission of proposals, speeding up of implementation of the schemes / programmes, and reviewing the physical and financial progress. Officers while visiting States / UTs also ascertain the progress of implementation of various schemes / programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.•	Utilization Certificates are insisted upon as a pre-requisite for further release of funds.•	Progress reports regarding the status of implementation of schemes are obtained.•	For monitoring of Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) funds of Central Ministries based on the framework and mechanism designed by NITI Aayog, an online monitoring system has been put in place with web address https://stcmis.gov.in/. The framework envisages monitoring of allocations for welfare of STs under the schemes, monitoring of expenditure vis-à-vis allocations, monitoring of physical performance and outcome monitoring. The framework also envisages to capture location wise details to ensure accountability and targeted spending. Further, nodal officer has been nominated in the line Ministries / Departments for coordination and monitoring. •	Mandatory Annual Inspection of NGO projects by District Authorities.Annexure I referred to in reply to part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 4617 for 22.07.2019 regarding ‘Socio-economic Condition of Tribes’Schemes/programmes being implemented by Ministry of Tribal Affairs (I)	Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS): It is a 100% grant from Government of India.

These groups are among the most vulnerable sections of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support.  75 such groups in 18 States and one UT have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

Then this comprised of two different sub-schemes viz., (i) Grant-in-Aid to STDCCs for MFP Operations, and (ii) Market Development of Tribal Products/Produce.  It was reviewed during the year 2013-14.  Based on independent evaluation of the performance of both the sub-schemes and keeping in view the basic objectives of the two and the need for more focused interventions, the sub-schemes were merged into a single Central Sector Scheme titled “Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce” for the remaining period of the 12th Five Year Plan.  The revised scheme focuses on socio-economic security of the tribal population through market intervention, skill up-gradation and infrastructural support.
