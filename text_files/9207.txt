                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country, including Andhra Pradesh. A proposal was received from the State Government of Andhra Pradesh for establishing Andhra Pradesh (AP) Fibre Grid, which inter alia includes connectivity from Mandal to Gram Panchayats, with support from Universal Service Obligation Funds/Department of Telecommunications. However, with the approval of the Telecom Commission, the Phase-I of BharatNet in the State has been implemented by Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL).   Subsequently, a modified strategy was approved by the Union Cabinet on 19.07.2017 for implementation of BharatNet project. The modified strategy also includes the State-led model for implementation of BharatNet Phase-II. Accordingly, based on the Detailed Project Report (DPR) submitted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, the Telecom Commission (now known as Digital Communications Commission) has approved the implementation of BharatNet Phase-II under State-led Model in the State including the Gram Panchayats (GPs) in Amravati and other cities/towns.(b) to (d)	Under Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas (Phase-II) project, mobile connectivity, by using 2G + 4G technology, is to be provided in inhabited and uncovered villages at 346 tower locations (identified by Ministry of Home Affairs, in the LWE affected areas) in Andhra Pradesh and a tender for the same has been floated.In Andhra Pradesh, the estimated cost of the BharatNet Phase-II is Rs. 1162.17 crore and the revenue received during the tenure of 3 years will be deducted. The funds for the project are released to the State as a whole and not District/Area-wise. As of now, Rs. 227.12 crore has been released to the State and the balance funds are to be released, as per the terms & conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the State Government.Under BharatNet Phase-II in the State, as on 22.11.2019, by laying 12,933 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC), a total of 2,526 GPs have been connected. The BharatNet project is under implementation in Andhra Pradesh State and the project is targeted to be completed by March 2020.(e) & (f)	As per the approval of the Union Cabinet, BharatNet project is being implemented with the objective to create network infrastructure for providing Broadband connectivity at all GPs. Accordingly, linking of BharatNet Project with AP Fibre Grid Project, with funding from Department of Telecommunications/Universal Service Obligation Funds, is not presently under consideration. ************
