(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) is a Central Sector Scheme. The Scheme aims at providing financial assistance to landholding farmer families across the country, subject to certain exclusion criteria, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs.  Under the Scheme, an amount of Rs. 6000/- per year is transferred in three       4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/- directly into the bank accounts of the farmers. Under the Scheme, the responsibility of identifying the beneficiaries and uploading their correct and verified data on PM-KISAN portal lies with the respective State/UT Government. After the validation of data received from States/UTs through Aadhar/PFMS/Income Tax database, benefits are transferred to the eligible beneficiaries.

(RWBCIS) from Kharif 2016. The scheme aims at supporting the sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to help in stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming. Comprehensive risk insurance to farmers is provided against non-preventable natural calamities such as drought, dry-spells, flood, hailstorm, inundation etc. under the scheme from pre-sowing to post-harvest losses.*****
