                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	&(b): To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, the Ministry of Rural Development has restructured the erstwhile Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) into Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016. The identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-G is based on the housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 database subject to due verification by Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process. The data of 4.04 crore households was derived from the SECC 2011 database and auto generated priority lists were sent to the States/UTs for conducting Gram Sabha verification and Appellate Process. After filtration of ineligible households by Gram Sabha and due appellate process, 2.95 crore households were found eligible for providing assistance under PMAY-G. According to this target of 2.95 crore houses was set under PMAY-G with 1 crore houses taken up during Phase-I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and remaining 1.95 crore houses taken up during Phase-II (2019-20 to 2021-22). The States/UTs through Gram Sabha verification have removed ineligible households from the SECC 2011 database based on the 13 point exclusion criteria of the SECC, the households who already got their houses constructed and other reasons which are specified in the Gram Sabha resolution before the names are removed. As on 14.07.2021, after screening of the ineligible households by the States/UTs, 2.11 crore households are featuring as eligible under PMAY-G from SECC 2011 database and are included in the Permanent Wait List (PWL).(c): Some of the major reasons for non-inclusion or deletion of the names of households by the Gram Sabha from the Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G are given as under:i.	13 point exclusion criteria of SECC 2011ii.	Already has pucca house/availed under other schemeiii.	Beneficiary died with no nominee in SECC listiv.	Beneficiary migrated permanentlyv.	Beneficiary unwilling to construct housevi.	Beneficiary not-traceablevii.	Beneficiary living in sensitive areas/forest areas and not willing to construct house on allocated land. viii.	Switched from rural area to urban area/planning area(d):  There is a well-defined system of removal of ineligible beneficiaries from the Permanent Wait List of the States/UTs using remand module. In the process of remand, Block level official on the basis of uploaded inspection report and Gram Sabha resolution proposes remand of such ineligible beneficiaries. The list of remand is accepted/ rejected by district officials on validation of the documents uploaded. ******
