MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI) (a)Ministry of Minority Affairs launched Upgrading the Skills and Training in Traditional Arts/ Crafts for Development (USTTAD) scheme on 14th May, 2015 to preserve the rich heritage of traditional arts/crafts of minorities. The training component of the scheme was started from 2016-17. Hunar Haat is being implemented from 2016-17 as a component of USTTAD scheme.  The Hunar Haat is an effective platform wherein opportunity is given to artisans/craftsmen and culinary experts from across the country to showcase and market their handmade, rare, exquisite indigenous products. The details of the Scheme Guidelines are also available in public domain on the USTTAD Scheme Portal, i.e., usttad.minorityaffairs.gov.in/.   While no separate funds are allocated for Hunar Haat component, the funds allocated under USTTAD scheme and total funds spent, funds spent under training component and funds spent under Hunar Haat component of USTTAD scheme since 2016-17 are as given below:					            (Rs.
