                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d) Certain myths/misinformation have been reported regarding COVID-19 vaccination drive, including infertility in men and women. These have been promptly addressed by the Central Government. However, the National COVID-19 Vaccination Drive is progressing at a steady pace and COVID vaccination has improved significantly from 2.35 lakh doses average per day in the month of January 2021 to an average of 39.89 lakh doses per day in the month of June 2021.  In order to raise awareness about safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to address vaccine hesitancy and sustain vaccine confidence, a communication strategy is in place which is being implemented across all States/UTs. Some key interventions as part of communication strategy include FAQs for general public and healthcare & frontline workers which have been developed & uploaded on MoHFW website (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/FAQsforHCWs&FLWs.pdf); media channels, radio jockeys, producers etc. have been oriented on correct information regarding COVID-19 vaccination; op-eds and articles by identified experts published to build vaccine confidence; dissemination of fact check videos by key experts to provide correct & factual information. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has advised States/UTs to disseminate clear, consistent, transparent and factual information to general public to clear misconceptions and sustain vaccine confidence.
