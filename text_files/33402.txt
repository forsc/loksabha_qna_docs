This will involve the following important measures:•	All legacy dumpsites remediated and converted into green zones;•	All households and premises segregate their waste into “wet waste” (from kitchen and gardens) and “dry waste” (including paper, glass, plastic, and domestic hazardous waste and sanitary waste wrapped separately);•	100% door to door collection of segregated waste from each household/ premise;•	100% scientific management of all fractions of waste, including safe disposal in scientific wayA total financial allocation of Rs. 1,41,678 crores over a period of 5 years from 2021-2026 has been made under Urban Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, with a focus on source segregation of garbage, reduction in single-use plastic, reduction in air pollution by effectively managing waste from construction-and-demolition activities and bio-remediation of all legacy waste dump sites.(b) A Standing Committee on Technology for Waste Management for assessment of indigenous technologies and innovative waste management practices is under CPCB. A proposal for solid waste management through pyrolysis technology has been received from Andhra Pradesh.*****
