ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) The Government has not received any formal communication from the ILO inthis regard. The RTE Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down the Pupil-TeacherRatio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools. At the primary level,PTR norm is 30:1 and at the upper primary level it is 35:1. As per the UnifiedDistrict Information System for Education (UDISE) 2016-17, the PTR atnational level for primary schools is 23:1 and upper primary schools is 24:1,which is better than the prescribed norms.(b) & (c) The data available at the ILOSTAT website has shown that Finland didnot fall within top 20 on the basis of number of teachers per 1000 under-15children, it was at the twenty-first position.*******
