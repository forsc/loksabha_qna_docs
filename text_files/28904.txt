ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a)	As per information received from National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), details of cases (States/UT wise) registered in respect of deaths in police custody during the year 2021 up to 15.11.2021 is given at Annexure. (b) to (d) 	As per the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India, Police and Public order are State subjects. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Government  concerned  to appropriately  prevent  and  ensure  non-occurrence --2--LS.US.Q.NO. 397 FOR 30.11.2021of police atrocities and protect the human rights of the citizens.  Custodial deaths/violation involve the State Police and jail authorities which also falls within the jurisdiction of the State Governments.  In view of this, the Central Government does not intervene directly in the matters of custodial deaths.  The Central Government has issued advisories, and the NHRC has issued guidelines and recommendations to be followed by the States/UTs in all cases of custodial deaths.  In addition, workshops/seminars are also organized by NHRC from time to time to sensitize officers in State Governments for better protection of human rights and particularly protection of rights of persons in custody.******
