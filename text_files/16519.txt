                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): 	The State Government is primarily responsible for managing and undertaking necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities including drought and cyclone. Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments with financial assistance.  In the eventuality of notified calamities, State Governments are empowered to undertake necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), which is readily available with the State. For calamity of severe nature, additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), in accordance with items and norms of assistance, upon receipt of Memorandum from the State Government. Thereafter, Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) is constituted. IMCT visits the State for assessment of the calamity situation and requirement of financial assistance from NDRF. Taking into account the recommendations of the IMCT and the recommendations of the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) thereon, the Government of India approves assistance from NDRF.Contd…..2/- - 2-(b):	Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme (ADWDRS) was announced in the Union Budget 2008-09. Under the ADWDR scheme, all direct agricultural loans disbursed to farmers between 31.3.1997 and 31.3.2007, overdue as on 31.12.2007 and remained unpaid until 29.2.2008, were covered under the scheme. Full debt waiver of the eligible amount was given to ‘small and marginal farmers’ and one-time settlement rebate of 25% was extended to other farmers’ against the payment of balance 75% in not more than three installments. The debt waiver portion of the ADWDRS, 2008 was closed by its due date i.e. 30.6.2008, while the debt relief portion of the scheme was extended till 31.12.2009 and further upto 30.6.2010. Under the scheme, 3.73 crore farmers of different States were benefitted to the extent of Rs.52,259.86 crore. After the closure of ADWDR, 2008, no other waiver scheme has been implemented by the Union Government.(c):	In order to help farmers, Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016. These schemes provide insurance cover to farmers against suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities and adverse weather incidence. It also helps to stabilize the income of farmers.    The scheme is optional for the States/ Union Territories.  The State Government of Odisha is implementing the scheme since its inception.******
