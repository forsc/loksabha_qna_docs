The GST rates on goods and services were initially fitted into different rate slabs by the GST Council on the basis of pre-GST incidence of taxes on them. Subsequently, the rates have been reviewed by the Council taking into account the requests received from stakeholders and based on the recommendations of the Council, rates have been rationalized for a large number of items.(c) and (d): The GST rate structure for the textile sector was discussed in detail in the GST Council meeting held on 3rd June, 2017, wherein the Council recommended the detailed rate structure for the textile sector. Accordingly, the GST rates for the handloom sector are as follows:? Khadi yarn attracts nil GST.? Amber charkha and weaving machinery [Handlooms] attract nil GST.? Khadi fabric, sold through Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) and KVIC certified institutions/outlets attracts Nil GST.? All types of fabrics including handloom fabrics attract 5% GST.(e) and (f): Several measures have been taken in GST to eliminate hardships to MSME. Some of the measures taken are as under:-? Initially the threshold exemption upto Rs. 20 lacs was prescribed, which has been raised to Rs. 40 lacs for goods.? Composition scheme has been prescribed for goods upto Rs. 1.5 crores a year and Rs 50 lacs a year for services.? Composition dealers are required to file annual returns and make quarterly payments.? Other small taxpayers having turnover less than Rs. 5 crores per year are required to file quarterly returns.******
