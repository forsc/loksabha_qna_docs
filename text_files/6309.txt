                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)	Data on production of crude steel during last five years i.e 2014-15 to 2018-19 along with percentage change is given below:-India: crude steel (million tones or mt)Year	Production	% change over last year2014-15	88.98	--2015-16	89.79	0.92016-17	97.94	9.12017-18	103.13	5.32018-19	110.92	7.6Source: JPC(b)&(c): Yes, Sir.  Decline was registered during FY 2014-15, FY 2015-16 and FY 2018-19. However, export of total finished steel (non-alloy + alloy/stainless) registered a growth during FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18. The data on overall export of total finished (non-alloy + alloy/stainless) steel during the last five years i.e FY. 2014-15 to FY 2018-19 is given below:-Total Finished Steel (alloy/stainless + non-alloy) Export (mt)Year	Qty	% change over last year2014-15	5.59	-6.52015-16	4.08	-27.12016-17	8.24	102.12017-18	9.62	16.72018-19	6.36	-33.9Source: JPCContd……………2/--: 2 :-(d)&(e): Steel is a de-regulated sector. Government’s role is that of a facilitator which lays down policy guidelines and establishes the institutional mechanism/structure for creating conducive environment for improving efficiency and performance of the steel sector. (f)	No, Sir.  The Government has accorded “in principle” approval for strategic disinvestment of only three units of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) viz. Visveswaraya Iron & Steel Plant (VISP), Bhadravati, Karnataka, Salem Steel Plant (SSP), Tamil Nadu and Alloy Steels Plant (ASP), Durgapur, West Bengal. These three units of SAIL have been consistently making losses. These three units are to be disinvested through a set of modalities prescribed by the guidelines issued by DIPAM.********
