                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c):Public Health and Hospitals being a State Subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening public healthcare system including ensuring availability of doctors and other human resources for health in public healthcare facilities lies with the respective State Governments including Uttar Pradesh. However, to address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Health Mission (NHM) supplements the efforts of the State/UT governments including Uttar Pradesh to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities all over the country, including ensuring availability of doctors and other human resources. This support is provided based on the proposals received from the State Governments in their annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.NHM support is provided to States/ UTs for setting up of new facilities as per norms and upgradation of existing facilities for bridging the infrastructure gaps and to fill up the vacancies of Human Resources on contractual basis based on the requirement posed by them.Further, under NHM, flexibility is given to the States for providing hard area allowance, performance-based incentives, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc to engage human resources to address the issue of shortage of doctors and specialists in the public health facilities.The States are also encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging doctors and specialists for public healthcare facilities. These include ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services and engaging specialists from outside the government system for service delivery at public facilities under NHM.States have also been allowed to offer negotiable salaries to attract doctors and Specialists including flexibility in strategies such as ''''You quote, we pay".States/UTs are being pursued to take necessary steps, including adopting above strategies, to fill up the vacancies in Human Resources for Health under regular cadre and contractual positions.
