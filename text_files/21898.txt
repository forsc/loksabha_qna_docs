ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.              At present 5 Kendriya Vidyalayas are functioning in permanent school buildings constructed by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) in the Union Territory (UT) of Chandigarh viz. (i) Sector-47 (ii) Sector-31 (iii) Air Force Station High Ground (iv) 3 Base Repair Depot and (v) Ordnance Cable Factory.  Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that it has not received any proposal, so far, from the UT administration of Chandigarh for opening of new KV in Chandigarh. *****
