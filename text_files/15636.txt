ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :	US (Energy Information Administration) is a US Government agency, and specific information regarding their statistical analysis of Indian energy sector is not available. However, as per information available from International Energy Agency (IEA), the transmission and distribution (T&D) losses for calendar year 2016 in United States (US) was 5.81% while the world average was 8.64%. As per information made available by UDAY States, the Aggregate Technical &Commercial (AT&C) losses of the Distribution Utilities in India in the year 2018-19 was 18.19%.(c) :		Electricity is a concurrent subject and distribution of electricity falls under the purview of the respective State Government / State Power Utility. It is the responsibility of distribution licensees to take necessary steps for reducing the AT&C losses in their system.  However, Government of India is assisting states/ utilities to achieve this objective under various schemes, which include Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), to enable States to improve their Distribution infrastructure and systems so that AT&C losses are reduced. Under IPDS/DDUGJY, technical loss reduction measures such as creation /augmentation of sub-transmission & distribution infrastructure; metering of distribution transformers/feeders/ consumers; underground (UG) cabling; aerial bunched (AB) cables; and, IT enablement of distribution infrastructure have been envisaged.****************
