ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c):Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) are operational at public health facilities to exclusively cater the under-five sick SAM children who are admitted for clinical management of their medical complications along with nutritional management. However, SAM children without medical complications do not require admission in NRCs and they can be managed in the community setting. MoHFW has issued guidance notes time to time to all the States and UTs and organized webinars to understand the status of implementation of NRC programme and to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of NRCs during and post COVID-19 lockdown. The guidance note on "Enabling Delivery of Essential Health Services during the COVID 19 Outbreak" was issued on 14th April 2020 and guidance note on “Provision of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services during & post COVID-19 Pandemic” was further issued on 24th May 2020, for ensuring RMNCAH+N services. It was advised in the guidance note that NRC services in non-containment zone to be continued as per existing national guidelines, and in containment zones, medical management of sick SAM children to be ensured in the nearest NRC/health facility whereas post-discharge follow up to be conducted through tele-consultation.During FY 2019-20, 2.25 lakh SAM children received treatment in 1072 NRCs and in FY 2020-21, 1.04 lakh SAM children received treatment in 1073 NRCs. State wise number of sick SAM children admitted in NRCs during FY 2019-20 & FY 2020-21 are annexed at annexures 1 & 2.(d) to (f):As per “AN ANALYSIS OF DETERMINANTS 2014” published by National Institute of Medical Statistics, appropriate feeding of a young child and preventing illness in a child is critical for reducing undernutrition. These immediate causes are influenced by a number of underlying causes such as access to food, maternal status, child care and hygiene sanitation practices. There is therefore, a complex interplay of various factors: food, quality of food available, feeding practices, mother’s education, availability of maternal and child health services, safe water, sanitation, status of women in the society etc. which influence nutritional status of children.However, as per NFHS-5 (2019- 21) factsheets, the nutrition indicators for children under 5 years have improved as compared to NFHS-4 (2015-16) wherein, stunting has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, wasting has reduced from 21.0% to 19.3% and underweight prevalence has reduced from 35.8% to 32.1%.Government has introduced Mission Poshan 2.0, an integrated nutrition support programme in budget 2021-2022 for all States/UTs. It seeks to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under Poshan Tracker to improve governance. States/UTs have been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi Centres to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. Guidelines were issued for transparency and accountability in delivery of supplementary nutrition and to track nutritional outcomes on 13.01.2021.Further, under the Anganwadi Services of the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, severely malnourished children are provided additional nutrition in the form of food supplement providing 800 Kcal of energy and 20-25 g of protein.
