                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):    The Government conducted the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) of India through the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru in 2016 as per which the prevalence of mental disorders in adults over the age of 18 years is about 10.6%. Prevalence of mental disorders in 12 States where the Survey was conducted is at Annexure. Public health and hospitals is a State subject and setting up of hospitals is primarily within the domain of State Governments.  The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of State Governments.  As per available information, there are 47 Government run mental health hospitals in the country, including 3 Central mental health institutions, viz. National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi and Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, Assam. The District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) component of the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) has been sanctioned for implementation in 655 districts for which support is provided to States/UTs through the National Health Mission.  Facilities made available under DMHP at the Community Health Centre(CHC) and Primary Health Centre(PHC) levels, inter-alia, include outpatient services, assessment, counselling/ psycho-social interventions, continuing care and support to persons with severe mental disorders, drugs, outreach services, ambulance services etc. In addition to above services there is a provision of 10 bedded in-patient facility at the District level. Under the Tertiary care component of NMHP, 25 Centres of Excellence have been sanctioned to increase the intake of students in PG departments in mental health specialities as well as to provide tertiary level treatment facilities.  In addition, the Government has also supported 19 Government medical colleges/institutions to strengthen 47 PG Departments in mental health specialities. With a view to further increase mental healthcare facilities in the country, Department of Psychiatry has been set up in each of the 6 newly established All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and similar provision has been made  in the upcoming new AIIMS. Similarly, many other Central as well as State Government hospitals also have Psychiatry Departments.
