ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): No, Sir.  The Railway Website, http://www.indianrail.gov.in, has a fast response time of less than 1 second for both local and network transaction.  It registers on an average 1.2 crore hits daily.  The site was redesigned in 2017.  The earlier version of 2002 used Common Gateway Interface (CGI) technology while the re-designed website uses Java technology, which is far more advanced. Major improvements have been done in the User Interface of the website for better user experience, such as reduced page size, mobile responsiveness, use of advanced version of ‘Google ReCaptcha’ for identification of genuine user request, faster response time and more than 99% uptime.****
