ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)  :  There is no official estimate of the logistics cost in India. However, Armstrong & Associates Inc., a private firm, in its study has estimated that logistics cost in India is 13% of GDP, which is higher than that observed for most of the developed countries (less than 10%).(b) & (c):  In order to reduce logistics cost, Government has taken a number of policy initiatives involving Rail transport, Road transport, Inland Waterways, Coastal Shipping and Streamlining Regulatory procedures. In order to have an integrated approach to logistics, a separate Division has been created in the Department of Commerce to coordinate various Logistics initiatives of the Government. The draft Logistics Policy envisages an IT enabled geospatial approach to integrate the efforts of various ministries in infrastructure planning and its optimal utilisation’. (d) & (e):  Global Supply chains are complex, dynamic and dependent on multiple factors. It is the continuous endeavour of Government of India to avail the opportunities to increase India’s share in global value chains and remains closely engaged with all trading partners in this regard.*****
