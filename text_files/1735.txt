(SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 141 DUE FOR REPLY ON 2ND JULY, 2019.(a) & (b):   Yes Sir. The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  (c) & (d):	 The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018.  The Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and suggests empowering farmers with “improved market linkages” and enabling “self-sustainable models” as the basis for continued productivity-production and income growth for farmers. This builds the basic strategy direction for five primary concerns: optimal monetisation of farmers’ produce, sustainability of production, improved resource use efficiency, re-strengthening of extension and knowledge based services and risk management. The Committee recommended reorienting the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centeredness which goes beyond achieving merely the targeted production and focused on seven major sources of growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.  Various recommendations inter-alia viz., for Agricultural Market Reforms, Price Support System to farmers, reducing input cost for farming, health of the soil, Irrigation management, risk management with respect to crop loss, Improvement in institutional credit system, Drought Management and secondary Agriculture alongwith Governance and structural reforms have been made by the DFI Committee.   	The Government has constituted an Empowered Body for implementation and monitoring of the recommendations of the DFI Committee. (e):	Various initiatives already been rolled out are placed at Annexure.
