Modernization of police force is a continuous and ongoing process. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State Subject as per schedule VII to the constitution of India. However, to supplement the efforts of the States for equipping and modernizing of their police forces, under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’ {erstwhile scheme of Modernisation of Police Force (MPF)}, the States have  been  provided central assistance for acquisition of latest weaponry, -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.1559 FOR 11.02.2020training gadgets, advanced communication, police buildings, police housing, mobility, and forensic equipment etc. as per the proposals of the State Governments  in accordance with their strategic priorities and requirements.The Union Government has created an all India digital network –Crime & Criminal Tracking Networking System (CCTNS) in 15152 out of 15985 police stations of the country which has digitised police processes like registering complaints, FIRs, Investigation details, etc. 100% FIRs are being recorded in 14,992 police stations. In addition, the Government has launched Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) which integrates the process of speedy justice by facilitating data-exchange between the courts, police, prosecution, jails and the forensic laboratories. With a view to achieve the objectives of completion of police investigation within two months of filing FIR by police for sexual assaults, Government has facilitated monitoring of timelines in police investigation through the Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences (ITSSO) Portal, using CCTNS data.  ITSSO is available to law enforcement agencies and gives details on pending cases.  The Government has also launched a National Database  of Sexual Offenders (NDSO) for law enforcement officers.  NDSO -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.1559 FOR 11.02.2020allows tracking of repeat and habitual sex offenders as well as initiate preventive measures against sexual offences. A cyber crime portal is also functional.“Police” being a State subject, the States regularly conduct training of police personnel on various issues including gender sensitization and physical fitness. The Centre also issues advisories to the States to strengthen women police welfare measures and ensure their safety and a conducive work environment.**********
