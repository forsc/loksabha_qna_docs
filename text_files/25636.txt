                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (e) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 137 RAISED BY SHRI JANARDAN SINGH SIGRIWAL &  SHRIMATI QUEEN OJA, HON’BLE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 28th JULY 2021 REGARDING DEVELOPMENT WORKS UNDER ASPIRATIONAL DISTRICTS PROGRAMME.(a)	A total of twenty (20) districts have been identified from the States of Bihar (13 districts) and Assam (7 districts) under the Aspirational Districts Programme (“ADP”). List of districts is placed at Annexure-I. (b)	The Aspirational Districts Programme is in the nature of an additionality to the existing development programmes of the Central and the State Governments. Its key strategy is to identify key performance indicators across sectors which are important like Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure and assist the District administration in monitoring the same. The progress of a District across these performance indicators is captured regularly on a web portal called championsofchange.gov.in, which is available in the public domain. Districts are encouraged to identify their strengths and weaknesses, critical gaps and take action accordingly. Measurement of the progress on a monthly basis also results in ranking the districts which further enthuses them with a sense of healthy competition. (c)	As stated above, the main strategy of the programme is to bring convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangements. Therefore, large infusion of additional funds is not envisaged. However, to foster a competitive spirit and address critical gaps, there is a provision of additional allocation through challenge route.  Under this arrangement, every month, districts are assessed on the basis of their monthly progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded ?10 crores and ?5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded ?3 crores each. Under this arrangement, in Bihar, the District Administration of Begusarai, Purnia, Araria, Gaya, Jamui, Aurangabad, Katihar, Sheikhpura and Nawada are implementing 26 projects across Health & Nutrition, Education and Agriculture & Water resources sectors. Similarly, in Assam, the districts of Udalguri, Barpeta, Baksa, Hailakandi, Dhubri and Darrang are implementing 29 projects across Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Basic Infrastructure and Financial Inclusion & Skill Development sectors. These projects are in various stages of implementation. A district-wise list of projects approved for implementation in Bihar and Assam is provided in Annexure II. A district-wise list of additional funds sanctioned through this arrangement has been placed at Annexure III.(d)	& (e) Currently the government does not have any proposal to expand the list of Aspirational              Districts. However, with the success of this template of development, all State Governments             have been requested to take this template to other underdeveloped blocks and districts.*****Annexure – IList of 20 Aspirational Districts in Bihar and AssamS.NO.
