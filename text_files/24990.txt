ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires the cooperation of all nations, including in South Asia, based on the principles of ‘equity’ and ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. Despite having no binding obligation under the UNFCCC, India announced its voluntary goal to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level. India has achieved 24% emissions intensity reduction during the period 2005 to 2016. Under the Paris Agreement, India submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to UNFCCC outlining eight targets for the period 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce GHG emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF), (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. (c) and (d) As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, climate change is impacting ecosystems, human health and agriculture. As per the Report, risks for some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range. Further, safe work activity and worker productivity during the hottest months of the year would be increasingly affected with climate change. India has become a signatory to the ‘Male Declaration’ which requires health sector strengthening to make it climate resilient. The Government has introduced the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) in November 2018. The programme aims to reduce morbidity, mortality, injuries and health vulnerability due to climate variability and extreme weather.  *******
