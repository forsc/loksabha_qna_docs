ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b) No Sir. The Hon’ble Members of Parliament (MPs) have identified 2,043 Gram Panchayats for development under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY)  till 3 March 2021, as per information available on the programme portal (saanjhi.gov.in). The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic and integrated development of the villages. Out of the 77,248 projects planned for SAGY Gram Panchayats, implementation of 48,774 projects has been completed as on 3 March 2021, as per the information available on SAGY website (http://saanjhi.gov.in).The Ministry has documented many success stories from SAGY Gram Panchayats based on inputs shared by the respective State Governments and made them available for public access on the programme website. The third-party evaluation of the Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY has indicated that the components covered under the scheme and the activities proposed were very much relevant in overall development of villages and it succeeded in improving the accessibility to basic amenities/institutions at Gram Panchayat and village levels. In fact, implementation of SAGY is a demonstration of power of convergence of schemes and initiatives in bringing about rural transformation under the leadership and guidance of Hon’ble MPs.*****
