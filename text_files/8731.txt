                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 205  DUE FOR REPLY ON 3RD DECEMBER, 2019.(a) to (e):  	Government has   implemented   the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, an income support scheme for farmers to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. The scheme is for all farmers’ families holding cultivable land, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. The Scheme is effective from 01.12.2018. Initially, when the scheme was launched on 24th February, 2019, it was applicable to only Small and Marginal Farmers holding cultivable land upto 2 hectares.  However, due to the overwhelming response received from the farming community, the ambit of the Scheme was extended w.e.f. 01.06.2019 to cover all land holding farmer families across the country, irrespective of the size of their land holding.Under the Scheme, benefit is provided to the eligible beneficiary to the tune of Rs.6000/- per year, payable in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000/- each.  The payment is made online directly into the bank accounts of the eligible beneficiaries under Direct Benefit Transfer mode.According to the Scheme, release of benefits under PM-KISAN for the period 1st December, 2019 onwards shall be made to the beneficiaries only on the basis of Aadhar authenticated data, leading to simplification of process of multi-level verification and validation by the concerned agencies thereby enabling speedy payment of benefits to the eligible beneficiaries.      Although the Government has not received any specific representation/request to speed up flow of fund under PM-KISAN Scheme, representations / grievances have been received for    non-registration    under the    scheme, non-payment of    installments, delay in Contd…2/--2-receiving benefits, correction in data, etc. Many procedural changes / interventions / campaigns have been carried out to ensure seamless and fast transfer of benefits to the beneficiaries from time-to-time. Some important procedural changes / interventions / campaigns are enumerated below:(i)	Special identification procedures have been devised for the States of Manipur and Nagaland in view of the community based land ownership in these states. (ii)	Special identification procedure has been devised for the State of Jharkhand which does not have updated land records, as for many decades the mutation of land records on the basis of succession have not been recorded. (iii)	The benefit of the Scheme has also been extended to forest dweller tribals who have been given ‘Pattas’ under the  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. (iv)	For release of 1st Instalment under the scheme pertaining to the 4-monthly period December, 2018 - March, 2019, only possession of Aadhaar number was optional. Aadhaar  seeding  of  the  beneficiaries’  data  was  compulsory  for  release  of  2nd  installment  w.e.f. 1st April, 2019 onwards. Since it was considered to get 100% Aadhaar seeding for release of funds for 2nd installment be difficult, this condition was relaxed and made applicable for release of 3rd installment w.e.f. 1st August, 2019 onwards. However, possession of Aadhaar number was made compulsory for release of 2nd installment pertaining to the 4-monthly period April - July, 2019, except for the States of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K where Aadhar penetration is miniscule. Release of 3rd Instalment onwards w.e.f. 1st August, 2019 was to be made only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded database of all beneficiaries except in respect of the States of Assam,   Meghalaya and J&K  which will remain exempted Contd…3/- -3-from this requirement till 31.3.2020. However, this deadline was further relaxed by the Government till 30th November, 2019. The mandatory requirement of Aadhaar seeding of data of beneficiaries will be applicable for release of benefits for the 4-monthly periods w.e.f. 1st December, 2019 onwards.(v)	 All land holding farmer families who are Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in terms of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 have been excluded from the benefit under the Scheme.(vi)	The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme and also to undertake correction of names of the beneficiaries as per their Aadhaar data upon payment of fees.  The CSCs also assist the farmers free of cost in knowing the status of their claims.(vii)	An exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ have been provided in the PM-Kisan Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration. As on 29-11-2019, 20,89,799 beneficiaries have registered themselves using the Farmers’ Corner feature in the PM-KISAN portal.  (viii)	Through Farmers Corner, farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar card through the Farmers Corner. (ix)	Through Farmers Corner, the farmers can also know the status of their payment.(x)	Through Farmers Corner, the farmers can also know the village-wise names of the beneficiaries.(xi)	The State / UT Governments have organized publicity / awareness camps to ensure Aadhar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data. As a result of this, a large number of beneficiaries have been brought under the Scheme and benefits were disbursed to the already registered beneficiaries whose payments were pending for want of correction of data, thereby enabling speedy flow of funds under the Scheme.                                          *******
