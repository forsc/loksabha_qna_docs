                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY) (a) According to the India’s third Biennial Update Report submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in February 2021, the Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector was a net carbon sink and sequestered 307.82 million tonnes of CO2e in 2016.(b) Annual afforestation on an average of 1.79 million hectares has been achieved collectively by the States/UTs through various afforestation and tree planting programs during 2015-16 to 2019-20. Details of the achievements of afforestation/ tree planting are at Annexure. (c) to (e) The Government of India has taken several initiatives towards creating the carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. Financial assistance to States/UTs under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes including, inter alia, National Afforestation Programme, Development of Wildlife Habitat, Project Elephant, Project Tiger and Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme are supporting such efforts. These initiatives also help in conservation of very dense forest and moderately dense forest as well as increase in forest and tree cover. The Government of India is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising of eight Missions, which provides an overarching policy framework for all climate actions in the country. Under NAPCC, National Mission for a Green India (GIM) aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to climate change by means of plantation activities in forest and non-forest areas. GIM was launched in 2015-16 and a total sum of Rs. 492.20 crores has been released to fifteen States and one Union Territory for undertaking afforestation activities over an area of 1,84,161 hectares including restoration of wetlands which contribute to achieving India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)target. India has also committed to achieve land degradation neutrality and restoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. This will help in preserving forests and biodiversity, facilitating conservation of natural resources and improving carbon sinks. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is currently implementing a centrally sponsored scheme ‘National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic ecosystems (NPCA)’ for conservation and management of wetlands and lakes. NPCA aims at holistic conservation and restoration of wetlands and lakes for achieving the desired water quality enhancement and improvement in biodiversity and ecosystems. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is also implementing the National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) since 2014. Further, the 15thFinance Commission has assigned 10% weight to forest and ecology in its horizontal devolution criteria and weights. ***
