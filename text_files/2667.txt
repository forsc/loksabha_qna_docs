                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		Under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, both Central and State Governments are appropriate Governments to fix, review and revise the minimum wages of the workers employed in the scheduled employment under their respective jurisdictions. Rates fixed in the Central sphere are applicable to establishments under the authority of Central Government, railway administration, mines, oil-fields, major port or anyContd..2/-:: 2 ::corporation established by a Central Government. Employment other than the scheduled employment for central Sphere come under the purview of State Government and accordingly State Government wages are applicable in such employments. To address the variation in wages among States/UTs offered to various types of labourers; to have a uniform wage structure and to reduce the disparity in minimum wages across the country; the concept of National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW) as a non-statutory measure was mooted on the basis of the recommendations of the National Commission on Rural Labour (NCRL) in 1991. On the basis of increase in the Consumer Price Index, the Central Government has fixed the National Floor Level Minimum Wages from Rs.160/- to Rs.176/- per day w.e.f. 01.06.2017. The State Governments/UTs are requested to fix and revise minimum wages in scheduled employments not below the NFLMW.(b) to (d): Considering suggestions received from various stakeholders in tripartite consultations, A draft Labour Code on Wages Bill, 2019, has been prepared after amalgamation, simplification and rationalization of the relevant provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; the Payment of Wages Act, 1936; the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965; and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 and circulated for inter-ministerial consultation. The provisions of the Code on Wages Bill, 2019 are at pre-legislative stage.(e):		The erstwhile Common Service Centre (CSC) Scheme has been closed on 31st March, 2017. However, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) is implementing the CSC-2.0: a way forward project at Gram Panchayat (GP) level under Digital India Programme which aimed to set up at least one CSC at GP level to cover all the 2.5 lakhs GPs across the country. The key objective of CSCs is to deliver various citizen centric services, such as, Government to Citizen (G2C), Business to Citizen (B2C) services, financial inclusion services, educational services, skill development services etc. CSC-2.0 project is completely based on a service delivery/transaction oriented self-sustainable entrepreneurship model, with the objective to enable non-discriminatory access to e-Services to citizens, especially in rural areas.******
