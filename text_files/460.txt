                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.  43  DUE FOR REPLY ON 25TH JUNE, 2019.(a) to (e):	The objective of launching the new scheme, an yield based scheme, namely, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and an weather index based “Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS)” from Kharif 2016, is to provide a simple and affordable crop insurance product to ensure comprehensive risk cover for crops of farmers against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest, to provide adequate claim amount and timely settlement of claims.  Crop insurance is a major risk mitigation tool for the benefit of farmers. Insurance is all about spreading the risk over the period and over the area.  As per provisions of the PMFBY/RWBCIS, premium from farmers alongwith Central and State Government share in premium subsidy is paid to the concerned insurance company for acceptance of risk and payment of claims as per provision of scheme.    Insurers save premium in good seasons/years and pay high claims, if any in bad years from the savings made in the good years.Therefore, the scheme is made compulsory for the loanee farmers growing notified crops in notified areas and the scheme is voluntary for non-loanee farmers.  Requests/representations have been received from various quarters including farmer organizations, States etc. to make the scheme voluntary/optional for all farmers.  The revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on suggestions/representations are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.   Contd..2/- -2-Inspite of overall good monsoon during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, the claim ratio during 2016-17 and 2017-18 was about 74% and 83% respectively.    But  the farmers in most affected areas/States received higher claims and the claim ratio was high in these States viz. Kerala 209% and Karnataka-134%, during Kharif 2016,  Tamil Nadu – 286% and Andhra Pradesh 172% during Rabi 2016-17.  Similarly during Kharif 2017, the higher claim ratio was in the States of Chhattisgarh – 451%, Haryana – 269%, Madhya Pradesh – 161% and Odisha – 216%.  During Rabi 2017-18 high claim ratio States were Odisha (226%), Tamil Nadu (122%) and Chhattisgarh (105%).  Though complete data for Kharif 2018 season is not available, high  Claims ratio has been reported  in States of Himachal Pradesh (215%), Haryana (120%), Uttarakhand (115%) and Chhattisgarh (111%)   Hence, it is not correct to say that loanee farmers, for whom the Scheme is mandatory, are  severely affected economically due to less settlement of claims.  State-wise details of claim ratio during 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 (Provisional for Kharif 2018 season only as complete data is not available for Rabi 2018-19) are Annexed.
