ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c). Some studies indicate decreased crop yield due to excessive exposure. However, specific assessment of the quantum of loss of crop yield due to pollution from ozone and black carbon is not available. 	Ozone is a secondary pollutant which is formed through atmospheric reactions and the factors responsible are high temperature and emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) & Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Major sources for NOx include vehicles, power plants and burning of fuel etc. VOCs are emitted from vehicles, petrol pumps, use of solvents and burning of waste.            The Government has taken several measures to control NOx and VOCs emissions which include the following:•	Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi and from by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country which will reduce NOx emissions of heavy duty diesel vehicles by 88.5% in comparison to BS-IV vehicles.•	Installation of vapour recovery systems in petrol pumps.•	Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending. •	Promotion of public transport and improvements in roads and building of more bridges to ease congestion on roads.******
