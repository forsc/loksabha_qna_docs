ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                    (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	& (b) The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) was enacted in March, 2016 to ensure regulation and promotion of Real Estate Sector in an efficient and transparent manner and protect the interest of homebuyers. There are no infirmities in RERA regarding the protection of interests of home buyers.(c)&(d) So far 34 States/UTs have notified rules under RERA. Implementation of RERA in State of Nagaland is under process. However, the State of West Bengal has enacted its own Legislation, i.e. West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 (HIRA) instead of notifying rules under RERA. HIRA has been challenged in Hon’ble Supreme Court by a homebuyer’s association and the matter is sub judice.  (e)  As on 8th February, 2021, 34 States/UTs have notified rules under RERA. 30 States/UTs have set up Real Estate Regulatory Authorities and 26 States/UTs have set up Real Estate Appellate Tribunals.	                                            *****
