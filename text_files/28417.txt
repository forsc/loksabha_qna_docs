ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):  (a)&(c) Yes, Sir. India Russia Inter Governmental Agreement of 2010 facilitates storage and reprocessing of Spent Nuclear Fuel of KKNPP in line with India’s closed fuel cycle policy. India has adopted “closed fuel cycle”, where spent nuclear fuel is regarded as a material of resource. Given the very small quantity of high level waste generated post reprocessing and technologies for separation, partitioning and burning of waste being developed by the country, there is no need of deep underground geological disposal facility in the near future. (b)	The scheme of storage of spent (used) fuel in a nuclear power plant is two-fold.  The first place of storing spent fuel is located within the reactor building/service building, generally known as the spent fuel storage pool/bay and the other is called the ‘Away From Reactor’ (AFR) Spent Fuel Storage Facility, within the plant premises. These facilities are designed with a comprehensive approach to safety to withstand extreme natural events like earthquakes and tsunamis with provisions of large operational safety margins for safe, sound and reliable performance. These are designed to ensure that there would be no adverse impact on plant personnel, general public or the environment. AFRs are also already constructed and functional at other sites like Tarapur, Maharashtra and Rawatbhata, Rajasthan. *****
