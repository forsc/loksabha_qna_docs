ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b):   Government is committed for digital safety of people including women and has taken several steps that inter alia, include:(i)	The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 has   provisions to deal with prevalent cyber crimes including the ones related to women.  Sections 66E, 67, and 67A of the Act provide for the punishment and fine for violation of bodily privacy and publishing or transmitting of obscene/sexually-explicit material in electronic form. Section 67B of the Act specifically provides stringent punishment for publishing, browsing or transmitting child pornography in electronic form. Further, sections 354C and 354D of Indian Penal Code provide punishment for cyber bullying and cyber stalking. (ii)	The recently notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021notified under the IT Act particularly deal with citizen safety especially for women and children. The IT Rules require that the intermediaries shall observe due diligence while discharging their duties and shall inform their users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is harmful, defamatory, obscene and invasive of another’s privacy or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatsoever.  The intermediary shall also adopt grievance mechanism as prescribed in the Rules. Intermediaries are also expected to remove any information violative of any law in India as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by an appropriate government or its authorised agency.Further, rule 3(2) of these Rules provides that on a complaint by an individual intermediary shall, within 24 hours, remove any content which prima facie exposes the private area of such individual, shows such individual in full or partial nudity or shows or depicts such individual in any sexual act or conduct, or is in the nature of impersonation in an electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual.(iii)	Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) operates a National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, www.cybercrime.gov.in to enable citizens to report complaints pertaining to all types of cyber crimes with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. (iv)	MeitY through a program, namely, Information Security Education & Awareness (ISEA), has been creating awareness among users highlighting the importance of following the ethics while using Internet and advising them not to share rumours/fake news. A dedicated website for information security awareness (https://www.infosecawareness.in) provides relevant awareness material. 	Besides conducting training and awareness workshop including those exclusively for women, ISEA has published  an exclusive handbook namely ‘Information Security Awareness handbook for Women’, ‘Cyber Security tips for Women’ and ‘Online Safety tips for Women @ Home during COVID 19’. The awareness content designed/developed exclusively for women have been made available for download on the website https://www.infosecawareness.in/women(c) and (d): With the new IT Rules, it is expected that the adoption of  a robust grievance redressal mechanism and publishing of monthly compliance reports from significant social media intermediaries would improve citizen’s digital safety. (e) and (f):   This Ministry regularly interacts with Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Women and Child Development on issues related to spreading of fake news and misinformation/disinformation on the social media platforms.*******
