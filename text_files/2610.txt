As part of rationalization of schemes of the Ministry, the intervention of Vocational Training Centres is subsumed under the Schemes of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution from 2018-19 onwards.

Although no such vocational centre was supported by MoTA in Maharashtra under the erstwhile VTC Scheme, funds have been provided to the State of Maharashtra for skill development and vocational training of tribal persons under the schemes ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution during last three years as detailed below:Year	Amount (Rs. in lakh)2016-17	1000.002017-18	0.002018-19	779.74Total	1779.74*****
