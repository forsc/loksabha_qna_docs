                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): As per the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) Guidelines, the resource envelope for the development of Gram Panchayats may include resources from fully tied Central/State schemes such as PMAY-G, PMGSY, etc; partially tied schemes that permit flexibility of use such as Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, NRLM, etc; largely untied schemes that permit a great deal of flexibility such as Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), purely untied resources of the Gram Panchayat such as own revenue, resources that can be mobilised locally in cash, kind and labour, and resources from private, voluntary and cooperative sectors such as CSR funds. It is suggested in the Guidelines that the critical gaps in the development plan for the Gram Panchayat may be filled by resources from MPLADS among other measures.  The Govt. has approved the restoration and continuation of Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) during the remaining part of Financial Year 2021-22 and up to Financial Year 2025-26 co-terminus with the period of 15th Finance Commission recently. Further, under the SAGY Framework of Guidelines, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through effective convergence and implementation of existing development schemes of Government under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocation of any additional fund.  (d): The steps taken by the Government for all round development in these villages under the scheme after emergence of new scenario are placed in the annexure.  *******Annexure-I Annexure-I referred in point (d) of reply to Lok Sabha unstarred question No.1482 scheduled for answer on 7th December 2021 The steps taken by the Government for all round development in these villages under the scheme after emergence of new scenario: i.	The National Level Committee meeting headed by the Secretary, Rural Development has been conducted wherein all the 20 members Ministries/Departments have been requested to issue necessary advisories and to advise the State Government to arrange to complete the pending VDP activities that are mapped with their respective schemes/programmes and also to saturate all the major programmes/schemes in the SAGY GPs on priority. ii.	The Ministry has organised capacity building exercises for State Nodal Officers, Charge Officers and other stakeholders through webinars. Around 1000 SAGY functionaries have been trained on participative planning, drafting Village Development Plans, Zero Cost Development, COVID-19 response and alternative livelihoods for rural areas, and hands-on training on the Management Information System of SAGY. iii.	26 Schemes of 17 Ministries of Government of India have been amended / appropriate advisories have been issued to accord priority to SAGY in respective schemes for ensuring convergence iv.	The States/UTs were requested to take up permitted mitigatory activities in the SAGY Gram Panchayats under the leadership of Hon’ble MPs, MLAs and other public representatives while strictly adhering to the lock-down instructions. Also, the leadership qualities of public representatives may be leveraged to raise awareness about social distancing, sanitization, use of Arogya Setu App, development of health facilities etc.v.	To reboot rural economy an advisory has been issued that the Village Development Plans of the SAGY Gram Panchayats, if needed, may be recast in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and its socio-economic fallout. vi.

The website contains detailed information, extensive reports, graphs and maps on the progress of the scheme. Also, the portal is linked with Mission Antyodaya website wherein the status of each of the adopted SAGY Gram Panchayats with respect to infrastructure facility and public service delivery along with ranking and gap is available to aid the SAGY GPs to prepare comprehensive Village Development Plan by using the  information available in the revamped portal for the holistic development of the GPs.  vii.
