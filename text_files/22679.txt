ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		The losses in Distribution sector are measured in the form of Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses. As per the ''Report on Performance of State Power Utilities'' published by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) Ltd. for the year 2018-19, the annual AT&C loss for the country was 22.03 %. State wise details are given at Annexure.  As per calculations, 1% AT&C losses contribute to a value loss of        Rs. 6959 Crore annually at the national level. Our goal is to bring down these losses to less than 15% by year 2025.(b) to (d) :	Transmission Losses are caused by Ohmic losses in transmission elements due to their inherent design. Transmission losses in the country in lnter-State Transmission System (ISTS) are in the range of 2.5%-3%.For further reduction in transmission losses, transmission systems in the country are planned with Extra High Voltage transmission Iines. At present, India has adopted transmission voltage upto 765 kV for AC and +/-800 kV for DC system to reduce transmission losses. Further, energy efficient equipment like transformers, reactors etc. have been installed to maintain ISTS losses at a minimum level.***********
