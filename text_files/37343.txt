ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):   The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is mainly implemented on ‘Area Approach’ basis.   Admissible claims are worked out and paid directly to the insured farmer’s account by the insurance companies based on the yield data, based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs), per unit area, furnished to the concerned insurance company by the concerned State Government and claim calculation formula envisaged in the Operational Guidelines of the scheme subject to receipt of State Government’s requisite share in premium subsidy.   However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses due to cyclone, cyclonic/unseasonal rains & hailstorms are calculated on individual insured farm basis.   These claims are assessed by a joint committee comprising representatives of State Government and concerned insurance company.	The CCEs are being conducted in a very short harvesting window and are labor intensive in most of the States and there is sometimes delay in submission of yield data by some States/UTs to insurance companies for few notified insurance unit areas which results in delay in settlement of admissible claims of farmers.  Keeping this in view Operational Guidelines (OGs) for PMFBY envisage real time transfer of data through CCE Agri App with time and date stamp and use of technology to ensure timely settlement of farmers claims.  Further, different pilot studies with different approaches like use of Remote Sensing Technology (RST) including satellite data, drones based images etc., especially for CCE planning, direct yield estimation at Gram Panchayat level, risk mapping of districts and for dispute/area discrepancy resolution etc. have been initiated through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC) to leverage technology for implementation of PMFBY.   *****
