ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Unserved and underserved airports of Jharkhand namely, Chaibasa, Chakulia, Dhalbhumgarh, Daltonganj, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Dumka, Giridih, Jamshedpur, Sindri and Hazaribagh figure in the tentative list of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) Airports of RCS Document. RCS - UDAN is market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.  Airports Authority of India(AAI), the Implementing Agency, had initiated fourth round of bidding under RCS-UDAN on 03.12.2019. In case, any valid bid is received connecting airports in Jharkhand, same shall be considered as per the provisions of the RCS document. Out of 688 valid awarded routes by the Implementing Agency, 266 routes have been operationalized so far and the percentage thereof comes to 39%. ;Some of the reasons for non operationalization of remaining UDAN routes are:-i) Lack of infrastructure of civil airports due to non-availability of land, delay related to compliance of theregulations by the airport operators, lack of road connectivity to the airports.ii) Non-completion of the process involved in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by the Airlines.The Implementing Agency has disbursed Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Claim of Rs. 666.28 crore to the Selected Airline operators till 2nd March, 2020 from Regional Air Connectivity Fund Trust(RACFT) in respect of RCS Flights operated by them under RCS - UDAN.
