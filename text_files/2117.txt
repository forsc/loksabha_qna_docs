ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	Currently, the operational Space station is International Space Station (ISS) orbiting at an altitude of 400 km. ISS is operated by five space agencies and they are NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), CSA (Canada), JAXA (Japan) and ESA (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom).(b)	Space station is an integral element of human spaceflight programme as they allow sustained human presence in space to carry out meaningful research. India’s plan of space station is a long term plan after successful operationalization of Gaganyaan.(c)	The program is at a very nascent stage.(d)	Foreign collaborations are not yet finalised.(e)	The space station will provide a research platform that cannot be matched on earth. The expected benefits are likely in the areas of human health, telemedicine, vaccine development, material development, disaster relief, efficient farming techniques, food and water conservation, waste management techniques, environmental research and education programmes that inspire the youth. (f)	Yes Sir, Space Station is an extension of Gaganyaan program. Technologies like Human rated version of GSLV Mk-III, orbital module to ferry crew, life support system etc, developed for Gaganyaan will be used for space station program. The space station design will be modular with initial modules weighing approximately 20 tons and will have provision for extended stay for 3 crew members.(g)	As in Gaganyaan programme where more than 650 industries are participating to realize the flight and ground systems, “Make in India” initiative will be a major driver for the success of space station programme in realization of materials, avionics, fabrication, testing as well as integration of flight systems.*****
