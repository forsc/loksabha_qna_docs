ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b) No Sir. (c)	Government has announced new Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy which aims at making newer investment opportunities available for private sector, so as to allow infusion of private capital, technology, innovation and best management practices.  Post-disinvestment growth of PSEs may generate higher economic activities resulting in new job opportunities and growth of the ancillary industries.  The resources unlocked would be used to finance various social sector/ developmental programmes of the Government, which shall benefit the public.  The policy will eliminate unnecessary overlap of PSEs within the same sector and improve economies of scale and reduce wasteful administrative costs.*****
