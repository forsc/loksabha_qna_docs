The Government of India as a part of poverty reduction strategy launched Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) to improve rural connectivity to provide access to economic and social services to rural population. A total of 8,333 Km road length has been constructed under various interventions of PMGSY in the State of Punjab as on 9th December, 2021. In the State of Rajasthan, a total of 71,274 Km road length has been constructed. In Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, 1,012 Km road length has been constructed as on 9th December, 2021. The construction/upgradation of roads under PMGSY in these areas under various interventions/verticals of PMGSY has, among others, led to opening the door for economic opportunities in these areas. Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Schedule I, Para 4(1), IV. Category D, rural infrastructure works permissible such as works related to rural sanitation, Anganwadi toilets either independently or in convergence with schemes of other Government Departments, construction of play fields, construction of pucca internal roads or streets including side drains and culverts within a villages, construction of buildings for Gram Panchayats, cyclone shelters, Anganwadi centres, village haats and crematoria at the village or block level, construction of Food Grain Storage are done.The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 crore Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of "Housing for All''. Under PMAY-G, the beneficiaries are provided unit assistance of Rs. 1.20 lakhs in plain areas and Rs. 1.30 lakhs in difficult areas, IP districts and Hilly areas for construction of house. The scheme is being implemented in all the States and UTs of India except in Chandigarh, Delhi, Puducherry and Telangana (including Punjab and Rajasthan). At present there is no such proposal under consideration to increase the investment.One of the Rural Development schemes under implementation in the State of Rajasthan and Punjab is Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM). SPMRM is a unique programme, designed to deliver catalytic interventions to rural areas experiencing rapid growth. SPMRM is based on the understanding that in rural areas, a cluster of villages showing growth potential and urbanizing characteristics can be treated as an integrated unit leading to opportunities for growth and economic development far beyond that of individual villages. The main objectives of Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) are to stimulate local economic development, enhance basic services, and create well planned Rurban clusters.Under SPMRM, the State of Punjab has total eight Rurban clusters. There is no Rurban cluster in the district Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan. 2.   Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs vide their OM dated 09.12.2021 has stated that SEBI undertakes various investor education and awareness activities to create awareness on relevant issues in securities market and to protect the interests of investors in securities market.

SEBI’s programs are conducted for various sections of society across the country including Punjab and Rajasthan. All the education and awareness programs are free for the participants.  Due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic all the investor awareness programs have been conducted through webinars since March 2020. 3.   In order to increase investor awareness among larger number of people, SEBI also carries out mass media campaign giving relevant messages to investors through popular media (TV/ Radio/Print/bulk SMSs/Digital media/cinema). Recently, a mass media campaign on unsolicited investment tips was conducted during January-March 2021. The campaign was undertaken to caution investors about unsolicited investment tips received through SMS so as to safeguard investors from getting lured into promise of unrealistic returns. The campaign was carried out through TV, Print, Radio and Digital modes including SMS. Considering the increase in number of new investors in the securities market, SEBI has enhanced the investor awareness initiatives along with the Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) targeting new investors. 4.   Further, Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (IEPFA) of this Ministry is mandated to take steps for promotion of Investors’ education, awareness and protection under section 125(3)(b) of Companies Act, 2013.
