ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has also been felt on the tea industry in India including Assam. The decline in tea production in Assam during 2020 is estimated to be at 98.29M.Kgs (13.72%), as compared to 2019. The loss of tea production brought down the oversupply situation in the market, which helped the sector through a rise in average price realization of made tea. The average tea auction price for Assam increased by Rs.46.63 per kg (28.60%) during 2020, over the preceding year. Thus, the decline in production was offset by the significant increase in auction prices. However, production of tea has improved in 2021, with an increase of 21.69 M.Kgs. (32.48%) for the period January 2021 to May 2021 as compared to the corresponding period of 2020.The Government, through the Tea Board, is implementing the “Tea Development & Promotion Scheme” for providing financial assistance to the tea industry in the country. The scheme focuses on increasing productivity, quality, value addition, orthodox tea production, and formation of Self Help Groups &Farmer Producer Organisations.  The Tea Board provided financial assistance of Rs.82.09 Crore to the Assam tea industry from April2020 till June 2021.*******
