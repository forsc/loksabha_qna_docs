ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		As per information provided by mine management to the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) under Ministry of Labour and Employment, the details of the number of mining accidents reported and number of fatalities during the last three years and the current year is as follows:Contd..2/-::  2  ::Year	COAL	NON-COAL	TOTAL	No. of accidents	No. of fatalities	No. of accidents	No. of fatalities	No. of accidents	No. of fatalities2016	67	94	39	50	106	1442017	56	61	46	68	102	1292018	53	66	48	54	101	1202019(till June) 	17	17	7	7	24	24(b) to (d):	Government has made provisions to deal with the safety issues pertaining to fire in coal, metalliferous and oil mines under regulations 134-142 of the Coal Mines Regulations, 2017, regulations 119-123 of the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961 and regulations 97-101 of the Oil Mines Regulations, 2017 respectively. Compliance of the above provisions in mines by the mine owners/ management is checked during regular inspections carried out in mines by officers of DGMS.		In addition to the above provisions, following detail guidelines have been issued by the DGMS for addressing the hazards through risk analysis based “Safety Management System/Plan (SMP)” and for dealing with the emergency situations in mines, which, among others, are also very much relevant for the fire hazard:i.	DGMS(Tech.)(S&T) Circular No. 13 of 2002 titled “Safety Management System – A guideline for implementation”;ii.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 02 of 2011 titled “Safety Management System - Provision for auditing and review”;iii.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 5 of 2016, titled “Integrated approach for development of Safety Management Plan for coal and metalliferous mines”; and iv.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 8 of 2016, titled “Emergency Management Plan for Indian coal and metal mines”.		The proactive approach of “Safety Management System” enables the mine management to address the site specific dangers by pinpointing the actual problem, which is in line with the present international practices. Also, the concept of “Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan” facilitates reduction in the response time to save life and property in case of emergency.(e):		There is no specific scheme in the Ministry of Labour & Employment with regard to security of mines. The responsibilities of establishing safety and security systems in mines lies with mine owner/ management.*******
