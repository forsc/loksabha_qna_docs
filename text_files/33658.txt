ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a) & (b):  ‘Rural Roads’ is a state subject. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention to support enhancement of rural connectivity for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. As per the programme guidelines of PMGSY, maintenance of roads constructed under the programme is the responsibility of the State Governments and all road works are covered by initial five year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. Maintenance funds to service the contract are required to be budgeted by the State Governments and placed at the disposal of the State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) in a separate maintenance account. On expiry of the 5 year post construction maintenance, PMGSY roads are required to be placed under Zonal maintenance contracts consisting of 5 year maintenance including renewal as per maintenance cycle, from time to time, which are also financed by the state governments. There is no provision under PMGSY for repair and re-construction of damaged roads. Thus, all the actions in this regard are to be taken by the state government. ******
