ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)	The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change established the G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment as a focal agency to advance scientific knowledge and to evolve integrated management strategies for conservation of biodiversity and natural resources in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR).The Ministry has also launched the National Mission on Himalayan Studies in 2015-16 as a Central Sector Scheme to support the sustenance and enhancement of the ecological, natural, cultural, and socio-economic capital assets and values of the IHR. Other initiatives of Government include the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) outlining eight National Missions on climate change. Two out of eight missions namely, (i) National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE); and (ii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC) are dedicated to ecological studies under the Department of Science & Technology (DST). (c) and (d)	Government of India through its various organizations is carrying out scientific studies to monitor the changes in Himalayan glaciers. In this regard, Ministry of Earth Sciences through its autonomous centre National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) is undertaking long-term monitoring of representative glaciers in Western Himalayas since 2013. Towards this, a small dedicated team has been established at NCPOR and a high altitude station called Himansh has been established in 2016 at Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh. NCPOR is undertaking a coordinated initiative called Himalayan Cryosphere Observations and Modelling (HiCOM) in collaboration with various academic institutions in the Country. This project aims to understand the glacier behaviour and its hydrological response across the Himalaya.Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has been studying Himalayan Glaciers at different time frames. Changes in area of glaciers for the time period of year 1962 and 2001-05 were mapped for 2630 glaciers. In a recent study 5234 glaciers were monitored by ISRO between the years 2001 and 2017-18 across Himalayan-Karakoram region from Kashmir to Sikkim using satellite data. Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun under DST is also monitoring the health of the glaciers in IHR. The Institute is monitoring Gangotri, Dokriani, Chorabari, Dunagiri-Bangni, Pindari, Kafni glaciers in Uttarakhand and Pensilungpa, Durung Darang, and Prakachik glaciers in Ladakh. Geological Survey of India has also conducted studies on melting of nine glaciers by assessment of mass balance and also monitoring the recession/ advancement of 76 glaciers. *****
