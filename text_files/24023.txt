ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. RCS - UDAN is a market driven mechanism. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.  During 3rd round of bidding,  Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency, awarded Ayodhya to Hindan RCS route to Selected Airline Operator (SAO) under UDAN. SAOs under UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. A team of AAI officials also visited  Ayodhya  Airport  on  13.02.2021  to  assess  the feasibility of  operations and to develop the Airport. AAI has prepared a plan of Rs. 242.14 cr. for the development of Ayodhya Airport. (d): 778 RCS routes have been identified across the country by AAI, the implementing agency under RCS-UDAN. Out of these 778 RCS routes, 325 have been operationalized so far. Details of operationalized RCS routes, state-wise, are attached at Annexure.
