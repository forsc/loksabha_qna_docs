ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a to d):  There is no such proposal before the Government. Setting up of Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and their functioning fall within the domain of the respective State Governments in consultation with the High Courts. However, the 14th Finance Commission had endorsed the proposal of Union of India for setting up of 1800 FTCs during 2015-2020 for dealing with specific cases of  heinous nature, civil cases related to women, children, senior citizens, other vulnerable sections of society and property related cases pending for more than 5 years. The Commission had urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%) for this purpose. As per information made available by High Courts, there are 894 afore-mentioned functional FTCs in the country.
