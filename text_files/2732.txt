                                                    (a) whether the electric fence erected at the line of control at Indo-Pak border is proving ineffective due to non-availability of adequate power supply; and(b) if so, the steps being taken by the Government to ensure uninterrupted power supply for the electric fence?






ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	No, Sir. The electric fence namely the Anti Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS) on the Line of Control (LoC) along Indo-Pak Border has proved to be a potent tool to guard against infiltration.  The electricity requirements for the AIOS are being catered through power grid wherever  available and through generators at other locations to ensure uninterrupted power supply. *****
