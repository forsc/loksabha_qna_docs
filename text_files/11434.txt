                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a): Yes Sir, Government is implementing Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The objective of intervention is to protect theContd….2/--2-growers from making distress sale. In accordance with MIS guidelines, this scheme is implemented at the request of a State / UT. Government which is ready to bear 50 percent of the loss (25 percent in case of North-Eastern States), if any, incurred on its implementation. Details of sanctions accorded under MIS during the last three years and the current year, State-wise are placed at Annexure -I. (b) : 	   With a view to ensure delivery of MSP to the farmers, in October, 2018, Government has launched an umbrella scheme of “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA), by incorporating the erstwhile Price Support Scheme (PSS) with certain modifications and rolling out of new schemes of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS), has been launched. Under PM-AASHA, States / UTs are offered to choose either PSS and PDPS in a given procurement season with respect to particular oilseeds crop for the entire State. Pulses and copra are procured under PSS. Only one scheme i.e. PSS or PDPS may be made operational in one State with respect to one commodity. Further, States have the option to roll out Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in district / selected APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockist for oilseeds. Further, Under PM-AASHA, wheat, paddy and coarse grains are procured under the existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution and cotton and textiles are procured under the existing schemes of Ministry of Textiles. The details of procurement made under PM-AASHA since its inception are placed at Annexure-II, III, IV(A) & (B).(c): 	No Study has been conducted by the Central Government . (d):  In order to provide better marketing facilities for farmers, the Government is implementing National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme for transparent price discovery for remunerative prices for the farmers for their produce through competitive online bidding system. So far, 585 wholesale regulated markets of 16 States and 02 UTs have been integrated with e-NAM platform. Further, Government has formulated and circulated a progressive and facilitative Model Act “The State/ UT Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018” in May, 2018 for its adoption by the States/Union Territories (UTs). Besides, in order to provide better marketing facilities to the farmers, the Government has circulated a new model “The Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017” in April 2017 for its adoption by States/ UTs. In addition to above, Government is promoting Farmer Producers Organisation (FPOs), Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) and Gramin Agriculture Market (GrAMs) to provide better marketing facility to the farmers.(e): 	   Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) was set up with objective to maintain a strategic buffer stock that would discourage hoarding and unscrupulous speculation and to protect consumers by supplying such commodities at reasonable prices through calibrated release of stock. This fund was created for some agri-horticultural commodities viz. Onion, potato and pulses to protect the interests of consumers and not to reduce the distress selling of agricultural crops. These commodities, to the extent possible, are to be procured from farmers/farmer’s association at the time of harvesting and stored for regulated release during lean season to help bring down their prices.(f): 	No, Sir.
