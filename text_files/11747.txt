ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI). (a)to(d)  Linguistic Minorities have not been defined either in the Constitution of India or by the Statute.    The working definition followed by the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities is as follows:-“Linguistic Minorities are group or collectivities  of individuals residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language or script of their own. The language of the minority group need not be one of the twenty two languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. In other words, linguistic minorities at the State level mean any group or groups of people whose mother tongues are different from the principal language of the State, and at the district and taluka/tehsil levels, different from the principal language of the district or taluka/ tehsil concerned.”State/UT authorities provide the Linguistic Minority certificate to the educational institutions.   The details of the Linguistic Profile and Educational  facilities provided by the States/UTs have been  provided in the  52nd Report of the Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities which is available on the website of the Ministry of Minority Affairs i.e.  www.minorityaffairs.gov.in. ***********
