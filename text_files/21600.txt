The details of estimated incidence of cancer cases and mortality of cancer cases in the country State/UT wise during 2014 to 2020 is at Annexure I and Annexure II respectively.  (c)	The State/UT wise approvals for National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) under Non Communicable Disease Control Programme(NCD) during period 2015-16 to 2020-21 is given at Annexure III(d)   	Heath is a State subject and the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer. The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under National Health Mission(NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer the focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral. A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. Oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 682 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.(e) & (f) To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved.  The list of such approved SCIs/TCCCs is at Annexure IV In addition, following Cancer Centres under the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India are operational across the country:i)    Maharashtra	(1)	Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel, Mumbai	(2) Advance Centre for Treatment and Research in Cancer (ACTREC), Kharghar, Navi 	Mumbaiii)    Andhra Pradesh	(1)   Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (HBCH&RC), Visakhapatnamiii)    Uttar Pradesh	(1)	Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH), Varanasi	(2)	Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya (MPMMCC), Varanasiiv)    Punjab	(1)  Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH) Sangrurv)    Assam	(1)	Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati		Further, the Central Govt. hospitals namely AIIMS, New Delhi, PGIMER, Chandigarh, JIPMER, Puducherry, Safdarjung Hospital & VMMC, Dr. RML Hospital and Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital are providing cancer treatment.           Oncology in its various aspects is at the focus in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in this direction. All these will enhance the capacity for treatment of cancer in the country.
