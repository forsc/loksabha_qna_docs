                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities. For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with the State Government in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Under SDRF, the Government of India contributes 90% to Hilly States and 75% to other States. The balance 10% for Hilly and 25% for other States is contributed by the respective State Governments. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government, in accordance with established procedures. The assistance approved under SDRF/NDRF norms is provided in the form of relief. The Government of Uttar Pradesh submitted a memorandum seeking financial assistance under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for hailstorm that struck the State in the month of March 2020 (Rabi 2019-20 Season) seeking financial assistance of Rs.358.57 crore for crop loss, ex-gratia relief to families of deceased persons (human loss), animal loss & damage to houses. In response to the memorandum, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) was constituted, which visited the State for assessment of the damage due to hailstorm and requirement of financial assistance from NDRF. Taking into account the recommendations of the IMCT, the recommendations of the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) thereon and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF)/NDRF norms, the Government of India approved assistance of Rs.285.08 crore from NDRF, subject to the adjustment of 50% of balance available in the SDRF account for the hailstorm of Rabi 2019-20. The Government of Uttar Pradesh was allocated Rs.2578.00 crore (Rs.1933.00 crore as central share & Rs.645.00 crore as state share) under SDRF for 2020-21. The entire central share of SDRF was released to the State.*****
