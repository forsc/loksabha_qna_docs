ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	Yes Sir. In 2013, the Haj quota allocated to India was 1,36,020. In the last five years, the haj quota has increased by 63,980.This year, 2,00,000 pilgrims would be going for Haj. This time 2,00,000 hajis would perform haj without any subsidy. This is a record number in the history of India.(b)	& (c ) Out of the total quota of 2,00,000 pilgrims, a quota of 1,40,000 pilgrims has been allocated to Haj Committee of India (HCoI) and 60,000 pilgrims to Haj Group Organisers (HGOs) earlier known as Private Tour Operators (PTOs). In this 60,000 allocation, quota of 10,000 seats would go to economically weaker section at HCoI rates.(d )The Government of India has adopted a very transparent and 100% digital system and created Haj portals for pilgrims and HGOs.(http://haj.nic.in/pto ; http://indianhajpto.gov.in ) This time, in 18 states, 100% applicants are going for Haj. The quota allocated to HCoI is distributed amongst the States/UTs on the basis of their respective Muslim population, based on the 2011 census figures. The surplus seats generated by underutilized quota of states are utilized for providing 500 seats to Mehram, 2000 seats to state of Jammu & Kashmir as a special measure, full quota to States/Union Territories receiving 500 or less Haj application forms but have not been able to satisfy all of the applicants and for the ladies going for Haj without Mehram. The quota still remaining is further allocated to States/Union Territories in proportion of number of applications received.
