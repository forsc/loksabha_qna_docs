                                                        MINISTER  OF  STATE IN THE  MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT,FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a), (b) and (c) The management of forest and wildlife is primarily the responsibility of concerned States/UTs. Incidences of human-animal  conflicts  have  been reported to the Ministry. However, such reports do not indicate an increasing trend in the cases of human-animal conflicts in the country. Assessments of human-wildlife conflicts indicate that the main causes of human-wildlife conflicts include habitat loss, growth of population of wild animals, changing cropping patterns that attract wild animals to farmlands, movement of wild animals from forests area to human dominated landscapes for food and fodder, movement of human beings to forests for illegal collection of forest produce, habitat degradation due to growth of invasive alien species, etc. Wild animals like elephants being long ranging animals sometimes move to human habitations and farmlands also and cause destruction to standing crops, houses and injuring/ death of human being. As per available reports in the Ministry, nearly 500 human deaths are reported in a year  due  to  elephant attacks while nearly 100 human deaths are reported in a year due to Tiger attacks. Further, nearly 100 elephants die every year due to unnatural causes.The Ministry, in the year 2018, has increased ex-gratia relief under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme in case of depredation by wild animals, which is as follows:S.No	Nature  of  damage  caused by wild animals	Amount of ex-gratia  reliefi.	Death	or	permanent incapacitation	Rs.5.00 lakhsii.	Grievous injury	Rs.2.00 lakhsiii.	Minor injury	Cost of treatment up to Rs.25,000/- per personiv.	Loss of property/crops	State/UT Government may adhere to the cost norms prescribed by them.Further, under the revised guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, States have been given option to consider providing add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals.(d) and (e) Incidences of animal-leopard conflicts are not  collated  by  the  Ministry. Detailed Guidelines have been reiterated  in the Ministry’s letters  F.No.  22- 43/2018-IA.III dated 8.8.2019 and F.No. 6-60/2020 WL Part (1) dated 16.07.2020 regarding requirement of certain developmental projects falling within Eco-sensitive Zones to be considered by the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wild Life.
