ANSWER




MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) & (b): As per extant guidelines, if a halt station is considered un-remunerative or not justified on passenger amenity grounds, it could be closed by Railway Administration. Zonal Railways are empowered to close a halt station (Halt Grade 1 to 3), where average number of passengers is less than 25 per day (out ward) on branch lines and less than 50 per day (out ward) on main lines. Identification and closure of un-remunerative halt stations is a continuous and ongoing process.(c) & (d) : At present, no such halt stations have been identified to be closed down. However, in the year 2020-21, 7 halt stations have been closed in the state of Andhra Pradesh owing to un-remunerative and poor patronage. *****
