ANSWER




                                                        (a)to(c):	The data of unregistered street vendors / hawkers is not maintained by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, provides for survey of street vendors by the town vending committees, the composition of which consists of 40% as street vendors.  As informed by the States/UTs, the total number of street vendors identified so far is 18,25,776. The details are annexed.(d): 	The provisions in the Street Vendors Act, 2014 relating to survey of street vendors, issuing them the Certificate of Vending and Identity Cards, and creation of vending zones in the cities are aimed at regularising the business of street vending. 	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has, on June 01, 2020, launched Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Amta Nirbhar Nidhi Scheme (PM SVANidhi) as part of the Aatma Nirbhar Abhiyan. It aims at facilitating collateral free working capital loans upto Rs 10,000 of 1 year tenure, to about 50 lakh street vendors across the country. It also provides for incentives in the form of interest subsidy @ 7% per annum on regular repayment of loan and cash-back upto Rs. 100 per month on undertaking prescribed digital transactions. Further, on timely or early repayment, the vendors will be eligible for the next cycle of working capital loan with an enhanced limit. For the purpose of scheme administration, an end-to-end solution through an IT platform has been developed in collaboration with Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). The loan processing under the Scheme has commenced on July 02, 2020. PM SVANidhi has been advertised appropriately in various media.                                        ******
