ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a):  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) in the country including in Chhattisgarh with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya. Under the scheme funds are released to States/ Union Territories. The Ministry does not allocate funds directly to Districts of the State.  The MoPR has also been incentivizing best performing Panchayats across the country through awards, including financial incentives ranging from Rs.5-50 lakhs for Panchayats under its Incentivization of Panchayats Scheme in recognition of their good work for improving delivery of services and public goods.     The major rural development schemes of the Ministry of Rural Development like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and the scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) of the Department Drinking Water and Sanitation are implemented at Panchayat level in the country including in the State of Chhatisgarh. (b) & (c):  No case has been reported so far from any State including the State of Chhattisgarh & Maharashtra regarding any irregularity under the Schemes of MoPR. Awards under Incentivization of Panchayats are conferred to the participating Panchayats, based on the recommendation by the concerned States/UTs and final selection by Ministry of Panchayati Raj through a well-defined exhaustive and transparent procedure. Further, the Ministry of Rural Development accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, National Level Monitors (NLMs), Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies. NLMs are deputed to visit the districts periodically, generally twice a year, to monitor and report on various aspects of implementation of all rural development programmes. The Department allows for registering complaint through various forums viz., CPGRAMS, complaints through State/UT helplines, written complaints etc. The complaints received in the Department are forwarded to the concerned State Governments /Union Territory for taking appropriate action including investigation.  State Governments are responsible for the disposal of complaints on irregularities reported in a time bound manner.  Social Audits are also conducted by some Schemes like Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, PMAY-G.  Third-Party evaluation of the Schemes is also carried out regularly and actions, as appropriate, are taken on the findings.*****
