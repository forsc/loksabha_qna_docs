                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) & (b): As per the returns submitted under Mineral Conservation and Development Rules (MCDR) 2017, the production of few minerals viz. Garnet, Kyanite, Lead & Zinc ore, Lead Concentrate, Marl, Phosphorite, Rock salt, Siliceous earth, Silver, Tin Concentrate and Zinc Concentrate has improved during the year 2020-21 as compared to the previous year. The mineral wise production of minerals under MCDR 2017 during 2018-19 to 2020-21 is at Annexure-I. India is among the top producers in the world of key minerals like bauxite, chromite, iron ore and manganese ore. The production of these minerals in the respective top ten countries during the period 2015-2019, as given in World Mineral Production 2015-2019of British Geological Survey, along with growth, contribution to world total (2019) and rank (in 2019) is at Annexure-II. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during 2015-2019 of iron ore production in India was the second highest among the top ten producers. The CAGR of both chromium ore & concentrates and manganese ore in India were higher than the global CAGR.The Government has taken several policy reform measures to enhance production and increase the availability of minerals. The measures, inter-alia, include early auction and operationalization of expired mines; ease of doing business; seamless transfer of all valid rights and approvals; incentivizing for starting of mining operation and dispatch; transfer of mining leases; allowing captive mines to sell up to 50% of the minerals produced; enhancing exploration activities, etc. **** Annexure-IAnnexure-I referred to in reply to LS USQ No. 117 answered on 02.02.2022 regarding ‘MINES PRODUCTION’Production of minerals under MCDR, 2017 during 2018-19 to 2020-21Mineral	Unit	2018-19	2019-20(P)	2020-21(P)Bauxite	t	      2,36,89,619 	      2,18,23,793 	      2,03,68,665 Chromite	t	         39,70,691 	         39,29,260 	         28,63,869 Copper Concentrate	t	           1,43,668 	           1,24,692 	           1,08,719 Copper Ore	t	         41,34,702 	         39,52,418 	         33,77,850 Diamond	crt	              38,437 	              28,816 	              13,917 Fluorite (Graded)	t	                1,079 	                1,315 	                1,052 Garnet	t	           1,23,404 	                   552 	                9,307 Gold Ore	t	           5,65,653 	           5,91,251 	           4,50,611 Gold Primary	kg	                1,664 	                1,724 	                1,126 Graphite	t	              39,030 	              31,991 	              30,168 Iolite	kg	                     73 	                     90 	                     16 Iron Ore	tht	           2,06,495 	           2,46,081 	           2,04,482 Kyanite	t	                4,889 	                3,497 	                4,925 Lead & Zinc Ore	t	      1,37,52,295 	      1,44,79,032 	      1,54,55,343 Lead Concentrate	t	           3,58,369 	           3,51,271 	           3,76,924 Limeshell	t	                7,534 	                4,600 	                      -   Limestone	tht	           3,79,975 	           3,59,331 	           3,49,170 Magnesite	t	           1,46,875 	              97,684 	              78,144 Manganese Ore	t	         28,32,314 	         29,04,372 	         26,88,038 Marl	t	         18,90,308 	         21,09,422 	         22,02,331 Moulding Sand	t	              14,805 	              12,805 	              11,737 Phosphorite	t	         14,21,086 	         14,00,186 	         14,55,627 Rock Salt	t	                     17 	                   130 	                   486 Selenite	t	                2,906 	                2,290 	                   202 Siliceous Earth	t	              80,237 	              13,900 	              18,429 Sillimanite	t	              69,919 	              13,236 	              11,110 Silver	kg	           6,79,386 	           6,09,340 	           7,05,795 Sulphur	t	           8,90,400 	           9,00,942 	           7,37,337 Tin Concentrate	kg	              21,212 	              15,546 	              16,865 Vermiculite	t	                2,992 	                2,774 	                1,260 Wollastonite	t	           1,84,063 	           1,24,757 	           1,03,902 Zinc Concentrate	t	         14,56,804 	         14,46,823 	         15,13,996 Source: MCDR Returns, Indian Bureau of Mines		(P): Provisional;
