ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	and (b) So far, the Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for privatization of only one Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) in the Oil and Gas Sector, i.e., Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The proceeds of privatization of BPCL shall go to exchequer and will be used for social sector development programmes. Post-disinvestment, it is expected that the strategic buyer will bring funds, technology, new management etc. for optimum development of business potential of the BPCL. The growth of the BPCL, post-disinvestment, would be able to generate higher economic activity including growth of the ancillary industries, which will in turn result in higher taxes for the Govt.  This shall contribute to the overall macro-economic growth of the country and help creation of new jobs.   On disinvestment of its equity, Govt. will not have right to receive dividends.  However, government will receive disinvestment proceeds upfront.  (c) and (d) The details of revenue received as dividend, financial year wise and company-wise for last 3 years, is at Annexure.  The other sources of revenue are in the nature of direct and indirect taxes, the incidence of which does not depend on the ownership.(e)  The issue of continuation of subsidized rates for specific petroleum products after disinvestment will be considered before inviting financial bids, taking into consideration the interests of customers of BPCL.*****Annexure-IAnnexure to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3101 for reply on 15-03-2021The details of revenue received as dividend, financial year wise and company-wise for last 3 years  (Rs. in crore)Sl.
