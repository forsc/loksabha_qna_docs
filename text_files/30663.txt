                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d) As on 7th December 2021, as reported by States/UTs, a total of 3,46,48,383 positive cases and 4,73,757 deaths have been reported in India so far. The trajectory of cases in the country has registered a sustained and considerable decline since May 2021.  While children may get infected with COVID-19, it has however been observed that children tend to have lesser severity of disease. Of all the confirmed cases, around 9% confirmed cases of COVID-19 are aged 0-17 years of age. To ensure optimal management of pediatric COVID-19 cases, the following measures have been specifically taken by Union Ministry of Health & FW:•	Guidelines on ‘Operationalization of COVID care services for children and adolescents’ was issued and disseminated to all States/UTs on 14th June 2021. Further, with the intent to protect pediatric age group in current and any future surges of cases, Guidelines for management of COVID-19 in children were also issued on 18th June 2021. The guideline provides guidance on the management of acute presentation of COVID-19 as well as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in children and adolescents found temporally related to COVID-19. •	Training modules for Paediatric essential COVID care services and communication strategy with messaging and information for Paediatric COVID care have been developed and widely circulated. National Expert Group on vaccine administration for Covid (NEGVAC) and National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) are deliberating on the scientific evidence related to vaccination of beneficiaries aged less than 18 years.***
