ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) & (b)    : 	As informed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, The Competition Commission of India (“the Commission”) conducted a “Market Study on E-Commerce in India” in April 2019 with a view to better understand the functioning of e-commerce in India, its implications for markets and competition. The objective was to identify impediments to competition, if any, emerging from e-commerce and ascertain the Commission’s enforcement and advocacy priorities in light of the same.      The study identified issues that may, directly or indirectly, have a bearing on competition, or may hinder realisation of the full pro-competitive potential of e-commerce. These include lack of platform neutrality, unfair platform-to-business contract terms, exclusive contracts between online marketplace platforms and sellers/service providers, platform price parity restrictions and deep discounts.      The Study suggested certain areas for self-regulation by the e-commerce marketplace platforms with a view to reduce information asymmetry and promote competition on the merits. The Commission under its advocacy mandate has urged the e-commerce platforms to put in place self-regulatory measures such as search rankings, collection, use and sharing of data, user review and rating mechanism, revision in contract terms and discount policy for ensuring competition, harnessing efficiency and greater transparency.     The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 have been notified on 23rd July, 2020 under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. These Rules specify duties and liabilities of the e-commerce entities and sellers on market place. *****
