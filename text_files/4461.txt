                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a): The number of pending cases in family courts in the country, State/UT-wise, is as per Annexure.(b)-(c): Setting up of subordinate courts, which includes Family Courts and their functioning, is in the domain of the State Governments and respective High Courts. The role and functions of Family Courts are governed by the Family Courts Act, 1984. Family Courts are set up by the State Governments in consultation with the concerned High Courts from their own resources with a view to promote conciliation and to secure speedy settlement of family disputes.The 14th Finance Commission (FC) has endorsed the proposal of Government of India for setting up of 235 Family Courts at a cost of Rs.541crore in districts without such courts as a component of its Memorandum to the Finance Commission in order to dispose of cases pertaining to family disputes. The 14th FC further urged the State Governments to use the additional fiscal space provided by the Commission in the tax devolution from 32% to 42% to meet such requirements. The Union Government also requested the State Governments to implement the recommendations of the 14th FC including those related to setting up of Family Courts.   ANNEXURESl.
