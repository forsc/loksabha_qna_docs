(b):	Under the PM-KISAN Scheme, the responsibility of identification/registration of intended beneficiaries lies with the respective State/UT Government. And, as and when, the correct and verified data of eligible beneficiaries are received on the PM-KISAN portal from respective State/UT Government and their subsequent validation through Aadhar/PFMS/Income Tax database; the benefits of the Scheme are transferred directly into the account of eligible beneficiaries through DBT mode.In addition, to further facilitate the enrollment of eligible farmers, the facility of self-registration has been provided through “Farmers Corner” of PM-KISAN portal. The eligible farmers can also self-register through PM-KISAN Mobile App, which was launched on 24th February, 2020 on the occasion of 1st anniversary of successful implementation of the scheme. Also, the Common Service Centers (CSCs) have been authorized to register farmers for the Scheme.The target of the Department is to achieve 100% saturation by enrolling every eligible farmer family of the country under the PM-KISAN Scheme. To achieve this the States/UTs have been directed to conduct various saturation drives based on the analysis of enrolments from all over the country done by the Department and organize publicity/awareness camps to bring more and more eligible farmers under the Scheme. Further, weekly video Conferences are conducted with all States/UTs to review and encourage them for faster implementation of the Scheme.*****
