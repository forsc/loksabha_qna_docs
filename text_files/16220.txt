ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) Annual average nominal exchange rate of Indian Rupee vis-à-vis US dollar during 2013-14 to 2018-19 is given in Table 1. Table 1: Annual  average nominal exchange rate (Indian Rupee vis-à-vis US Dollar)2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-1961.1	65.5	67.1	64.5	69.9Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaMonthly average nominal exchange rate of Indian Rupee vis-à-vis US dollar in 2019-20 (upto February 2020) is given in Table 2.Table 2: Monthly  average nominal exchange rate (Indian Rupee vis-à-vis US Dollar)Apr-19	May-19	Jun-19	Jul-19	Aug-19	Sep-19	Oct-19	Nov-19	Dec-19	Jan-20	Feb-2069.4	69.8	69.4	68.8	71.1	71.3	71.0	71.5	71.2	71.3	71.4Source: Reserve Bank of India(b) to (d) As reflected in the Economic Survey 2019-20, the value of Indian currency in the medium to long term decreases with the growing size of current account deficit. The current account deficit of India has increased from USD 26.9 billion in 2014-15 to USD 57.3 billion in 2018-19. Nominal exchange rate is only one of the factors that determines export competitiveness and cost of imports with regard to tradeables. Accordingly, the impact of exchange rate on any sector in the economy cannot be isolated. In the short term, exchange rate is impacted by both supply and demand side shocks such as oil price, outbreak of epidemics, etc.(e) The Reserve Bank of India closely monitors the exchange rate of the rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar and intervenes in the forex market, when required, in order to contain excessive volatility in the value of the currency. *****
