                                                        (a) to (c)	The National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 15th  July, 2015, to provide a strong institutional framework to implement and scale up skill development efforts across the country. The key institutional mechanisms for achieving the objectives of the Mission consists of an Apex Governing Council, a Steering Committee and a Mission Directorate (along with an Executive Committee).  The salient features of the NSDM are as follows:a)	Providing opportunities for quality long and short-term skill trainingb)	Providing pathways for re-skilling and up-skilling  of workers to enable 	them for transition from informal to formal sector employmentc)	Aligning skill training to the needs of the industryd)	Developing a network of instructors/trainers in the skill development 	ecosystem e)	Enabling pathways for transitioning between the vocational training 	system and the formal education system, through a credit transfer 	systemf)	Promoting convergence and co-ordination between skill development 	efforts of all Central Ministries/Departments/States/implementing 	agencies     g)	Maintaining a national database, known as the Labour Market 	Information 	System (LMIS).	Under Skill India Mission, more than 20 central Ministries/Departments are running schemes/programs to impart skill training to the youth through long term and short term training. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is  implementing a flagship scheme known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 2.0) 2016-20 on pan-India basis with a target to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT), Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Special Project (SP) across the country over four years (2016-2020) with an outlay of Rs.12,000 crore. 	The details of fund disbursed across the MSDE schemes are at Annexure I. 	Long term training is provided through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). There are 14494 ITIs with a seating capacity of 33.98 lakh. Vocational Training is a concurrent subject of both Central and State Governments. The development of training schemes at National level, evolution of policy, laying of training standard, norms, framing of syllabi, conducting of examinations, certification, etc. are the responsibilities of the Central Government, whereas Opening of ITIs and  day to day administration including admission in ITIs rests with the respective State Governments / UTs. Accordingly, placement data is also captured by the respective State/UTs.(d) to (e)	 As per National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC’s) Sector Specific reports on Human Resource and Skill Requirements, there would be an incremental requirement of 103.4 million people in the 24 high growth sectors requiring fresh skilling. In addition, there is a need for constant upskilling and re-alignment of existing workforce.   A list of 24 sectors covered is at Annexure II. The industry led body viz the Sector Skill Councils are accordingly developing the Qualification Packs for better employment outcomes. Further, as per the Common Norms guidelines training provider/training centres are to provide minimum 70% placements of the certified candidates to claim 20% of the last instalment.(f)	MSDE, through the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC ), has taken up multiple initiatives to connect with industries for partnership under the Skill India Mission. There are more than 500 training partners participating in the skill initiatives of the NSDC. 37 Sector Skill Councils have been set up as Industry led bodies which help in training need analysis, curriculum development, rolling out of training and assessment and certification. The list of private companies that have taken skill development as part of their CSR initiative is at Annexure III.
