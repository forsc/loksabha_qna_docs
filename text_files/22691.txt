However, data pertaining to loss of property due to electrical accidents is not reported by the State/UT DISCOMs. Further because of Covid-19 pandemic, some power utilities have not reported the electrical accident data pertaining to year 2019-20.……….2.- 2 -In case of 66kV and above voltage system, the failure / loss of equipment due to short circuit does not lead to loss of life in most of the cases.(c) :		All the safety and protection devices are to be provided in the system as per the applicable regulations and technical standards. The requisite protection and safety devices that are commonly used are manufactured in India by various manufacturers in accordance with the relevant Indian/ International standards. Further, improvement in technology is a regular phenomenon and technological development is a continuous process.  Most of the protective devices are manufactured in India.(d) &(e) :	CEA (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations,  2010 provide for disconnection of supply instantly on the occurrence of an earth fault or leakage of current, to prevent the loss of lives. The Regulations mandate that the supply of electricity to every electrical installation other than voltage not exceeding 250 V below 5 KW and those installations of voltage not exceeding 250 V which do not attract provisions of Section 54 of the Act, shall be controlled by an earth leakage protective device so as to disconnect the supply instantly on the occurrence of earth fault or leakage of current.***************
