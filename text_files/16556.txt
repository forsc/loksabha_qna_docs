                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) and (b):	   With a view to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country, the Central Government took various measures, considered essential for the safety of people including migrant workers. From March 21, 2020 onwards, Control Room operations in Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) were expanded by making their functioning 24*7 under the supervision of senior officers of the level of Joint Secretaries along with the representatives of key Central Ministries. These Control Rooms,   inter alia,   attended to the  grievances  of stranded  persons including migrant workers and promptly resolved these grievances relating to food, transport,  shelter, etc. States and Union Territories were also advised to set up control rooms with help lines and to appoint nodal officers.-2-LSUSQ No.327 for 15.09.2020The migration of large number of migrant workers was triggered by panic created by fake news regarding duration of lockdown, and people, especially migrant labourers, were worried about adequate supply of basic necessities like food, drinking water, health services and shelter. However, Central Government was fully conscious of this, and took all necessary measures to ensure that during the period of the  inevitable lockdown, no citizen should be deprived of basic amenities of food, drinking water, medical facilities etc. Central Government allowed the State Governments to use the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) on 28th March itself for making provisions of temporary accommodation, Food, clothing, medical care, etc., to homeless people as well as migrant workers. To augment the funds with the  States, Central Government released an advance Rs.11, 092 crores from the SDRF to the States on 3rd April, 2020.(c)	The details regarding number of migrant workers who died while returning to their home States is not centrally maintained.*****
