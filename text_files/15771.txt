ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Central Water Commission maintains National Register of Large Dam (NRLD), a compilation of the large dams in the country prepared as per information received from the State Government / Authority concerned at http://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/nrld06042019.pdf. Latest edition of NRLD was published in June 2019. As per NRLD-2019, Dams older than 100 years situated in Andhra Pradesh are given at Annexure-1.(b)  The Safety of the dams in India is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments and other organizations that own the dams. Central Water Commission has advised dam owners to submit Disaster Management Plan/Emergency Action Plan of their dams from time to time in National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS) meetings. No EAP has so far been received from Andhra Pradesh.(c)  DRIP (Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project) is a World Bank Loan assistance programme to State Govts facilitated by Central Govt,  ongoing since 2012 and scheduled for closure in June, 2020 at a cost of 3466 crores. During the preparatory phase of the Project, World Bank held Preparation Mission from 12 to 22 November, 2008 and held discussions with officials of Central Water Commission (CWC) and participating States including Andhra Pradesh. Vide Aide Memoire (November 2008) circulated by the Contd...P/2//2//World Bank indicated inclusion of 5 States viz. Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Tamil Nadu as confirmed States for DRIP implementation on the basis of institutional readiness, government interest and commitment. The World Bank Mission considered that the proposals from Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal were not sufficient for inclusion as the number of dams proposed were fewer, or quality and readiness of documentation were not proper. (d)  Selection of dams for inclusion in ongoing DRIP was mainly based on the proposal from the States based on their annual inspection of dams.(e)  Government of Andhra Pradesh has shown willingness to be part of the proposed DRIP Phase – II & III scheme which is still under preparatory stage and formal launch of the same is yet to take place. For the proposed DRIP Phase II & III, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh has submitted 31 dams for rehabilitation at an estimated cost of Rs.776.5 Crores. List of dams proposed by Govt of Andhra Pradesh is enclosed as Annexure II. CWC officers and World Bank officials had a consultative meeting with officials of Government of Andhra Pradesh on 20.07.2019, wherein the preparatory activity required for joining the World Bank funded Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Program (DRIP) along with its timeline was explained. ***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Unstarred Question No. 4236 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 19.03.2020 regarding “Old dams in Andhra Pradesh”.Dams Older than 100 years in Andhra PradeshSL No.	Name of Dam	River	Dam Type	Height (m)	Year of Completion	Maintained By1.
