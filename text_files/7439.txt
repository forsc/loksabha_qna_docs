                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	 The figures reported in the National Health Profile, 2019 is of number of persons diagnosed with cancer, diabetes and hypertension out of number of persons screened at Non Communicable Disease (NCD) clinics under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as reported by States/UTs. Under NPCDCS opportunistic screening for common NCDs (Diabetes, Hypertension and three common cancers- oral, breast and cervix) is done for those visiting NCD clinics at the District and Community Health Centres (CHC) levels. As more and more people visit NCD clinics and get themselves screened, the cases of early detection also increase. This is however not an indicator of overall incidence of cancer, diabetes and hypertension. The estimates of cancer in India are based on National Cancer Registry Program (NCRP) under the Indian Council of Medical Research. As per NCRP data, the number of new cancer cases in the country was 14.51 lakh in 2016 and 15.86 lakh in 2018. According to the ICMR study “India: Health of Nation’s States”, Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) have increased by about 80% for diabetes and 24.2% for high blood pressure from 1990 to 2016. It is estimated that 29.8 million cases of childhood (under 5 years) pneumonia occur every year in the country.(c):	 Health is State subject. The Central Government however supplements the efforts of the State Governments. National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancer, 599 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the programme.  Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under the National Health Mission (NHM) in over 215 districts. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Under NHM support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs. Several measures have been taken to discourage the use of tobacco products, which is one of the key risk factors of Cancer, besides initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles through healthy eating and regular physical activity.To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 18 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved.  Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY).Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, has also been approved. Treatment of various cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this,Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 169 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.In order to address issue of Childhood Pneumonia effective coverage of protective, preventive and treat interventions (PPT interventions) with specific emphasis on exclusive breastfeeding, adequate complementary feeding and Vitamin A supplementation, vaccination against Hib and measles, safe WASH practices are being ensured. In addition to the above initiative, Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV) vaccine has been added to the basket of vaccines in the five high burden states. In order to accelerate action to address childhood pneumonia, Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS) initiative has been launched on 16th November, 2019. The initiative encompasses Revised Childhood Pneumonia Management Guideline, Skill based training and SAANS campaign for greater awareness.
