Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is providing financial assistance to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) for income generating activities and skill development programmes, through schemes like Special Central Assistance to Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCA to SCSP), Assistance to State Scheduled Castes Development Corporations (SCDC), Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes (VCF-SC). Also, Corporations under the Ministry, namely National Scheduled Castes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC) and National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC) promote self- employment and enhance direct and indirect employment generation for these deprived sections.         National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC) works   exclusively for economic development of Scheduled Tribes by providing financial assistance at concessional rates of interest.

Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors and Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities for all sections including the deprived sections of the society.*****
