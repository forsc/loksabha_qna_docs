                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	No, Sir. (b) & (c) 	The Hon’ble Supreme Court in CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 6328 - 6399 OF 2015 [ UNION OF INDIA Vs. ASSOCIATION OF UNIFIED TELECOM SERVICE PROVIDERS OF INDIA ETC.] pronounced its judgment dated 24.10.2019 wherein the appeals filed by the Department of Telecom were upheld and the appeals filed by the Telecom Service Providers were dismissed. The Supreme Court has upheld the definition of the Gross Revenue and Adjusted Gross Revenue as enumerated in the License Agreement.(d)	The Cellular Operators Association of India vide their letter dated 29.10.2019 has sought urgent intervention of the Government to avert such an unprecedented impact on the financial health of their member companies. However, one of the members of the Cellular Operators Association of India i.e. Reliance Jio Infocom  Ltd  has submitted a divergent opinion on the said matter. The Government has decided to provide relief to financially stressed telecom service providers (TSPs) by permitting deferment of spectrum auction payment instalments for the  next  two  years  (2020-21  and 2021-22).************
