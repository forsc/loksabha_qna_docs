MoTA provides funds under the schemes ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’, ‘Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution’ and ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ etc. to the States for welfare of Scheduled Tribes. Receipt of proposals from the States is a continuous process.

As per the latest guidelines, besides Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 40 Central Ministries / Departments have been mandated by NITI Aayog to earmark TSP funds in the range of 4.3 to 17.5 percent of their total Scheme allocation every year for tribal development. Prescribed norm for earmarking of funds under TSP by the obligated Ministries/Departments is given at Annexure III.
