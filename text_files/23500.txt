                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Mahatma Gandhi NREG Scheme is a demand driven wage employment programme which provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. During FY 2020-21, more than 369 crore person-days have been generated as on 18.03.2021 which is approximately 40% more than the employment generated during the same period in FY 2019-20. During FY 2020-21, more than 1.77 crore new job cards have been issued so far which is 154% more than the total number of new job cards issued during FY 2019-20. During the current FY 2020-21, more than 10.98 Crore persons were provided employment so far which is 39% more than the persons provided employment during FY 2019-20 under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. These are the indications of the fact that more and more workers have availed employment under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA owing to the distress arising out on accounts of COVID-19 pandemic across the country.The State/UTs wise details of works completed and ongoing along with expenditure is given at Annexure I(c) & (d) Government has enhanced the financial allocation under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA for financial year 2020-21 from Rs.61,500 crore at BE to Rs.1,11,500 crore at RE and Rs.99,001 crore (as on 18.03.2021) has been released to States/UTs in the current financial year 2020-21. Fund release to the States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work as per the Scheme guidelines. The States/UTs-wise release of fund under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the current financial year 2020-21 (as on 18.03.2021) is given at Annexure II.(e) & (f) The implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is the responsibility of Government of States/UTs. During various review meetings like Mid Term Review, Labour Budget Meetings, Labour Budget Review Meetings and other review meetings Government has emphasized on GIS based planning, strengthening of Social Audit, recruitment of Ombudspersons in all districts, geo-tagging of assets and monitoring of works.The Ministry has initiated an integrated holistic planning of the Gram Panchayats based on watershed development using Geographical Information System (GIS) approach. The Government of India has decided to saturate all Gram Panchayats with GIS plan. So far, GIS plans for 43,592 GPs have been designed.The Central Government, in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG) has notified The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Audit of Schemes Rules, 2011, and the Auditing Standards for Social Audit, to strengthen the process of social audits. Ministry has advised all States / UTs to adopt the Auditing Standards for the functioning of social audit units and conduct social audits in all Gram Panchayats atleast once in every year.The Ministry rolled out Geo-MGNREGA phase I and Phase II for geo-tagging of assets created under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. So far more than 4.33 crore assets have been geo-tagged and made available in the public domain.******* Annexure IAnnexure referred in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.4593 dated 23.03.2021Annexure IIAnnexure referred in reply to parts (c) & (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.4593 dated 23.03.2021
