ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :		Details of power generation from fuel sources (Thermal, Nuclear & Hydro (25 MW & above) in the country during the last five years and current year 2021-22 (up to December 2021) are given at Annexure-I. Source-wise Renewable Energy Generation in the country from the year 2016-17 to 2021-22 (Up to November 2021) is enclosed at Annexure-II. The total power consumption across the country during 2019-20 is 1248085.82 MU.(b) :		There is adequate availability of electricity in the country and electricity generation is commensurate with the energy requirement.  The overall power supply position in the country, is comfortable with only a marginal gap between Energy Requirement and Energy Supplied. Even this gap is generally on account of factors, other than inadequacy of power availability in the country e.g. constraints in distribution network, financial constraints, commercial reasons, outages of generating units etc.The details of actual All India Power Supply Position during the last two years i.e. 2019-20 & 2020-21 and the current year i.e. 2021-22 (period April, 2021 to December, 2021) are given at Annexure-III.As per the information given by States to CEA, the State-wise Energy Power Supply Position for the month of December 2021, is given at Annexure-IV.(c) :		Various steps/measures taken by the Government to encourage/promote use of electric vehicles (EV) in the country are at Annexure-V.(d) :		Under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME-II) scheme, total 177 public EV charging stations have been sanctioned to Delhi NCR region comprising of 72 PCS (Public Charging Station) in Delhi, 55 PCS in NOIDA, 30 PCS in Gurugram, 10 PCS each in Sonipat and Karnal.   Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is the Central Nodal Agency in regard to looking after the maintenance of details of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. (e) :		Public EV charging stations allocated to Delhi NCR under FAME-II scheme are given at Annexure-VI.(f) :		Department of Revenue has informed that the current basic customs duty (BCD) rate structure on import of electric vehicle (EV) components is as per the phased manufacturing programme (PMP) notified by Ministry of Heavy Industries.  This PMP has prescribed a graded import duty structure, wherein parts attract lower import duty as compared to the finished EV.  The PMP seeks to attain higher domestic value addition in the EV sector in a phased manner.  However, as on 31.01.2022 there is no proposal to deviate from the import tariff trajectory set out in the PMP. *************
