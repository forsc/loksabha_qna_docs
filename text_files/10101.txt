                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Government has decided to set up one Rural Self Employment Training Institute [RSETI] in each District of the country. RSETIs are Bank led initiative involving active support of the Government of India and the State Governments.  The Government of India provides one time infrastructure support of Rs. 1 crore besides reimbursing the cost of training rural poor candidates. The State Government provides land free of cost or at nominal charges. The Banks are responsible for day to day functioning of the RSETIs.  The core strength of the RSETI lies in its short term training and long term hand-holding to the rural entrepreneurs for setting up micro enterprises.  Each RSETI is expected to train 750 rural poor youth every year for taking up self employment in the area they reside.  RSETIs also provide periodic skill up gradation training to the entrepreneurs for making their initiatives more viable and sustainable. Apart from RSETIs, the Government is also undertaking a Placement Linked Skill Development Program called DeenDayalUpadhyayaGrameenKaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) for rural poor youth. DDU-GKY is undertaken as PPP Project through Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) registered with the Ministry of Rural Development. PIAs take up skill training of rural poor youth in the training centres established by them. Cost of building / purchase of land etc. is not permitted under DDU-GKY. (c) & (d):	RSETIs are established in the districts of the States/UTs which include backward and rural areas.  The details of total number of RSETIs established (as on date), State/UT-wise is given in Annexure. ***********************                                                                                 Annexure ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN THE ANSWER TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO 3500 FOR ANSWER ON 10.12.2019 Sl.
