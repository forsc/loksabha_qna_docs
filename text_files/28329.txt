THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) & (b): 	The Government has been assessing the performance of production of major commodity groups by monthly indicators, such as, Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI).  Monthly economic review of Ministries/Departments also plays a vital role in providing policy inputs to assess the impact of COVID-19. Pandemic has impacted the world economy including India, causing lower economic growth and disruption in production activities.  Industrial production as measured by IIP has shown strong recovery in the current financial year 2021-22. The performance of major commodity groups and use-based category groups based on Index of Industrial Production for the latest 12 months is provided at Annex I & II respectively.(c) & (d):    	Department of Commerce has been providing details on India’s foreign trade which assesses the trend of exports and imports. Exports from India were impacted due to COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-21. However, after the concerted effort of the government India’s overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in October 2021 are estimated to be USD 56.51Billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 35.16 per cent over the same period last year and a positive growth of 29.13 per cent over October 2019. India’s overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-October 2021 are estimated to be USD 369.39 Billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 39.83 per cent over the same period last year and a positive growth of 19.97 per cent over April-October 2019. Atmanirbhar Bharat mission for economic growth is a vision based on net exports and making India competitive. Government''s focus on new and existing markets and products and simplification of procedures will greatly enhance the competitiveness of Indian exports. In order to leverage India’s full export potential, government is promoting districts as exports hubs by identifying products and services with export potential in each district, addressing bottlenecks for exporting these products/services, and supporting local exporters through institutional and strategic interventions(e): 	Government has taken a number of measures to revive economic growth such as special economic and comprehensive package of Rs. 29.87 lakh crore, 34.5 percent increase in capital expenditure in Union Budget 2021-22 and relief package of Rs. 6.29 lakh crore in June 2021.
