                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d): Yes Sir. A report was sought from the State Government of Telangana in this regard. In response, the Government of Telangana has informed that a three-member Committee was constituted to investigate the said matter. The Committee has found that there have been errors in the results due to the inadequate development, readiness and testing of the application suite. However, its magnitude, scale and nature do not vitiate the results as whole. The committee has also observed that no significant variation has been observed in the pass percentage of 2019 when compared with the last two years. --2--LS.US.Q.NO. 2347 FOR 03.12.2019As per direction of a Committee constituted by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education, 53 answer scripts belonging to the candidates who committed or attempted suicide, in their failed subjects were re-verified by subject experts. However, it was observed that there was no change in their results status from fail to Pass even after re-verification. The Committee has further suggested way forward to take all possible steps to reduce the errors, if any, and instill confidence in the minds of students and parents. It has been further informed by the Government of Telangana that a Public Interest Litigations (PIL) and a Writ Petition (Civil) were also filed in the Hon’ble High Court of Telangana and the Hon’ble Supreme Court respectively and both were dismissed. ********
