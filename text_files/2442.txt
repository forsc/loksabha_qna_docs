ANSWER




                                                        (a)to(e)    Expansion, modernization and upgradation of Major Ports in the country is an ongoing process to keep the ports abreast with new technologies and also to promote trade and cargo. This is done through various infrastructure projects conceived by the ports. Most of these projects, after award are executed as per the relevant contractual timelines. These projects are monitored regularly at various levels in the concerned organisations as well as in the Ministry to ensure timely completion of the projects. However, a few projects could not progress as per the contractual timelines for various reasons like delays in environment clearance, non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent, lack of funds with the concessionaire etc.  Major Ports send a status report on Projects to be awarded and Projects to be completed every month to the Ministry, which is reviewed on a monthly basis.                                           *****
