                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) 	Rivers in the country are  mainly polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated  sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution of rivers.   Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitors the water quality of rivers on a regular basis across the country through a network of monitoring stations. As per latest report of CPCB, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on the value of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).  State wise details of identified polluted stretches are given at Annexure.(c)  Various measures are being taken both by Central and State Governments to prevent pollution of rivers and water bodies.  Central Government assists State Governments and Urban Local bodies through schemes like ‘Namami Gange’, National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA) etc. 		Further,  CPCB/State Pollution Control Board and Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1614 to be answered on 28.11.2019 on ‘Most Polluted Rivers’State-Wise Polluted River StretchesS.No.	Name Of State	Name Of Polluted River Stretches	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi,  Kamalpur,  Panchnai Brahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, Bordoibam Beelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, Tenga Pukhuri	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damangang	16	Delhi	Yamuna, 	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, Balehwar Khadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana,  Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, Chunt Kol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, Asangi Nalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala	2115	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal,  Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga	22Contd…16	Maharashtra	Godavari,  Kalu,  Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula,  Mutha,  Nira, Vel, Bhima,  Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti	5317	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah,  Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano	621	Odisha	Gangua, Guradih Nallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, Banguru Nallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal, 	225	Sikkim	Maney Khola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga,  Thirumanim Uthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta	17Grand Total :		351*****
