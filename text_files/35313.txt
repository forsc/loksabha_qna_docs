ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched the first census of water bodies in convergence with the sixth minor irrigation census (reference year 2017-18), under the centrally sponsored scheme – “Irrigation Census”. The objective of the census of water bodies is to develop a national database for all water bodies by collecting information on all important aspects of the subject including their size, condition, status of encroachments, use, storage capacity etc. Presently, the field work and data processing activities of the first census of water bodies is nearing completion in various States/UTs. However, as per currently available data, the tentative figures of State-wise number of water bodies is provided in Annexure I.  (b) The data of water bodies upto fifth minor irrigation census is limited upto village level whereas first census of water bodies which is conducted in convergence with sixth minor irrigation census covers all types of water bodies in both rural and urban areas. Hence, comparison of data of water bodies between fifth and sixth minor irrigation censuses is not feasible.(c) The information on encroachment of water bodies is collected for the first time under the first census of water bodies which is nearing completion. Based on information available, the State-wise number of cases of encroachment of water bodies is given in the Annexure I.(d) Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Accordingly, ?ood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. Union Government supplements the e?orts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional ?nancial assistance for management of floods in critical areas.      Ministry of Jal Shakti has continuously impressed upon the States the need to adopt ?ood plain zoning approach. Ganga Flood Control Commission under Ministry of Jal Shakti has also continuously impressed upon the basin States on the need to take follow-up action to implement the ?ood plain zoning approach in various meetings of the Commission with representatives of State Governments. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has time to time advised all States in Ganga Basin, including Bihar, for demarcation, delineation and noti?cation of river ?ood plains and removal of encroachments from river bed/?ood plain of the river Ganga and its tributaries.(e) Action on reported encroachment of water bodies is taken by the respective State Governments, as it comes under the purview of the State Government concerned. However, from time to time Union Government has been sensitizing the State Governments regarding importance of water bodies for socio economic development and sustainable water security to the local population. Need for taking necessary steps for keeping the water bodies encroachment free, such as inclusion of water bodies in land records and making them integral part of town planning process, strict action for the encroachers, etc. is also being emphasized to the State Governments by Union Government, from time to time.  ******  ANNEXURE IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2535 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2022 REGARDING “DATA ON WATER BODIES”.State-wise number of water bodies and number of encroachments reported in the first Census of Water bodies (Provisional) S.No.	States/UTs	Total number of water bodies reported	Total number of encroachments reported(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)1	ANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS	3528	592	ANDHRA PRADESH	190777	39203	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	993	04	ASSAM	172492	135	BIHAR	45793	8716	CHANDIGARH	188	07	GOA	1463	88	GUJARAT	54069	229	HARYANA	14898	5010	HIMACHAL PRADESH	88017	4211	JHARKHAND	107598	56012	KERALA	55734	11113	MANIPUR	1658	614	MEGHALAYA	13332	615	MIZORAM	2185	716	NAGALAND	1432	117	PUDUCHERRY	1171	3418	PUNJAB	16012	157819	SIKKIM	134	020	TAMIL NADU	106957	836621	TELENGANA	64056	303222	UTTARAKHAND	3096	5 ******
