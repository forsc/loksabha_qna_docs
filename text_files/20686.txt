The portal gives information about individual CPSEs/ Central Ministries, State Governments etc. and other buyers regarding the payments pending with them in respect of the MSEs. The said portal also facilitates MSEs to file their delayed payments related complaints online. After 15 days of online filing of the case, it is registered by the MSEFC.After the announcement made by the Hon’ble Finance Minister under Atmanirbhar Bharat, a special sub-portal has been created within SAMADHAAN to track delayed payment to the MSMEs from the CPSEs. From May 2020 to January 2021, dues of Rs 31,315.11 crore have been settled through this portal. Further, in order to provide relief from the problem of delayed payment from the MSMEs and as an initiative from the Hon’ble Prime Minister in the ‘MSME outreach programme’, notification dated 02.11.2018 has been issued with the direction that all CPSEs and all companies with the turnover of Rs 500 crore or more shall be required to get themselves onboard on the TReDS platforms. SIDBI vide letter dated 26.08.2020 informed about the fees exemption for onboarding of registration of MSMEs on the TReDS till 31.03.2021. Government has also publicized the exemption of fees and charges for registration on TReDS platform to the MSMEs. However, it may be noted that traders are not considered as MSMEs and the provisions of the Act are not applicable to them.(b)& (c):	Government consistently engages with the industry stakeholders to protect the domestic industry through suitable measures including tariff and non-tariff barriers.(d):	The Government of India announced a special economic and comprehensive package viz. AatmaNirbhar Bharat package for boosting economy of the country and making India self-reliant. Relief and credit support measures have been announced for various sectors including MSMEs.

Textiles products: MMF segment and technical textiles has been figured out among the 10 key sectors with approved financial outlay of Rs 10,683 crore over a five year period. Accordingly this Ministry is formulating a scheme to promote identified MMF Apparel and Technical Textile lines to capture substantial share in global trade.Union Budget announcements 2021-22 include the launch of Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (MITRA) Parks scheme. To enable the textile industry to become globally competitive, attract large investments and boost employment generation, 7 Textile Parks will be established over 3 years.
