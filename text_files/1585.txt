ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(c): No, Sir.  The refractory industry caters to many industries such as ferrous, non-ferrous, glass, cement, etc. In Iron & Steel industry three types of refractories viz. acidic, basic and neutral are used based on the specific process requirements in the different units of the iron & steel making. In the Integrated Steel Plants, refractories are used in Blast Furnace, BOF Converters, EAF/ EOF, Re-heating Furnaces of Rolling Mills, Heat Treatment Furnaces, Continuous Casting Machine Tundish, Steel Ladles, Coke Ovens, Sinter Plant etc.The Iron & Steel and the refractory industry are deregulated sectors; and the commercial decisions are taken by the industries themselves based on market dynamics. Based on commercial decision, some of the steel companies have done backward integration and have setup in-house refractories manufacturing facilities. The National Steel Policy 2017 has duly envisaged the requirement of refractories to match a steel making capacity of 300 Million Tonnes by 2030-31. Synergies/ backward integration/ production/ import by the refractory or iron & steel industry shall be based on commercial considerations.********
