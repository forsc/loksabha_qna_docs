ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR )(a):	Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme is implemented to evaluate the fertility of soil across the country by adopting uniform norms of soil sampling in a grid of 2.5 ha in irrigated areas and  10ha  in   rainfed areas;    uniform testing of 12 parameters i.e. major nutrients (N, P&K), secondary nutrients (S), micro nutrients (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn& B) and other parameters on pH, EC & Organic Carbon. During 2019-20, a pilot project was implemented under which soil sampling was done on farm holding bases with farmers participation. The State/ UT-wise extent of micronutrients deficiency is given at Annexure-I.(b) & (c):	As such, there is no harmful effect of chemical fertilizers on soil health with balanced and judicious use. However, investigations carried out by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘Long Term Fertilizer Experiments’ have indicated that continuous/over use of nitrogenous fertilizer alone had deleterious effect on soil health and crop productivity showing deficiencies of other major and micro nutrients. Even with recommended doses of NPK, deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients has become yield limiting factor over the years. Therefore, Government recommends soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients to prevent deterioration of soil fertility.(d) & (e):	Government is implementing Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme since 2015 to provide soil test based fertilizer use recommendations to the farmers in all States/ UTs including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  Soil health card provides nutrient status of the soil along with prescription about balanced and integrated use of inorganic and organic fertilizers to maintain good soil health that results in increase in production. The number of farmers provided with soil health cards during last 3 years, State/ UT-wise is given at Annexure-II.
