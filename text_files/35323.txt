ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY                                (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c):  In view of Pandemic & Covid Protocol, with effect from 20.03.2020 Indian Railways has continued concession to only four categories of Divyangjan, eleven categories of Patients and Students. Due to challenges posed by Covid-19, total passenger revenue generated during 2020-21 is less in comparison to the year 2019-2020 Pre-Covid period. Cost of granting concessions weigh heavily on Railways, hence extending the scope of concessions to all categories of passengers including senior citizens is not desirable at present.  In spite of above challenges, Railways has continued to provide concessions to passengers namely four categories of Divyangjans, eleven categories of Patients, and Students.		                                               *****
