                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE	???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)    As per the results of Agriculture Census 2015-16, State/UT-wise number and percentage of marginal &small operational holders and marginal female operational holders in the country is given at Annexure.(b)   Government has taken several measures to make small holdings more viable. These include adoption of modern technologies and practices like multiple cropping, intercropping and integrated farming systems. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is conducting research programme to develop location specific varieties and technologies for enhancing the production and productivity of farm holdings. Support is also provided to farmers (including small and marginal farmers) through initiatives and programmes of the Government like interest subvention scheme, Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Neem coated Urea, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchay Yojana (PMKSY), Pradhan Mantri FasalBima Yojana (PMFBY), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) etc.(c)    As per the Demand Supply projection made by the NITI Aayog for 2033, the balance sheet is projected to be quite affirmative for the foodgrains as a whole and further increase in production of foodgrains is suggested to be achieved mainly through increase in productivity of crops. For this, the Government of India is implementing several Crop Development Schemes/Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card etc. Also, assistance is being provided for various interventions like different types of demonstrations on latest crops production technologies, promotion of newly released High Yielding Varieties (HYVs)/Hybrids, climate resilient varieties/stress tolerant/bio-fortified varieties, Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) & Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, water conservation devices, improved farm implements/tools and capacity building of farmers etc., through State Governments.(d)    To achieve further growth in agricultural area under irrigation and to meet the objectives of National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Government is implementing Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana(PMKSY) since 2015-16 with the motto of “Har Khet Ko Pani” for providing end to end solutions in irrigation supply chain viz, water resources, distribution network and farm level applications. This scheme is being implemented through its four components viz, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), PMKSY-Har Khet Ko Pani, PMKSY-Watershed, PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop. The PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop component of the scheme focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation viz., Drip and Sprinkler irrigation systems. Besides promoting Micro Irrigation, this component also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement source creation for Micro Irrigation.Under this component,about 57.31 lakh ha. area has been brought under the coverage of micro irrigation during the period 2015-16 to 2020-21.
