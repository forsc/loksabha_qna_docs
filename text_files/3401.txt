                                                        MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	& (b): Section 32 (4) of the Waqf Act 1995 as amended, empowers State Waqf Board (SWB) to develop waqf having potential for development as an educational institutions, shopping centre, market, housing or residential flats and the like, through Muttawalli of the concerned waqf.  	To further facilitate development of waqf properties, this Ministry implements “Shahari Waqf Sampatti Vikas Yojana (SWSVY)” under which interest free loans are provided to State/UT Waqf Boards (SWBs)/Waqf Institutions in the country for construction of economically viable buildings on vacant urban waqf land such as commercial complex, marriage halls, hospitals, cold storage etc. In addition, National Waqf Development Corporation Limited (NAWADCO) a company under the administrative supervision of this Ministry has also been incorporated with the objective of developing waqf properties for enhancing the income of SWBs, which can in turn be utilized for socio-economic development of the community. A provision has also been made under Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) for construction of projects on Waqf land provided by respective authority/Board free of any lease amount/nominal amount for a particular period on lease basis.(c)	: Does not arise. However, Major provisions added in the amended Waqf Act 1995 giving more power to State Waqf Boards to deal with encroachment on waqf properties inter alia include stringent definition  of “encroacher”; mandate to State Governments to appoint Survey Commissioners and to complete the survey of waqf properties in a time bound manner; rigorous imprisonment for alienation of waqf properties without prior approval of the State Waqf Boards; alienation of waqf property to be cognizable and non-bailable offence; three member Tribunals with extended jurisdiction to deal with  disputes concerning eviction of a tenant. Central Government monitors compliance of various provisions of Waqf Act by State Governments/ State Waqf Boards from time to time.********
