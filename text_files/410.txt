                                                        (a) to (d)	 There is demand for skilled manpower at the shop floors for leather footwear as well as non-leather footwear, leather garments and leather goods and accessories manufacturing in the country. According to estimation done by Leather Sector Skill Council (LSSC), which is working under National Skill Development Corporation, demand for manpower is estimated at around 1,07,000 people per annum in various parts of the country. LSSC has made a significant impact on facilitating an ecosystem for training in leather industry.

More than 63,000 youths have been trained in the leather sector under PMKVY scheme.		Government has approved a Central Sector Scheme called "Indian Footwear, Leather & Accessories Development Programme" with an approved outlay of Rs. 2600 crore for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20. Under Human Resource Development (HRD) sub-scheme of Indian Footwear, Leather & Accessories Development Programme, primary skill development training is provided to unemployed persons in leather and footwear sector. As on date, primary skill development training has been imparted to 1,84,136 unemployed persons and 1,33,136 trainees have been provided placement in leather and footwear sector since 2017-18.
