The efficacy rate of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines against each of the mutations is as under:Strain	Covaxin	Covishield/OxfordUK Strain	Non-significant difference in efficacy against UK Strain	Efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive infection is 74.6% against UK strainSouth Africa Strain	Analysis is ongoing	10% efficacyBrazil Strain	Non-significant difference in efficacy against Brazil Strain	Effective(d):  Continuous monitoring of evolution of mutations is being done by the Indian SARS- CoV-2 Genomics Surveillance Consortium (INSACOG). Besides, National Institute of Virology (NIV) is continuously engaged in virus isolation of different SARS-CoV-2 strains for further research.(e):  Strains from South Africa and Brazil have been detected in travelers coming to India from the said countries.

The need to change composition of Covaxin has not been felt yet in view of good efficacy of the vaccine against variants.
