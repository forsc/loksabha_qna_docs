ANSWER




(a) & (b):	Yes, Sir. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), an independent body of experts under Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), monitors the prices of Scheduled and Non scheduled drugs in India as per provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). As per provisions of Para 16 of the DPCO, 2013, Pharmaceutical Companies may increase/decrease the prices of scheduled drugs on the basis of annual wholesale price index (WPI) for preceding calendar year on 1st April every year and as per provisions of Para 20 of the DPCO, 2013 manufacturers of Non scheduled formulations may increase the MRP of their formulations maximum up to 10 % of the maximum retail price during preceding twelve months.  If a company violates the provisions of DPCO, 2013, action for overcharging is taken against the company. (c):	NPPA has launched a mobile app “PharmaSahi Dam” and a consumer complaint platform “Pharma Jan Samadhan” to disseminate information on drug pricing and for consumer grievances. Consumer complaints are addressed through the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal, in a time bound manner.To create consumer awareness, there also exists a Central Sector Scheme named Consumer Awareness, Publicity and Price Monitoring (CAPPM). The Scheme is implemented at the Central level by NPPA and at the State level through Price Monitoring and Resource Units (PMRUs). The guidelines of the Scheme are available on the website of Department of Pharmaceuticals i.e. https://pharmaceuticals.gov.in/schemes. CAPPM also creates Consumer awareness through print and electronic media, organizing seminars etc.*******
