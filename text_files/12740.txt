As per provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013), Pharmaceutical Companies may increase the prices of scheduled drugs as per provisions of Para 16 of DPCO, 2013 on the basis of annual wholesale price index (WPI) for preceding calendar year on 1st April every year and as per provisions of Para 20 of DPCO, 2013 manufacturers of Non scheduled formulations may increase the MRP of their formulations maximum up to 10 % of the maximum retail price during preceding twelve months. No specific approval is required from the Government for increase in prices of the drugs.*******
