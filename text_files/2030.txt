                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b): Import of toys has always been subject to Indian standards. The revised norms/ guidelines in this regard are in place since 01.09.2017. These guidelines are in the nature of standards which are primarily for safety reasons. As per revised norms, import of toys shall be permitted freely when accompanied by:i.	a certificate of conformity to the standards by the importer  as prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and ii.	a certificate of conformity from the manufacturer that representative sample of the toys being imported have been tested by an independent laboratory which is accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), India. (c)	& (d): India does not maintain any country specific import restriction except for considerations like scientific, environmental, health & life of human, animal and plant . Adequate provisions exist to protect the Indian consumers as imported goods are subject to domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms. Further, India has an elaborate and robust legal framework and institutional set up to protect its environment, life and health of its people, plants and animals. The BIS standards applicable to domestic goods are also applicable to imported goods.****
