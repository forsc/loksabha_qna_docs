                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.    ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3879 BY SHRI VIVEK NARAYAN SHEJWALKAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.12.2019 REGARDING CONSTRUCTION OF ROBs(a): No, Sir. The details of 3 under construction Road over Bridges (ROBs) are as under:Tansen Road-Mela Racecourse: This work has been sanctioned on deposit term basis in 2018-19. The work of Railway portion is being constructed by Railways and approaches by State Government. Work of Railway portion as well as approach portion is in progress. Efforts will be made to expedite this work as soon as possible.Birlanagar and Mallgarha Chauraha ROB: Work for construction of 2 ROBs at Level Crossings (LCs) Nos. 426 at Birlanagar and Mallgarha Chauraha at Level Crossing (LC) No. 427 has been sanctioned on cost sharing basis with State Government in 2016-17. The work of Railway portion of both ROBs is being constructed by Railways and approaches by State Government. Work of Railway portion as well as approach portion is in progress. Efforts will be made to expedite these works as soon as possible.Harishankarpuram ROB: Work for construction of ROB in lieu of Harishankarpuram behind A.G office has been sanctioned in Budget 2019-20 under Umbrella works.(b): Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion. However, it is difficult to construct ROBs/RUBs on approaches because it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc. Therefore, it is not possible to fix the time schedule for construction of ROBs/RUBs projects.(c) to (e): Railway has made arrangements for drainage in their part of subway to keep them functional during monsoon. To avoid water logging during monsoon, necessary sump and pump arrangement has been made.*****
