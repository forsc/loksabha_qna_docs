                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)  FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)  (a)     Yes, Sir. Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports undertakes character development of young students in country through its National Service Scheme (NSS) which was introduced in 1969 with the primary objective of developing the personality and character of the student youth through voluntary community service. NSS is being implemented in senior secondary schools, colleges and universities. The design of NSS envisages that each education institute covered under the scheme has at least one NSS unit comprising of 100 student volunteers led by teacher designated as Programme Officer (PO). Each NSS unit adopts a village or slum for taking up its activities. NSS attempts to establish meaningful linkage between ‘campus and community’; ‘college and village’; and ‘knowledge and action’.        (b)  & (c)   Yes, Sir. With a view to develop leadership qualities among the youth of India, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has launched ‘National Young Leaders Programme (NYLP)’ a Central Sector Scheme, in December, 2014 which enables youth to realise their full potential and to contribute to the nation-building process.  The scheme aims at motivating the youth to strive for excellence in their respective fields and to bring them to the forefront of the development process. It seeks to harness the immense youth energy for national-building. The Programme beneficiaries are the youth in the age-group of 15-29 years, in line with the definition of ‘youth’ in the National Youth Policy, 2014. The Programme has following 5 components: a) Neighbourhood Youth Parliament  b) Youth for Development Programme   c) National Young Leaders Awards  d) National Youth Advisory Council  e) National Youth Development Fund   *******
