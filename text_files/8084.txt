ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b):  Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS - UDAN is market driven mechanism. Under the scheme, airlines assess demand and nature of supply required on particular route and based on their analysis participate in the bidding process to be conducted from time to time. In the first round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), routes connecting Jeypore, Utkela, Rourkela and Jharsuguda airports were awarded. Routes connecting these airports were however cancelled subsequently due to the non compliance of Selected Airline Operator (SAO) Agreement. These airports were offered under second and third rounds of bidding under RCS-UDAN. However, no valid bid was received for Jeypore and Utkela Airport. Under UDAN third round, RCS routes connecting Jharsuguda airport to Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Raipur airport were awarded. Operations on these routes, except Jharsuguda-Mumbai have commenced. Jharsuguda-Mumbai route could not be operationalized as the Selected Airline Operator has suspended its operations. Routes from Rourkela to Bhubaneswar and Rourkela to Raipur were awarded to SAOs. However, operations could not be commenced due to non-readiness of Rourkela Airport for the aircraft (ATR - 72) mentioned in the bid by the SAO. (c) & (d) : With the repeal of Air Corporation Act in March, 1994, the Indian domestic aviation has been deregulated and airlines are free to select any market and network they wish to service and operate. Government has, however, laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines, with a view to achieve better air connectivity to different regions in the country. It is therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability subject to compliance with Route Dispersal Guidelines issued by Government.
