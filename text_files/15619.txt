ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		Central Electricity Authority (CEA) conducts Electric Power Survey (EPS) every five years for estimating the electricity demand of the country. The state wise demand as projected by the 19th EPS (published in January 2017) for the year 2018-19 to 2026-27 is given at Annexure. The impact of increase in demand due to SAUBHAGYA Yojana has also been considered in this assessment. (b) & (c) :	As per National Electricity Plan (NEP) published in March 2018, likely installed capacity to meet the projected energy demand in 2021-22 is 4,79,418 MW and in 2026-27 is 6,19,066 MW. To enhance generation capacity to meet the growing demand of power in the country, the following measures have been taken by Government of India to increase power production:(i)	Thermal and hydro power plants are at various stages of construction in the country;(ii)	Nuclear Power projects of 1700 MW capacity are in an advanced stage of planning; and(iii)	The Government has a target of 1,75,000 MW installed capacity from renewable sources, including solar, wind, biomass and small hydro; out of which 86,759 MW have been installed and 33,720 MW are under installation.  		Requirement of transmission system addition in the country has been estimated for the period 2017-22 as part of National Electricity Plan (Volume II: Transmission). As per National Electricity Plan (Volume II: Transmission), about 110,000 ckm of transmission lines and about 383,000 MVA of transformation capacity in the substations (at 220 kV and above voltage levels) would be required to be added during the period 2017-22. Out of this, during April 2017 to February 2020, 55,782 ckm and 2,21,658 MVA have been added to the electricity grid.  With this estimated generation installed capacity & additional transmission system, the electricity demand projected as per 19th Electric Power Survey (EPS) is likely to be fully met.*************
