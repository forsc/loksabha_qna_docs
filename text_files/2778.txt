                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement referred to in reply to Parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 226 due for answer on 09.07.2019(a) & (b):	As reported by the State Government of Bihar, out of 17, 734 road projects sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), 15,860 road projects have already been completed. In Supual District of Bihar, out of 224 road projects sanctioned under PMGSY, 167 road projects have already been completed and 44 road projects are under various stages of completion and targeted for completion by March, 2020. Out of the remaining 13 road projects,  work on 2 road projects are held up due to land dispute, 2 are under tender process and  9 road works are proposed for dropping as the targeted habitations have been provided connectivity through other Schemes. (c):	PMGSY is a one-time special intervention of Government of India to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network with a population of 500 persons and above in plain area as per Census, 2001. Out of 630 eligible habitations of designated population size of 500+ in core network in Supaul District of Bihar, 606 habitations have already been provided connectivity, including 168 habitations provided connectivity by the State using their own resources, till June, 2019.  The process is underway to connect balance feasible habitations at the earliest. (d):	PMGSY has a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY.  Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory.  The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction.  Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. Based on the periodic monitoring of quality of roads under the 3-tier mechanism, corrective measures, wherever necessary, are taken by the State Governments.The progress of implementation of rural roads under PMGSY is regularly reviewed by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings, Pre-Empowered/Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. At District level, the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (Disha) headed by a Member of Parliament (LS) monitors the implementation of various schemes of Government of India including PMGSY.  In addition to this, special review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries of the States.*****
