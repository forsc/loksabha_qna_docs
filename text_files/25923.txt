Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and, in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during 2015-16 by the Central Government with an overarching vision to ensure access to some means of protective irrigation for all agricultural farms in the country, and to produce ‘per drop more crop’, thus bringing much desired rural prosperity. PMKSY is having following components, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP)-Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) / Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies and Ground Water Irrigation in this Department.  During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going major/medium irrigation projects (and 7 phases), in the country under PMKSY have been prioritised in consultation with States for completion in phases. Funding mechanism has been approved by the Government for providing Central and State Share under Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) through NABARD. The State-wise details of these 99 prioritized projects (including phases) under PMKSY is given at Annexure-I.Contd…P/2//2//Out of these 99 prioritized projects of PMKSY, at present there is no project included from the State of West Bengal. Five projects are of Karnataka, namely Upper Tunga Irrigation Project, Shri Rameshwara Irrigation, Bhima LIS, Karanja and NLBC Projects. AIBP works of three of them namely Shri Rameswar Irrigation, Bhima LIS and Karanja projects have been reported to be completed whereas two projects namely Upper Tunga and NLBC System project are ongoing. During 2016-17 to 2020-21, under AIBP, Central Assistance of Rs.1186.62 crore has been released for these projects of Karnataka and an additional irrigation potential of 1.16 lakh hectare has been reported to be created by these projects in Karnataka. Under the ongoing Command Area Development & Water Management Program (CADWM), the targeted Culturable Command Area (CCA) of these five projects is 84.00 Thousand Hectare at an estimated cost of Rs. 1016 crore with targeted Central Assistance of Rs 175 crore. Central Assistance amounting to Rs. 75.28 crore has been released to the Karnataka State till June 2021, and State has reported a CCA Progress of 34.7 Thousand Hectare.PMKSY-HKKP-Ground Water Irrigation (PMKSY-HKKP-GW) scheme aims to provide financial assistance to States for assured ground water irrigation to small and marginal farmers. Scheme is applicable only in areas having stage of ground water development less than 60%, average rainfall more than 750 mm rainfall and with shallow ground water levels (less than 15 m bgl). Under this scheme, so far 15 projects in 12 States including West Bengal have been approved since 2019. No scheme has been approved in respect of Karnataka. The State-wise details of PMKSY-HKKP-GW projects are given at Annexure-II.Under the Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP) scheme, financial assistance was being provided to State Governments for taking up critical works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, anti-sea erosion, flood proofing etc. in critical regions and restoration of damaged flood control/ management works. The scheme had a provision only for clearing the committed liabilities of ongoing and completed projects as per extant XI/ XII Plan guidelines and no new project to be included under FM component of FMBAP Scheme till then. The details central assistance released to State of West Bengal under Flood Management Programme (FMP) and River Management Activities & Works related to Border Areas (RMBA) components of FMBAP for period 2016-17 to 2020-21 are given at Annexure-III.Government of India has approved a State Sector Scheme "Dam Rehabilitation & Improvement Project (DRIP) Phase-II & III” with Central Component.

The details of these projects, under appraisal in CWC are given at Annexure-V. The Budget allocation and expenditure is done scheme–wise and not State-wise.
