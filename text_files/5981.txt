ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) The Central Government has taken a number of regulatory measures for prevention, control and abatement of industrial pollution. One such measure for regulating industries discharging effluent into a water course is the determination of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPI) based on their pollution load (Biochemical Oxygen Demand 100 kg per day) and/ or handling of hazardous chemicals specified under the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989. These units as well as 17 category of highly polluting industries are regularly monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/ State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) for discharge of effluents. CPCB has issued directions to all 17 category of highly polluting industries as well as GPIs in Ganga Basin States to install Online Effluent/ Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) with connectivity to SPCBs/ PCCs concerned and CPCB for real-time monitoring of discharge of effluents and emission. Inspections of highly polluting industries based on the computer generated alerts from OCEMS are being carried out by CPCB since 2016-17. CPCB in co-ordination with the SPCBs/ PCCs identified 1162 units spread over 22 States/ UTs as GPIs in the year 2011 for taking concerted actions for control of pollution. Of these 992 industries were operational among which 792 were complying with environmental standards. As per the most recent data collated by CPCB from 36 States/ UTs, 2743 industries have been brought under the classification of GPIs for regular monitoring by CPCB/ SPCBs/ PCCs. Of these 2497 units are currently operational and 246 units have closed on their own. Among the operational units, 2222 units are reported to be complying with environmental standards. State-wise status of GPIs is at Annexure.The increase of 136% in the number of industries could be partly attributed to the fact that the identification done in 2011 covered only 22 States/ UTs while the present data covers all the States/ UTs. Increased industrialization/ development over the time, stringent monitoring assisted by violation-alerts generated from OCEMS, etc. could be other reasons. The current status of compliance of operational industries has improved as compared to the compliance status of 2011. While the current percentage of compliance is 89% (i.e., 2222 complying units out of 2497 operational ones), the corresponding percentage for 2011 is 79.8% (i.e., 792 complying units out of 992 operational ones).In addition to the installation of OCEMS and alert-based random inspections, the various other measures taken by the Government to ensure treatment of effluents by industries, including GPIs, are as follows:•	Revision of effluent standards of various industrial sectors from time-to-time. •	Amendment of the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 from time-to-time; the Rules presently specify 684 hazardous and toxic chemicals in place of 434 originally notified.•	Revision of criteria for categorization of industries based on their pollution potential into ‘Red’, ‘Orange’, ‘Green’ and ‘White’ categories to encourage industries to adopt processes with less pollution potential. •	Directions issued by CPCB to all SPCBs/PCCs to adopt the revised categorization for issuance of Consent to Establish/ Operate to ‘Red’, ‘Orange’ and ‘Green’ categories of industries.•	Issuance of appropriate directions by CPCB under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 to non-complying units and under section 18 (1) (b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to SPCBs/ PCCs.*****
