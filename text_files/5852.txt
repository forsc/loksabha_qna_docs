The reasons for the gap includes, adoption of cropping pattern different from the envisaged pattern in the project design, less   inflow  received in dam  due  to interception in catchment area or due to reduction in rainfall, water allocation for non-irrigation purpose, condition of the main canal and distribution system becomes not hydraulically unfit, non-existence/improper maintenance of water conveyances systems & field channels, change in Culturable Command Area (CCA), unauthorized utilization etc.Irrigation   being  a  State  subject, projects are planned, executed and operated by the State Governments themselves from their own resources as per their own priority and availability of funds.  To supplement the efforts of the State Governments the Govt. of India provides technical and financial support under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) for speedy completion of irrigation projects and Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) Programme to improve and achieve maximum utilization of irrigation potential created. Both AIBP & CADWM are subsumed within Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) launched in 2015 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Pani’ ensuring   access   to  some  means   of protective irrigation to all agricultural farms in the country. To expedite completion, 99 (106 including phases) projects under AIBP are prioritized and the CADWM Programme corresponding to these prioritized irrigation projects are implemented. The CADWM Programme being implemented pari passu the prioritized irrigation projects is to bridge the gap between Irrigation Potential Created and Irrigation Potential Utilized.The details of CA released in 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19 for the prioritized irrigation projects are given at Annexure-II and details of CA released in 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19 for CADWM are given at Annexure-III.***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Unstarred Question No. 5384 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 25.07.2019 regarding “Irrigation potential”Details of Ultimate Irrigation Potential (UIP) and Irrigation Potential Created (IPC)Potential  in Th.
