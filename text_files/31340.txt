                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) & (b): ‘Prisons’/‘persons detained therein’ is a ‘State’ subject as per Entry 4 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Administration and management of prisoners is the responsibility of State Governments, who are competent to devise and implement appropriate schemes for reintegration of women prisoners into the society and for taking steps for the welfare of the children of women inmates and their rehabilitation etc. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued several advisories to the States and Union Territories (UTs) from time to time for providing vocational and skill development training to prisoners, including women inmates. MHA has also advised the States and UTs to coordinate  and  collaborate  with  their  Skill  Development  Departments  in  this regard and for making provision for suitable opportunities for the development of skills of prison inmates, particularly women prisoners. States and UTs have also been advised to formulate suitable schemes and develop policies for providing employment to released convicts. The Model Prison Manual 2016 prepared and circulated by MHA to all States and UTs has specific chapters on ‘Vocational training and skill development programmes’, ‘After-Care and Rehabilitation’ and ‘Women Prisoners’ etc. The guidelines contained in these chapters provide detailed guidance to the States about the rehabilitation and reintegration of prison inmates, including women inmates. (c) & (d): MHA has issued an advisory to all States and UTs forwarding the guidelines for the welfare of the children of women inmates. These guidelines, inter-alia, provide that the children of inmates should have access to education, recreational facilities, food, shelter and medical assistance etc. Model Prison Manual 2016 also provides that prison administration should ensure holistic development of children of women inmates. MHA had also circulated a report titled ‘Women in Prisons’ prepared by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to all States and UTs. The report, inter-alia, contains specific recommendations on ‘children of women prisoners’ and ‘better living arrangements’ for women inmates and their children, etc.*****
