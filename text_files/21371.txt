There was considerable demand for it during the exhibition and many requests to continue this scheme of ‘My Stamp’ were received after the ‘INDIPEX-2011’ exhibition. This enthusiasm from stamp lovers prompted India Post to introduce the ‘My Stamp’ scheme on pan India basis. This scheme is available in important Post Offices.(b)	 29,53,500 sheets of My Stamps have since been printed under 209 themes and released after its inception. (c)	 Revenue generated State/UT-wise on account of ‘My Stamp’ scheme during the last three calendar years i.e. 2018, 2019 and 2020 is at Annexure-A.
