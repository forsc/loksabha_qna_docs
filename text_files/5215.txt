                                                        a)	& (b) The scheme of Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) aims to provide quality middle and high school level education to Scheduled Tribe (ST) students in remote areas. Earlier it was a component of Grants under Article 275(1). During 2018-19, a separate scheme was introduced. As per extant approval of the Government, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School by the year 2022. Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts, i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsil having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. Out of these 564 sub-districts, EMRSs have been sanctioned in 102 sub-districts at the inception of the scheme. From the remaining 462 sub-districts, 145 new EMRSs and 5 new Eklavya Model Day Boarding Schools (EMDBS) are sanctioned, during 2018-19 and 2019-20, across the country.c)	The total number of EMRSs sanctioned till date to the State of Telangana is 16, out of which 11 schools are functional(list attached as Annexure). d)	Funds are released to the States for construction of EMRSs as well as for recurring cost based on the actual number of students enrolled in all EMRSs in that State in a particular year. Extant cost norms for new EMRS is Rs.20.00 crore; in the case of North East, hilly areas, difficult areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism, cost may go up by 20% over the normal cost norm. The recurring cost per student per year is Rs. 1,09,000/- with effect from the year 2019-20. *****Annexure referred to in reply to part (c ) of LS USQ No. 4783 for 22.07.2019EMRSs sanctioned in TelanganaS.
