National Service Scheme (NSS) was introduced in 1969 with the primary objective of developing the personality and character of the student youth through voluntary community service. ‘Education through Service’ is the purpose of the NSS. The ideological orientation of the NSS is inspired by the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. Very appropriately, the motto of NSS is “NOT ME, BUT YOU” in Hindi “????? ?? ???? ??”. An NSS volunteer places the ‘community’ before ‘self’.  At Present, NSS has about 40 lakh volunteers on its rolls spread over 479 Universities, 51 +2 Councils covering 17,676 colleges and 12,087 schools. The achievements of NSS are in the form of development of personality and character of the student volunteers. NSS has made significant contribution to mass literacy, health, family welfare & nutrition, environment conservation, social service programme, women empowerment, relief and rehabilitation during natural calamities etc. As a means to encourage the NSS Volunteers to recognise their outstanding contributions towards community service, the Ministry confers the NSS Awards every year in the following 3 categories with a view to further promote NSS across the country:-<pre>S.No	Category	No. of Awards	Value of Award1.
