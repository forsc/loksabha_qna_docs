                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT (SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a): There is no separate published data for unorganized sector as a whole. However, as per results of Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Sample Survey Office, Ministry of Statistics and programme Implementation during 2017-2018, percentage distribution of workers in usual status (principal status+subsidiary status) in AGEGC sectors(The coverage of AGEGC Sector is [Ag]riculture sector [E]xcluding [G]rowing of [C]rops, market gardening, horticulture and growing of crops combined with farming of animals) and non-agricultural sectors in different enterprises of the country are given at Annexure-I to  IV.(b) to (f): As per the results of PLFS survey methodology the percentage of the workforce engaged in formal and informal economy, sector-wise and gender-wise, State/UT-wise is placed at Annexure-V.Government has taken a number of steps towards expansion of the formal sector. These are as under:Under the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Labour & Employment there has been a significant improvement in the registration of beneficiaries and 1.2 crores number of employees benefitted in the last three year, which is an indication of shifting from informal sector to the formal sector for availing the Social Security Benefit. In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganized sector including workers in agriculture sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganized workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti BimaYojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganized workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share without any burden on the beneficiary. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of minimum assured monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganized workers after attaining the age of 60 years. Prescribed monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government.*****
