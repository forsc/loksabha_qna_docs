                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		Yes, Sir. The Government of India has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which inter-alia   covers complete prohibition on employment or work of children below 14 years of age in all  occupations  and  processes  and  prohibition  on employment of   adolescents   (14 to 18 years of age)   in    hazardous Contd..2/-:: 2 ::occupations or processes. Further, the Schedule to the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 which came into effect on 30.08.2017, prescribes 38 hazardous occupations and processes where adolescents (aged 14-18 years) are prohibited to work and also prescribes 107 hazardous occupations and processes where children (aged under 14 years) are prohibited to help (in family or family enterprises).(b): 		No, Sir.(c): 		No, Sir. Under the Schedule to the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 which came into effect on 30.08.2017, adolescents (aged 14-18 years) are prohibited to work and children (aged under 14 years) are prohibited to help (in family or family enterprises) in hazardous processes such as beedi-making or processing of tobacco.(d) & (e): 	The Government of India has been implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme since 1988. Under the NCLP Scheme, children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres (STCs) under the District Project Societies, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system. Children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).             	 As soon as the information is found about the child or adolescent to be engaged in hazardous work, the child or adolescent is rescued and withdrawn from such work/occupation. The rescued child (if aged 9-14 years) is enrolled in an STC, where he is provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  The rescued adolescent (aged 14-18 years) is facilitated by vocational training opportunities under existing schemes of skill development.           	The Amended Act has also made stricter punishment for the employers contravening the provisions of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable.******
