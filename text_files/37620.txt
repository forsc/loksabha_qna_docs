ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (c)	The estimated total number of Indians (NRIs) living in foreign countries as per the latest available data with the Ministry is 1.345 crore. The country wise details of Indian passport holders who are abroad as per details available from our Missions is at Annexure-I.(b)	Several steps have been taken by the Government of India to ensure safety and security of Indian passport holders abroad.  Any issue pertaining to Indians abroad is dealt by the Mission/Posts on priority basis. Missions/Posts conduct open houses for NRIs to discuss issues related to their safety and security. These issues are further highlighted and taken up with the host government wherever necessary for action on priority basis.  Besides, the Ministry organizes awareness workshops on safe and legal migration for the welfare of our workers and to generate awareness among them.  A Pre-Departure Orientation Training (PDOT) is imparted to the workers before they migrate to foreign countries.  Also a PDOT manual for prospective emigrants has been prepared, including its translation in regional languages.  Online PDOT has also been launched to reach out to women and prospective migrants from remote areas.  The Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY) provides insurance for workers.  Some other initiatives like MADAD Portal, Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF), E-migrate Portal, Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayta Kendra (PBSK), etc. help NRIs to get assistance and address their grievances and ensure their safety and security. Grievances are also registered and responded through various channels like calls, walk-in, e-mails, Twitter, Whatsapp, 24 x 7 Helpline and other Social Media accounts of Missions/Posts. Furthermore, to facilitate the return of Indian nationals stranded in various countries due to restriction imposed in the wake of pandemic, the Vande Bharat Mission was undertaken. Recently, under Operation Ganga, the Government evacuated Indian nationals, largely students stranded in the Ukraine conflict Zone.  During such crises, our Missions/Posts abroad proactively help distressed/stranded Indian nationals in terms of providing food, shelter, medicine and return back to India.(d) & (e)   Each evacuation mission is undertaken taking into account the local security situation.  Government engages with the host government as well as the neighboring countries to ensure the most efficient and secure way of evacuating our nationals from conflict zones. Around 22,500 Indian Nationals, mostly students, were evacuated from Ukraine under Operation Ganga. ***
