(a) to (e): Government has been consistently encouraging and incentivizing increased private sector investment for overall development of Food Processing sector of the country to promote value addition in agricultural and allied sector and reduce wastages. Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing a Central Sector umbrella scheme- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) since 2016-17 for overall growth and development of food processing sector, mostly through private sector participation. Under the component schemes, MoFPI provides credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries with farm level infrastructure like primary processing facilities, collection centers etc.  So far, 768 projects out of a total of 793 projects have been approved for setting up food processing Industries by the private sector with approved Grants in Aid of Rs 5603 Crores.In order to further increase private sector participation in the sector, Government has taken three major initiatives this year. Firstly, Government has approved the introduction of “Production Linked Incentive scheme” for Food Processing Sector with an outlay of Rs 10,900 Crore to support creation of global food manufacturing champions and support Indian brands of food products in international market. Entrepreneurs in the MSME sector manufacturing innovative and organic products will also be incentivized under the scheme.Secondly, with a view to extend incentives to the private micro food enterprises, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)and Cooperatives, spread all over the country, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing centrally sponsored "PM Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises Scheme"  from the current financial year. The scheme aims to provide financial, technical and business support for upgradation/ setting up of two lakh micro food processing units based on One District One Product (ODOP) approach in a period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 crores. Under the scheme, a total of 137 unique food products/ perishable produce etc have been approved as ODOP for 707 districts of 35 States/ UTs.Thirdly, in the budget speech for 2021-2022, Government has announced expansion of scope of “Operation Greens  scheme” from Tomato, Onion & Potato (TOP) to 22 perishable products, so as to boost value addition in agriculture and allied products and their exports.*****
