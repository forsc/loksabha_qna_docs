                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Yes Sir, the Ministry of Rural Development is presently implementing five welfare schemes for employment generation in order to provide employment to people in rural areas of the country including the State of Maharashtra.  The details in this regard are as follows: – i.	Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS): This is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.  The details expenditure made, State/UT-wise, including the State of Maharashtra under the Scheme is at Annexure-I.ii.	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya –National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM):  This scheme is working to mobalise rural poor women in Self Help Groups (SHGs) and to create additional livelihood opportunities for them through provision of credit, orientation on key livelihood skills and advisory support besides taking up value chain development activities. Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), the sub-scheme under the DAY-NRLM programme supports the SHGs and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector. SVEP develops an eco-system for enterprise development in the rural areas which consists of Community Enterprise Fund (CEF) for enterprise financing, Cadre of Community Resource Persons-Enterprise Promotion (CRP-EP) for providing Business Support Services comprising of preparation of business plans, trainings, market linkages etc., dedicated Block Resource Centre (BRC) for providing all necessary information to entrepreneurs. The Block is the unit of implementation of SVEP. The details of funds sanctioned/released, State/UT-wise, including the State of Maharashtra under the Scheme is at Annexure-II.iii.	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): This is a placement linked skill development programme for wage employment.iv.	Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs): This enables a trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.v.	Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G):  This scheme mandates to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of pucca houses with basic amenities. Under this scheme, it is mandatory to provide support of 90 persondays (95 persondays in hilly states, difficult areas and Integrated Action Plan districts) unskilled wage employment at the current rates to a PMAY-G beneficiary for construction of his / her house in convergence with MGNREGS.  Under PMAY-G, Rural Mason Training (RMT) is implemented to address the issue of less availability of skilled masons in the rural areas so as to ensure quality house construction.  This not only ensures that the houses constructed under PMAY-G are of good quality but also provides livelihood opportunities to the persons who had undergone training.  The workers who have required experience in construction sector are trained in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) mode under the RMT program of the PMAY-G, to facilitate them for formal career progression.Apart from the above mentioned schemes of the Ministry of Rural Development, various other Central Ministries/Departments are also implementing the programmes/schemes for employment generation which are as follows: i.

Presently, the third phase of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 is being implemented. Under PMKVY, STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate.  PMKVY has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the States / UTs popularly known as State- Component of PMKVY. Under the CSCM component of PMKVY, funds are disbursed to NSDC for implementation of the scheme, while under State component, the funds are disbursed to the States/State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) for implementation. It is informed that there is no village wise data captured under the PMKVY scheme. ii.	Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP): Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises is implementing Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth across the country including candidates from villages. The scheme was launched during 2008-09. Under PMEGP, general category beneficiaries can avail of margin money subsidy of 25 % of the project cost in rural areas and 15% in urban areas. For beneficiaries belonging to special categories such as ST/SC/OBC/women/Minorities etc. the margin money subsidy is 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas.  The maximum projects cost is Rs 25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs 10 lakh in the service sector. Since 2018-19, the financial assistance scheme for expansion/upgrading of the existing PMEGP units (for manufacturing units upto 1.00 Cr. and for service/ trading unit upto Rs.25.00 Lakhs with subsidy of 15% for non NER and 20% for NER and hilly state) has also introduced. iii.
