                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (e)  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (E) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*251 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.12.2019 REGARDING “FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES” ASKED BY SHRI SELVAM G AND SHRI SOYAM BAPU RAO, HON’BLE M.Ps.(a)	   The flood management schemes including anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments with their own funds as per their priority. Union Government supplements efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas.Government of India had launched a State Sector Scheme namely “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” during XI Plan for providing financial assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII Plan. For three years period beyond XII Plan, from 2017-18 to 2019-20 FMP scheme has been included as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP)" of Ministry of Jal Shakti. A total of 522 projects with an estimated cost of Rs.13238.36 crore were approved and included under FMP during XI and XII Plan.  Since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance released to States under FMP up till March, 2019 is Rs.5863.95 crore. A Committee under the Chairman, Central Water Commission in the year 2018 has reviewed the 522 projects approved during XI and XII Plan under FMP. As per the report of the Committee, 403 schemes have been physically completed. Implementation of Flood Management Programme during XI and XII Plan has provided a reasonable degree of protection to an area of 3.466 million ha and 26.58 million population.(b)  Major issues/problems encountered while implementing the scheme by State Governments are acquisition of land for the project, litigations, non-release of State Share, inadequate budget allocation which leads to extension of time for completion. Time to time reviews are being held with State Govts/Project Authorities for resolving the bottlenecks of the projects and their expeditious completion. The Committee constituted under Chairman, Central Water Commission in the year 2018 critically examined the status of completion, prioritisation and continuation or otherwise by carrying out joint site visits with concerned State Government officials to the projects.(c)   The Central Assistance released to the States under FMP component of FMBAP during last three years and in the current year is at Annexure-I.(d)  In order to formulate the strategy for flood management works in the entire country and river management activities and works in the border areas for period 2020-2023, a Committee has been constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. Besides, Officials from Government of India, Experts from the field, Principal Secretaries from States of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Punjab, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala are also the members of  the Committee constituted by NITI Aayog. Contd…P/2//2//(e)  Floods are natural calamity and is attributed to various factors like wide variation in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departure from normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion, silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage, snow melts and glacial lake outbursts.  The Government of India has been making regular efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management and it had taken several important actions, including setting up of Various Expert Committees / Task Forces/ Commissions from time to time, which studied the flood problems and recommended suitable flood management measures for implementation by the State Governments. A gist of important initiatives is as under:(i)	Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) was set up at Patna in 1972 to address the flood and erosion problems of Ganga basin States. It has prepared 23 Comprehensive Master Plans for the Ganga Basin States and circulated them to concerned States for implementation. (ii)	Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) was set up in 1976 which submitted its report in 1980 recommending various measures of flood control. (iii)	Brahmaputra Board was set up in 1980 to address the flood erosion problems in the North Eastern States including North Bengal and Sikkim. It has prepared 57 Master Plans and circulated them to concerned States for implementation. (iv)	The Task Force - 2004 on Flood Management / Erosion Control, set up in August, 2004, submitted its Report in December, 2004 recommending immediate, short-term and long-term measures for flood management and erosion control in the States of Assam & neighbouring North-Eastern States, Bihar, West Bengal, Eastern Uttar Pradesh.(v)	The Government of India is having regular dialogue with neighbouring countries viz. Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and China on flood management aspects in India, besides other issues related to water resources.(vi)	As a non-structural measure, Central Water Commission (CWC) has established a flood forecasting network across the country and issues flood forecasts at 325 stations. The level forecasts help the user agencies in deciding mitigating measures like evacuation of people and shifting people and their movable property to safer locations. The Inflow Forecasting is used by various dam authorities in optimum operation of reservoirs for safe passage of flood downstream as well as to ensure adequate storage in the reservoirs for meeting demand during non-monsoon period. (vii)	 The Government of India issued National Water Policy-2012 which emphasizes construction of large storage reservoirs and other non-structural measures for integrated flood management. *****ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to Part (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *251 to be answered on 05.12.2019 regarding “Flood Management Programme”.
