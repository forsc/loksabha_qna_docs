ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c) Since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of potable water to every rural household through tap water connection of the country, including those in North Eastern States, by 2024. Presence of geo-genic contaminants in ground water in few areas, mountainous terrain, scattered rural habitations, drying up of sources in certain pockets, delay in release of the matching State share in some States especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, etc. are few of problems faced in the implementation of the mission in North Eastern States.Under the mission, 30% weightage is assigned for difficult terrains which inter alia include areas under Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP) and 10% weightage is assigned for population residing in SC/ ST dominated areas, while allocating the fund, to prioritize the coverage in these areas. Moreover, 10% of annual allocation of fund under JJM is mandatorily earmarked for NE states including Tribal Sub Plan/ STC component.Further, considering the special category of North Eastern States and for prioritizing the coverage of tap water connection, the fund sharing pattern under JJM is 90:10. Also, apart from annual allocation, an amount of Rs. 145 Crore in 2019-20 and Rs. 143 Crore in 2020-21 was made available to NE States as additional fund to the performing States under the mission for prioritizing coverage of remaining households with tap water connection.*****
