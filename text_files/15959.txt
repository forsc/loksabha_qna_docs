                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry, carries out assessment of forest of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The total forest cover of the country, as per the ISFR 2019 is 7,12,249 km2 which is 21.67% of the total geographical area of the country. This is an increase of 3976 km2 as compared to that of total forest cover in ISFR-2017. State and Union Territory-wise increase in forest cover as per ISFR 2017 and 2019 are given in Annexure-I.Compensatory levies collected by the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and/or Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 were deposited in the nationalized banks under the Ad-hoc Compensatory Afforestation Funds Management and Planning Authority (Ad-hocCAMPA); and were released to the respective State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for the conservation and development of the forest and wildlife in accordance with the Guidelines on State Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (State CAMPA) issued by MoEF letter dated 15.07.2009.The funds received by the Ad-hoc CAMPA during the last three years is annexed at Annexure-II andthe funds released by the Ad-hoc CAMPA to the States/UTsis annexed at Annexure-III.(b) & (c) Yes sir. The Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act, 2016 has come into force with effect from 30.09.2018. This has resulted in establishment of twospecial funds out of the compensatory levies, namely the “National Compensatory Afforestation Fund” (National Fund) under the public account of India and the “State Compensatory Afforestation Fund-…… (name of State)” under public account of such State. 10% share of the compensatory levies is deposited in the National Fund and 90% share in the National Fund.After commencement of the Act, Rs 47436.18 crore has been disbursed to various States (Annexure-IV).(d) & (e) Consistent efforts of Central Government, State Governments and Union Territory Administrations under different schemes and programmes have yielded good results, which is evident from the fact that the forest cover has stabilized and has been constantly increasing over the years. A study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA has also stated that India and China are leading the increase in greening on land. ***
