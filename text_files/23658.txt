                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	India started external supplies of Made-in-India COVID19 vaccines on 20 January 2021. Supplies are being undertaken in the form of grant, commercial sales by the manufacturers and through GAVI’s COVAX facility. India, as most other countries, is implementing its COVID-19 vaccination programme in a phased manner. Taking into account domestic production and requirements of the phased roll out of national vaccination programme, a decision was taken to supply to foreign countries on a bilateral-grant or commercial basis. The supply to GAVI’s COVAX facility is an obligation since India is a member of this multilateral body and also a recipient of vaccines from this body.Country-wise details for supply of vaccines till 21 March 2021 are enclosed. <pre>Supplies till 21 March 2021 (In lakhs)Sl.
