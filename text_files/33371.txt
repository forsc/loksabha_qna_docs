ANSWER




                                                        (a) Yes Sir, In order to understand the sectoral and geographical spread of skill requirement/gaps and incremental human resource requirement across the sectors, studies have been undertaken by the Government through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership (PPP) entity. The Environment Scan of 2016 updated the findings of the earlier Reports by factoring in the likely impact of major flagship initiatives of the Government on human resource requirement. The study estimated incremental human resource requirement of 103 million during 2017-2022 across 24 high priority sectors.The table giving sector-wise distribution of the same is in Annexure I. Considering the overlap in the human resource requirement across a number of sectors, the unique number for incremental demand would be 109.7 million by 2022, wherein the top 10 sectors would account for 80% of this requirement. State-wise incremental human resource requirement has also been worked out according to which incremental demand is assessed at 120.33 million by 2022, as compared to 2013.However, as estimated by the Ministry on the basis of the above studies, incremental training need across 34 sectors stands at 128.21 million during 2017-22. Sector-wise distribution of the same is in Annexure II.The Government had also engaged various organizations including Accenture, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) through the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for conducting district-level skill gap studies for different states in India. The studies were conducted in 443 districts. They contain information on district-wise skill gaps over 2013-17 and 2017-22. The overall objective of the State-wise studies was to assess the district-level skill gaps in the concerned States, both in terms of numbers and the required skills and competence. The studies provide information on the skills needed and the skill gaps in various sectors across districts in the state. They help to understand the skill requirements and opportunities within the states. Further, Human Resource and Skill Requirement Study for 21 Coastal Districts of India were prepared for: Sagarmala, Ministry of Shipping.(b)	No such estimate can be done for any distant future since such requirements depend on the nature of technology and changing patterns of demand of products and services that ultimately reflect itself in the changes in demands for skills. However, on the basis of the population, an estimate was done at the time of framing the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015. And the total need for skilling in the country in 2022 as summarized as follows (in Appendix –II of National Policy of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015):(in million)a) RPL, reskilling, upskilling and skilling of the existing workforce especially below 45 years of age	298.25b) Skilling for new entrants over 2015-22	104.62Total	402.87 (c) Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing various schemes across the country including Tamil Nadu:S.No.	Schemes	Objective1	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), with the objective to train candidates across India, including the state of Rajasthan.
