ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b): Import of Arecanut has taken place mainly from Sri Lanka and Indonesia during the last two years and current year. Country wise and year wise import data of areca nut for the last two years is annexed. (c)	& (d) To protect the farmers, Government raised the Minimum Import Price from Rs.162/ to Rs.251/-per kg in the month of January, 2017. Representations were received regarding large scale import of areca nut despite imposition of MIP, thus hurting the domestic farmers/growers. To address the issue, Government further amended the import policy of areca nut in July, 2018 by prohibiting its imports below the MIP of Rs.251/- per KG. The government has also taken, inter alia, the following steps to alleviate the problems of domestic areca nut growers:(i)	The import duty of Arecanut has been fixed at 100%. (ii)	Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has advised its field offices to stringently adhere to the quality standards of arecanut before clearing the import consignments. Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Standards has been asked to formulate standards for Arecanut.  This has been done with a view to prevent inferior quality Arecanut from entering Indian market and destabilizing the domestic prices.  (iii)	For import from our FTA partners, Customs authorities have been advised to check the Rules of Origin with utmost care so as to ensure that Arecanut grown in countries other than SAARC is not imported through our neighbouring countries taking advantage of low import duty under SAFTA.  **** Annex	India''s Imports of Arecanuts, item-wise & country-wise, for the last two financial years                                                     (2017-18 to 2018-19) and the current financial year 2019-20 (upto April, 2019) ITCHS	Item Description	Country	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20 (upto April, 2019)							Quantity (TON)	Value (Mill.
