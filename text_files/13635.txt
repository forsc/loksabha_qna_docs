                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	 Yes, Sir. In the State of Andhra Pradesh, four cities have been selected to be developed as Smart Cities, viz. Amaravati, Kakinada, Tirupati and Visakhapatnam. (b)	Kakinada and Visakhapatnam were selected in Round-1 of city challenge process in January, 2016, Tirupati in Round-2 in September, 2016 and Amravati in Round-3 in June, 2017. Vijayawada was not proposed to be developed as Smart City by the State Government. (c)	 The First Round of the Smart City Challenge was held in 2015 and the top 20 cities belonging to 12 States, including Andhra Pradesh, were selected. In order to spread the message of urban transformation in all parts of the country and to provide an opportunity to all the States/Union Territories (UTs), a special Fast-Track Round was provided to 23 States/UTs to upgrade their proposals whose cities were not selected in the first list of 20 cities. Thus, the highest scoring cities in each of these 23 States/UTs were advised to submit their upgraded proposals.  The ranking of these cities was arrived at through a rigorous process of evaluation by a panel of experts and the selection of 13 cities was done on merit. As 2 cities of Andhra Pradesh were already selected in Round-1, the State of Andhra Pradesh was not included in Fast-Track Round.(d) & (e) There is no such proposal under consideration of this Ministry.                                             ….
