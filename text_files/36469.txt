ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND 	FAMILY WELFARE	(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e) National Health Policy 2017 recommends availability of 2 beds per 1000 population. However, the number of beds in public health facilities are guided by the population norms mentioned in the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) laid down by the Government of India. As per IPHS norms, Primary Health Centre with 6 indoor/ observation beds is to be established to cover 20,000 to 30,000 population, Community Health Centres with 30 beds to cover population of 80,000-1,20,000, Sub-District Hospitals with 31-100 beds to cover population of 1,00,000 – 5,00,000 and District Hospital with 101-500 beds to cover population upto 30,00,000. As per National Health Profile 2018, India had 1 bed per 1844 population or 0.54 beds per 1000 population. As per national Health Profile 2021, India has 8,25,235 beds or 0.6 beds per 1000 population.Public Health and Hospitals is a State Subject, the primary responsibility for strengthening of health care systems lies with the respective State/UT Governments. However to address the gaps in the availability of hospital beds, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India provides financial and technical support to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including availability of adequate hospital beds based on the proposals submitted by States/UTs in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs). Government of India provides approval for the proposals in the form of Record of Proceedings (RoPs) as per norms & available resources.In addition, under CSS component of India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package - Phase-II (ECRP-II), Government of India provides support to the States/UTs for provision for establishing District Paediatric Units (including Oxygen Supported beds, ICU beds, HDU beds); to increase the availability of ICU beds in public health facilities and for augmenting beds at Sub Health Centres, Primary Health Centres & Community Health Centres in rural, peri-urban and tribal areas. Further, PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) with an outlay of Rs. 64,180 crores envisages increased investments in public health and other health reforms to provide better access to health in rural areas and one of the objective of the Mission is addition of new critical care-related beds at district level hospitals.
