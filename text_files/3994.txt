(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	As per second India Meteorological Department (IMD) Long Range Forecast, released on 31.05.2019, rainfall over the country as a whole for the 2019 South-West Monsoon Season (June to September) is likely to be NORMAL (96% to 104% of the Long Period Average). However, advisories have been issued to all States/Union Territories before the onset of Monsoon 2019 season for reviewing the States’ preparedness in managing any weather related contingency for mitigating the adverse impacts of an aberrant monsoon. They have been advised to update/fine-tune the District Agriculture Contingency Plans; to tie-up the availability of seeds and other inputs for implementing the Contingency Plans; to select suitable crops and cultivars for promoting less water consuming crops; to promote agronomic practices for conservation of moisture; to make necessary arrangements for life saving irrigation;  to restore irrigation infrastructure; to make use of technological interventions towards water conservation; to extend support to farmers in the form of inputs, credit & extension and to sensitize field functionaries of State Agriculture Departments for effective implementation of contingency measures. Progress of Monsoon and Area coverage etc. are monitored weekly through Weather Watch Group meetings as well as video conferencing, advising the States to take steps according to the prevailing situation. District Agriculture Contingency Plans for 648 districts have been prepared by Central Research Institute for Dry land Agriculture (CRIDA) to mitigate the situation in drought affected areas. There is a provision of distribution of seeds of contingency crops such as pulses, millets, oilseeds, which are drought hardy and survive with minimal available water in rain fed/ drought affected areas under National Food Security Mission (NFSM).******
