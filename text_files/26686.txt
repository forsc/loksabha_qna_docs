                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a):	Yes sir.  As reported by Ministry of Mines, both the districts are perennially landslide-prone. Landslides of varying magnitudes are triggered predominantly by monsoon rainfall. As per Geological Survey of India  (GSI)’s  National  Landslide  Geodatabase,  Darjeeling and Kalimpong-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.2301 FOR 03.08.2021 districts of West Bengal contain about 15% and 22% areas as “highly susceptible to landslides” respectively.   (b), (c) & (d):	GSI has conducted varied types of scientific studies on landslides in the Himalayan regions, including Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts.  Between 2016 and 2020, GSI has published five region-specific Landslide Compendiums as GSI’s Special Publications, covering all the landslide-prone regions in the country, including the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalayas. As part of the baseline and national-level landslide data generation, GSI had launched a nation-wide national mapping program – National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) in 2014. Under NLSM, GSI has completed 1: 50,000 scale landslide susceptibility mapping of the entire landslide-prone areas of Northwest Himalayas and the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalayas, which covered both the Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts   in   West   Bengal.   All   the   above   vital   GIS-enabled   geodata  are   uploaded   on   GSI’s   Bhukosh   Map   Portal (http://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/Bhukosh/Public).  (e):	As informed by the State Government of West Bengal, Landslide Management Plan is included in the District Disaster Management Plans (DDMP) for Darjeeling and Kalimpong Districts.  -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.2301 FOR 03.08.2021National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has approved Landslide Risk Mitigation Scheme (LRMS) having financial outlay of Rs. 43.92 Crore under Improving Disaster Risk Governance of State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs) / District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) in July, 2019 to provide financial and technical support to landslide prone States for site specific landslide mitigation.  It is a pilot scheme to demonstrate benefits of landslide mitigation measures along with landslide monitoring, awareness generation, capacity building / training etc.  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) have been signed with SDMAs of the States of Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland and Uttarakhand for implementation of the scheme and Rs. 29.60 Crore have been released to these States. In addition, Fifteenth Finance Commission has also recommended an allocation of Rs. 750 crore from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) for seismic and landslide risk reduction in the Himalayan region and for all the States in north-east during the next five years.*******
