ANSWER




(a):  National Informatics Centre (NIC), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has developed an indigenous solution Sandes for instant messaging communication. Sandes is an Open source based, Secure, Cloud enabled platform hosted on Government Infrastructure so that the strategic control remains with GOI.  It has features like one to one and group messaging, file and media sharing, audio video call and e-gov application integration etc. The solution is being used by the Govt. and is available at Google Play Store and App Store . (b) and (c):  The social media platforms are intermediaries as defined in the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. In order to ensure accountability of social media platforms to users and enhanced user safety, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the Act that specifies the due diligence to be followed by all the intermediaries including the social media intermediaries. The Rules also prescribe additional due diligence to be followed by Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMI) like Facebook, Twitter, etc.These Rules are available on Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) website https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Intermediary_Guidelines_and_Digital_Media_Ethics_Code_Rules-2021.pdf(d) : Does not arise.*******
