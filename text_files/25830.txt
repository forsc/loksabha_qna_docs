STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY OF PARTS (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 143 (3rd POSITION) FOR ANSWER ON 29.7.2021 REGARDING PROJECTS IN KARNATAKA UNDER SMART CITIES MISSION(a) to (e) Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities. In Karnataka, 7 Cities, viz. Belagavi, Bengaluru, Davangere, Hubbali-Dharwad, Mangaluru, Shivamogga & Tumakuru have been selected for development as Smart Cities.  Mysuru is not one of the selected Smart Cities under SCM. Smart Cities in Karnataka have tendered out 817 projects worth ? 17,164.45  crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 786 projects worth ? 15,364.84 crore (89%); out of these, 449 projects worth ? 4,255.34 crore (25%) have been completed. The Smart Cities are expected to complete their projects within five years from their date of selection. Government of India has released ? 1,721 crore for Smart Cities of Karnataka, out of which, these Smart Cities have already utilized ? 1,563 crore (91%). The details of projects, funds released by Central Government and utilization thereof by Smart Cities in Karnataka, are given in Annexure-I.There is no proposal to include other tier-2 cities of Karnataka under SCM. Implementation of the SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. These SPVs are registered under the Companies Act, 2013 and are jointly owned in 50:50 ratio by respective State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) & Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Ministry regularly interacts with the States/UTs & Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Besides, the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities also benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions. At the State level, High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary has been established.  At the national level, the implementation of SCM is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Besides, MoHUA nominee Directors on the Boards of SPVs monitor the progress in respective cities on a regular basis. The Geo-spatial Management Information System (GMIS) of the SCM collates project data in real-time; thus, enabling effective monitoring of project progress.Smart City SPVs are responsible for appraisal, approval, implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of projects which are part of their Smart City Plans. They hire consultants and human resources as per their need, tender projects and award contracts following due processes of bidding.                                   *****
