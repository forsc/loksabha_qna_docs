                                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE               MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a): 	No Sir. Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has informed that flats offered in Vasant Kunj under DDA Housing Scheme 2019 had received an overwhelming response. However the flats offered in Narela did not get the adequate response. The details are annexed.(b): 	DDA has further informed that as per the DDA Housing Regulations, 1968 the property allotment committee is not responsible for looking after day to day maintenance of the flats. However this task is assigned to a Registered Agency or local Resident Welfare Association (RWA) of the  cluster of flats (pockets) concerned. It is mandatory for each allottee to become member of such RWA.(c):  DDA has informed that one RWA/ Registered Agency namely ''E1 Vasant Kunj Resident Welfare Association'' has been recognized/identified for day to day maintenance for the flats at Mehrauli-Mahipalpur road, Vasant Kunj allotted under DDA Housing Scheme 2019.(d):	DDA has informed that the allottees are aware that they will have to mandatorily become a part of the Registered Agency as it is a pre-condition of allotment as mentioned in the condition no. 14 of DDA Housing Scheme 2019 brochure.  The procedure for formation and registration of RWA are governed by DDA (Management and Disposal of Housing Estates) Regulations 1968 and is at https://www.mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/mang_dis_housing.pdf.(e):	DDA has informed that registration application of two RWAs/agencies is pending.  Further, no application for recognition of RWA  for flats situated in Mehrauli- Mahipalpur road, Vasant Kunj (allotted under DDA Housing Scheme 2019) is pending.                                     *****
