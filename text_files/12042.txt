SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	& (b) With a view to boost textiles sector in the country, government has initiated two important steps which were part of Budget Announcement in Lok Sabha on 01.02.2020.

Technical textiles are textiles which are used for their functional properties, rather than for aesthetics or comfort. There are a large varities of technical textiles some of which are used in important applications such as agriculture, health and hygiene, medical applications, soil and water conservation, roads and highway, railways, airports, sea-ports, defence, protection of personnel in military, para-military, petrochemical/chemical industries, safety of fireman etc. The aim of the Mission is to position India as a major producer, consumer and exporter of technical textile products in the world map, therefore boosting its economy and technological capability.ii) Abolition of anti-dumping duty on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), which is a       critical input for man-made textile fibre and yarns. Its easy availability and competitive pricing is desirable to unlock the immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator. 	In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry. These schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country. In order to support the growth and modernization of the textile sector including Handlooms and Handicrafts in the country, the government has been implementing several schemes, such as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crores to boost employment generation and exports particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.In order to encourage and develop handloom and handicraft sectors, the government has been implementing several key programmes and schemes for these sectors. For the handloom sector, which is an unorganised sector, development support is provided under National Handloom Development Programme, Handloom Weavers’ Comprehensive Welfare Scheme (HWCWS), Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme and Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS) for basic inputs, looms and accessories, design development, infrastructure development, marketing of handloom products etc. For the Handicrafts sector, Government is implementing the National Handicraft Development Programme and the Comprehensive Handicrafts Cluster Development Scheme for providing support on design, technology upgradation, infrastructure development, research and development, market support etc. to handicrafts clusters in the country.  These schemes include subsidies and incentives for the growth of the textile sector.****
