ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (d): As per National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020), the approach to equity and inclusion must be common across school and higher education. NEP 2020 inter-alia provides that public and private schools are to be assessed and accredited on the same criteria, benchmarks, and processes, emphasizing online and offline public disclosure and transparency. NEP 2020 also proposes similar standards of audit and disclosure as a ''not-for-profit'' entity to all the education institutions. Surpluses, if any, will be reinvested in the educational sector. Similarly, in higher education, all HEIs - public and private - shall be treated on par observing common guidelines.*******
