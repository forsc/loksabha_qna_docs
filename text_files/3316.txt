Details of flights cancelled by airlines during January 2019 to May 2019 are at Annexure-A.;;(b) Cancellation of flights leads to various hardships to the travelling passenger;(c) To reduce inconvenience caused to the passengers, this Ministry has released the Charter of passenger rights on 27.02.2019 which has the provisions for regulation in case of flight delays, flight cancellations, boarding denied due to overbooking, flight diversions, cancellation charges, lost/ delayed/ damaged baggage or cargo etc. The airlines are required to inform the passengers of the cancellation at least two weeks before the scheduled time of departure and arrange alternate flight/refund as acceptable to the passenger. In case the passengers  are informed of the cancellation less than two weeks before and up to 24 hours of the scheduled time of departure, the airlines are required to offer an alternate flight or refund the ticket, as acceptable to the passenger. For passengers who have not been informed or missed the connecting flight booked on the same ticket number of an airline, the airlines shall either provide alternate flight as acceptable to the passenger or provide compensation in addition to the full refund of air ticket in accordance with the following provisions:;(i) INR 5,000 or booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel charge, whichever is less for flights having a block time of up to and including 01 hour;(ii) INR 7,500 or booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel charge, whichever is less for flights having block time of more than 01 hour and up to and including 02 hours; ;(iii) INR 10,000 or booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel charge, whichever is less for flights having a block time of more than 02 hours.;Additionally, the airline shall provide them facilities at the airport in accordance with the passenger charter in the event they have already reported for their original flight and whilst they are waiting for the alternate flight. ;;(d) No such proposal is under consideration in this Ministry.
