During 2019 (up to 12.07.2019) the Supreme Court Collegium has recommended 9 proposals for appointment of High Court Judges as Chief Justices in various High Courts. Out of which 7 Judges have been appointed as Chief Justices in the High Courts of (i) Chhattisgarh, (ii) Delhi, (iii) Himachal Pradesh, (iv) Karnataka, (v) Meghalaya, (vi) Rajasthan and (vii) Telangana.Two proposals for appointment of High Court Judges as Chief Justices of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh High Court are under various stages of processing as per provisions of the Memorandum of Procedure(MoP). 	As per MoP, initiation of proposal for appointment of Chief Justice of the High Courts vests with the Chief Justice of India. Filling up of vacancies of judges/Chief Justices in High Courts is a continuous, consultative and integrated process between the Executive and the Judiciary, as it requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities.
