As per the biennial edition of India State of Forest Report (ISFR) of Forest Survey of India (FSI), ISFR 2015(updated), the forest and tree cover increased by 4902.6 square kilometre (sq km) over 2013 assessment while as per ISFR, 2017, the forest and tree cover has increased by 8021 sq km. of total forest and tree cover as compared to that of ISFR, 2015(updated). A study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA has also stated that India and China are leading the increase in greening on land. ***
