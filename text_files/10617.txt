The City of Ujjain was selected to be developed as Smart City in Round-2 in September, 2016. A total of 5,151 projects at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,05,018 crores have been proposed by the 100 selected smart cities in their Smart City Proposals (SCPs). As per Smart Cities Mission Statement and Guidelines, the Central Government proposes to give financial support to the extent of Rs. 48,000 crore over five years i.e. an average of Rs. 500 crore per city over the Mission period. An equal amount on a matching basis, is to be provided by the State/Urban Local Bodies. Apart from these, around Rs. 42,028 crore (21%) is expected from convergence with other Missions, Rs. 41,022 crore (21%) from PPP, around Rs. 9,843 crore (4.8%) from loans, Rs. 2,644 crore (1.3%) from own resources and remaining from other sources.The SCP for the Smart City of Ujjain is for 45 projects amounting to Rs. 1924 crore.
