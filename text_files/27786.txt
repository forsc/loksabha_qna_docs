                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA)   (a):       Sickle Cell Disease is a genetic blood disorder affecting tribal population in Central, Western and Southern India. (b):      The Ministry of Tribal Affairs had given funds for screening of tribal students in collaboration with ICMR. Workshops have been conducted in States in collaboration with Department of Biotechnology for mapping of incidences of Sickle Cell Trait. Out of the 1,13,83,664 persons screened as reported by various States, about 8.75% (9,96,368) tested positive (Trait –949057, Disease – 47311). State wise details are at Annexure 1. However, State wise prevalence rate of sickle cell disease among the tribal population is not known in a definite manner as no such database is maintained centrally. There are certain studies undertaken by ICMR showing that the prevalence across the country is 5-34% (as per document on Sickle Cell Anaemia Control Program published by the state government of Gujarat).(c):       Public Health is a state subject and Ministry of Health and Family welfare is the sectoral ministry for all health issues, including sickle cell.  National Health Mission has prepared a comprehensive guideline to control and prevent Haemoglobinopathies, including Sickle Cell Disease, and has disseminated the same to the states. This includes prenatal diagnosis ,counseling and setting up of early intervention centers to prevent and treat the complications arising from the disease. At present there is no permanent cure for the disease.  However with good  management of disease, severity and complications can be curtailed to improve the quality of life and life span of the people suffering with the disease. In consultation with Department of Health Research, Ministry of Tribal Affairs has circulated advisories on Sickle Cell Disease with a protocol for premarital counseling of people with sickle cell trait (carrier). A total of about Rs. 60.00 Crore has been released to the States seeking grants to tackle the Sickle Cell Anemia, including screening.  State wise details for fund released is at Annexure 2. Further, details of various projects undertaken by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs are as under:  (i)  Sickle Cell Disease Support Corner (https://scdcorner.in/) has been developed in collaboration with Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute, to create a database of individuals with SCD or trait in the tribal populations; to connect these individuals to welfare schemes, disease-specific healthcare services and validated health information and to enable data-driven policy insights and strategic inputs. The issue has been inter-alia taken up with Chief Secretary(s) vide D.O. letter dated 18.06.2021 regarding compilation of SCD data at state level. (ii)  TRI Division of MoTA has sanctioned a research study program to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on sickle cell disease wherein the organization is required to prepare treatise on SCD for training of trainers in medical colleges and modules for training of medical officers at district hospitals and integrated center for hemoglobinopathies and hemophilia. Project will also cover 4-5 workshops for training of trainers. As on date, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has prepared draft modules and these have been scrutinized by Technical Expert Group (TEG) comprising of experts in the field. Modules have now been forwarded to Directorate General Of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for their comments. (iii)   Integrated Sickle Cell Anemia Research Program "I-SCARP” in Nandurbar district, Maharashtra : TRI Division has given this project to Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana, S-Vyasa University, Bangalore and INFOMED, Ahmedabad. The project primarily aims to explore naturopathy and yogic methods for curing sickle cell anaemia disease and it is ongoing.
