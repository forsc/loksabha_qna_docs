                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA )(a): The Government is implementing the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana(PMAGY) since 2009-10 for integrated development of Scheduled Castes (SCs) majority villages. The scheme was started on pilot basis in 1000 villages and further extended to 1500 villages in 2014-15. Since 2018-19, PMAGY is being implemented as a continuous scheme with revised implementation guidelines. Prior to 2018-19, the works were selected to be carried out in the selected villages as per their needs and priority of the village. Since 2018-19, the works are to be carried out to saturate the infrastructure gaps against predefined socio-economic monitorable indicators, identified through a comprehensive need assessment exercise in the selected villages.   (b) & (c): The scheme is being implemented in the States/Union Territory of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand. The District Level Convergence Committee, headed by the District Collector with members from  other concerned Departments, is the final authority to approve the Village Development Plans (VDPs) which have details of works to be carried out in the selected villages. Under this scheme the entire funds under ‘Gap-filling’ component are released from the Central Government. However, the State Governments are expected to converge at least 3 to 4 times of Gap filling funds from other Centrally Sponsored schemes and State schemes or even as State share, so as to saturate the villages with basic infrastructure and services.  (d): An amount of Rs.45.82 cr. in 2019-20 and Rs.40.08 cr. in 2020-21, have been released to  Chhattisgarh by the Government.(e): No, Sir.(f) Does not arise, in view of part (e) above.***
