                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a):	As per the Indian Council of Medical Research’s Cancer Registry Data Report on “National Cancer Registry Programme Report,  2020”, the estimated number of cancer cases in the country for 2020 by state/UT wise is enclosed in Annexure I.(b):	Health is a state subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments. National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio vascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM) with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion, awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. Under NHM, support is provided to States/UTs through their annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) for primary and secondary health care needs. The Central Government hospitals namely All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, Safdarjung Hospital and Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Lady Harding Medical college and hospitals in Delhi are providing the cancer treatment. 	To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government has introduced Tertiary Cancer Care Centre (TCCC) Scheme. So far, 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved under the TCCC scheme. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new 22 AIIMS that are being set up and also in many other Institutions being upgraded under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana, and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also some important steps in the direction of strengthening tertiary level services for Cancer. (c) to (f):	Health is a state subject and the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer. The objectives of NPCDCS, being implemented by central Government under NHM for interventions upto the district level, include awareness generation for cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer, the focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral. A population level initiative of prevention, control and screening for common Non Communicable Disease (NCDs) including cancer has also been rolled out in 697 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Under this initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs, including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical. It is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres.	To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases, including cancer, 639 NCD Clinics at District level and 5148 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio vascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS).	The treatment in Government hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Under NHM, essential drugs and diagnostics are provided free of cost in public health facilities. 	Treatment of various cancers is also covered under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) at a number of designated and empanelled hospitals.	Quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all under “Jan Aushadhi Scheme in collaboration with the State Governments. Also, AMRIT (Affordable Medicine and Reliable Implants for Treatment) Pharmacy stores have been set up in hospitals.  Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. Deendayal outlets have been opened at institutions/hospitals with an objective to make available cancer drugs at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtrya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.
