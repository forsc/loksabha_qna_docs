ANSWER




(a) to (c) : The number of children in need of care and protection under Sec 2(14) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 which are supported under Child Protection Services Scheme – Mission Vatsalya is 90,584 (as on 31.03.2021).  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 establish a framework for rehabilitation and shelter of children in need of care and protection and in difficult circumstances.  Further, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme namely Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme under which support is provided to States and UT Governments for delivering services for children in need of care and difficult circumstances. The Child Care Institutions (CCIs) established under the CPS scheme support inter-alia age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. The Ministry also issued advisories and guidelines for encouraging COVID appropriate behaviour, monitoring of Child Care Institutions and coping strategies during COVID times for ensuring regular supply of food, water etc., to the children living in CCIs.  A responsibility matrix defining role of primary duty holders at all levels from State to Panchayati Raj Institutions was also shared with States/UTs. (d) : In view of above, question does not arise.   *****
