                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI) (a) & (b):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.  However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments towards equipping and modernizing of their police forces, by providing financial assistance under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’ [erstwhile scheme of Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF)].   Under this scheme, the-2-L.S.US.Q. NO.1244 FOR 27.07.2021 States have been provided central assistance for acquisition of advanced weaponry such as INSAS Rifles & AK series rifles; all types of intelligence equipment including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),  Night Vision Devices (NVDs), CCTV Surveillance system & body worn camera systems; modern communication equipment and state-of-the-art equipment for  security / training / forensics / cybercrime / traffic policing. Further, ‘construction’ and ‘purchase of operational vehicles’ are permitted in the insurgency affected north-eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts. The State Governments are free to include proposals in accordance with their strategic priorities and requirements. (c) & (d):	The Government has received State Action Plan of Maharashtra for the year 2021-22 under the scheme  and the same has been approved by the High Powered Committee (HPC) constituted for this purpose. The figures of allocation and release of assistance to the Government of Maharashtra during the last three years under this scheme  are as below:(Rs. in crore)Year	Allocation	Release2018-19	51.00	9.58 2019-20	47.11	65.982020-21	47.11	0.00-3-L.S.US.Q. NO.1244 FOR 27.07.2021For the year 2018-19, released funds include funds released to Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) for supply of weaponry and funds for Student Police Cadet programme also. Release for the year 2019-20 include  Rs. 32.03  crore for implementation of Mega City Policing Action Plan.  During these 3 years, released amount out of allocated funds was less than allocation on account of non utilisation of funds/non-submission of Utilization Certificates(UCs) in respect of funds released during earlier years. *****
