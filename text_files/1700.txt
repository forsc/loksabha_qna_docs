ANSWER




                                                        FINANCE MINISTER(a): As per inputs received from Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the bank-wise NPA details as on 31.3.2019 (provisional data for the financial year ending March 2019) with respect to global operations of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) are at Annex.As per RBI data on global operations, aggregate gross advances of SCBs increased from               Rs. 25,03,431 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 68,75,748 crore as on 31.3.2014. As per RBI inputs, the primary reasons for spurt in stressed assets have been observed to be, inter-alia, aggressive lending practices, wilful default/loan frauds/corruption in some cases, and economic slowdown. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets, revealed high incidence of NPAs. As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn. Primarily as a result of transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, gross NPAs of SCBs, as per RBI data on global operations, rose from Rs. 3,23,464 crore as on 31.3.2015, to Rs. 10,36,187 crore as on 31.3.2018, and as a result of Government’s 4R’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, have since declined by Rs. 86,908 crore to Rs. 9,49,279 crore as on 31.3.2019 (provisional data).(b) and (c): On 12.2.2018, RBI issued a circular on Resolution of Stressed Assets — Revised Framework. Supreme Court, vide its order dated 2.4.2019, held the said circular as non-est, necessitating issue of a revised circular for expeditious and effective resolution of stressed assets. Against this background, RBI has issued on 7.6.2019, “Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets” for early resolution of stressed assets in a transparent and time-bound manner, giving complete discretion to lenders with regard to design and implementation of resolution plans, while providing for disincentives in the form of additional provisioning for delay in implementation of resolution plan or initiation of insolvency proceedings, and making mandatory the signing of an inter-creditor agreement,  providing for majority decision-making by all lenders.***
