ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The average income of agricultural households in the country is estimated by National Statistical Office (NSO) through the ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ conducted from time to time. The first such survey was conducted in rural parts of the country during National Sample Survey 59th round (January 2003- December 2003). Thereafter, a repeat survey was conducted during NSS 70th round (January 2013- December 2013). As per the Survey results, although not strictly comparable, the average monthly income per agricultural household in Bihar is estimated to have increased from Rs. 1810 in 2003 to Rs. 3558 in 2013. State-wise inflation adjusted income estimates are not separately available in the Survey report. 	With a view to increase the profitability of farming and to make agriculture more attractive to farmers, the Government has been reorienting the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centric approach which goes beyond achieving the targeted production. Government has also constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine the issues relating to ‘Doubling of Farmers Income’ and recommend a comprehensive strategy to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 which is available on the Department’s website at http://agricoop.nic.in/doubling-farmers. The Committee recognises agriculture as a value-led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth in farmers’ income, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.  (c) & (d):	Agriculture being a State subject, State Governments take appropriate steps for development of agriculture in their respective States. Government of India, however, supplements their efforts through implementation of various schemes and programmes. The major Centrally Sponsored Schemes implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) in Bihar are Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)- Per Drop More Crop, National Food Security Mission (NFSM), NFSM-Oilseeds and Oil Palm, Rainfed Area Development & Climate Change, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), National Project on Management of Soil Health & Fertility, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), National Project on Agro-Forestry, Sub-Mission on Agriculture Extension, Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material, Sub-Mission on Agriculture Mechanization, Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine, National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture, etc. 	Government of India is also promoting integrated farming systems to supplement agricultural households’ income from traditional crops. Besides, Government has adopted the principle of fixing Minimum Support Prices (MSP) at a level of 50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production of crops. Various measures taken by the Government are aimed at improving net returns to the farmers by enabling them to realize higher yields at lower cost and benefit from better market prices. Though the extent of increase/decrease in income in Bihar during the last five years is not known, the level of foodgrains production in Bihar has increased from 129.06 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 156.93 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 (Fourth Advance Estimates).********
