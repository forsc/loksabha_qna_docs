ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) & (b): States share of central taxes and duties are determined after deducting cesses and surcharges apart from cost of collection of the respective tax. Higher collections in indirect taxes do not necessarily mean lesser share to States. However, it may be mentioned that cesses from part of Consolidated Fund of India and are used for the purpose for which they are levied, which in many cases involves grant to States. For example, the entire GST compensation cess is levied for the purpose of giving compensation to States for loss of revenue due to introduction of GST. Similarly, 100% of Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh and a substantial portion of the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund, Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Nidhi and Madhyamik and Uchchtar Shiksha Kosh is given to States as grants for respective purposes.               The total amount of cess (including surcharge) collected under Indirect Taxes (GST +Non-GST) during the last four years are as under:-                                                                                                 (In Rs. Crore)Tax Head	F.Y 2017-18	F.Y 2018-19	F.Y 2019-20	F.Y 2020-21 (P)Total Cess& Surcharge Collection under Indirect Taxes [GST + Non-GST]	217029.2	267697.6	287402.0	439507.6         Source: Receipt Budget; PrCCA(CBIC)   (P)= Provisional (c) & (d):  Yes Sir.
