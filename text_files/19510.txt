MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that there are discrepancies / deficiencies in the proposal to open a new Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) at Jeypore in Koraput district of Odisha State. The discrepancies / inadequacies have been brought to the notice of district Administration Koraput, Odisha for necessary rectification.     (c) & (d) Opening of Kendriya Vidyalayas is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.  At present 170 KVs (including 2 KVs in Koraput district i.e. Sunabeda and Koraput) are functioning in 117 Aspirational Districts.*****
