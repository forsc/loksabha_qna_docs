                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA)   (a)        COVID-19 vaccination drive has been ongoing across the country since 16th January 2021. Since 21st June 2021, ‘Revised Guidelines for implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program’ have come in effect according to which all citizens irrespective of their income status are entitled to free vaccination.The COVID-19 vaccination drive does not make any discrimination on the basis of gender, socio-economic class or residence etc. However, all efforts have been made to ensure vaccination of people in tribal areas including and not limited to options of registration at Common Service Centres, ‘walk-in registration’ at COVID-19 vaccination centre and ‘Near to Home Vaccination Centres for elderly people and people with disabilities’.The CoWIN portal does not maintain record of religion or caste of the beneficiaries. However, in the 176 identified tribal districts, as on 15th July 2021, a total of 4.81 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. The State/UT-wise details of doses administered is at Annexure-1.(b)        Tribal areas pose additional challenges and hence requires additional focus. Tribal communities are geographically and socioeconomically relatively segregated and have poor access to health care. Accordingly, Government of India has issued a SOP on COVID-19 Containment & Management in Peri-urban, Rural & Tribal areas. (c)        Such centralized data on COVID-19 mortality with Urban/Rural/Tribal breakup is not maintained by the Government.
