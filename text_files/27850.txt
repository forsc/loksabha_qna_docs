District-wise list of operational sugar mills of Uttar Pradesh is at annexure. (b) to (e):   The State Government of Uttar Pradesh has informed that they have decided vide order dated 14th May,2008  to shut down the  Shahaganj unit  (District- Jaunpur) of   Uttar Pradesh State Sugar & Cane Development Corporation Ltd., situated  in Shahganj assembly constituency of Jaunpur district. As further informed by the State Government, the sugar mill was shut down as its operation was unviable due to low crushing capacity (of only 1016 tonnes crushing per day) and as Plant & Machinery was obsolete and mill was incurring huge financial  losses. The State Government of Uttar Pradesh, vide order dated 04 January, 2011 has sold the closed unit to M/s. Wave Industries Ltd.  Now, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneur to revive the closed sugar mill.  It has also been informed by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh that they have no proposal to set up any new sugar mill in Shahganj assembly constituency of Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh.          The Central Government does not setup sugar mill in any part of the Country. Further, sugar industry has been de-licensed w.e.f. 31.08.1998. After de-licensing, the entrepreneurs are free to set up sugar mills in any part of the Country subject to fulfilling the conditions laid down in Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966.  Further, it is the responsibility of the concerned entrepreneur to take steps to re-open/revive a closed sugar mill in case of private sector and Cooperative society concerned in case of cooperative sector. *****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *316 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 10.08.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.Statement showing district-wise number of operational sugar mills in the State of Uttar Pradesh.Sl.No	Name of District	No. of operational Sugar mills1	2	31	Aligarh	12	Ambedkernagar	13	Amroha	34	Ayodhya	25	Azamgarh	16	Budaun	27	Baghpat	38	Balrampur	39	Barabanki	110	Bareilly	511	Basti	312	Behraich	413	Bijnor	914	Bulandshahr	415	Deoria	116	Farrukhabad	117	Gaziabad	118	Gonda	319	Gorakhpur	120	Hapur	221	Hardoi	322	Kashganj	123	Kushinagar	524	Lakhimpur	925	Maharajganj	226	Mau	127	Meerut	628	Moradabad	429	Muzaffarnagar	830	Pilibhit	431	Rampur	332	Saharanpur	633	Shahjahanpur	534	Sambhal	335	Shamli	336	Sitapur	537	Sultanpur	1Total State	120*****
