                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): As a general practice, requests for naming/ renaming of airports are considered based on the recommendations of the concerned State Government, supported by a resolution passed in the respective State Legislative Assembly. No such proposal has been received from the State Government of Gujarat for renaming of Porbandar Airport as ''Kasturba Gandhi Porbandar Airport''.;;(d): Air operations in domestic sector have been deregulated and the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) issued by the Government. It is upto the airline operator to provide air services to a specific place depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. However, with the objective of facilitating / stimulating regional air connectivity especially to  underserved and unserved airports in the country, the Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016. Under the scheme, bids have been received for operation of flights in Keshod-Ahmedabad-Keshod and Keshod-Mumbai-Keshod sectors.;;(e): No scheduled flight operated from Porbandar Airport during the year 2016. SpiceJet has commenced operation of a scheduled flight from this airport on Mumbai-Porbandar-Mumbai sector in 2017 and TruJet is also operating scheduled flight in Ahemedabad-Porbandar-Ahemedabad sector since Winter 2018.  However, no scheduled flight has operated from/to the Keshod Airport during the last three years.
