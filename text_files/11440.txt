ANSWER




(a):	Yes, Sir. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has received applications for upward price revision under para 19 of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013) citing various reasons like increase in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) cost, increase in cost of production, exchange rates etc. resulting in unviability in sustainable production and marketing of the drugs. Based on the recommendation of Standing Committee on Affordable Medicines and Health Products (SCAMHP), ceiling price of shortlisted 21 scheduled formulations of 12 medicines were revised by allowing one time price increase of upto 50% from the present ceiling price in public interest as an exceptional measure by invoking para 19 of DPCO, 2013.(b):	The detail of price revision is as below:Sl. No.	Name of the Scheduled Formulation	Dosage form & Strength	Unit	Revised Ceiling Price(Rs.)(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)1.	BCG vaccine	 	Each Dose	8.752.

It was noted that the twenty one scheduled formulations considered for upward price revision under para 19 of DPCO, 2013 are low priced drugs and have been under repeated price control. Most of these drugs are used as first line of treatment and are crucial to the public health program of the country. Many companies have applied for discontinuation of the product on account of unviability.(e):	In view of reply at (c) & (d) above, the occasion does not arise.*******
