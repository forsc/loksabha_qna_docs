ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a)	& (b):Yes, Sir. It has already been proposed to bring National Litigation Policy with the objective to lay down guidelines for preventing, controlling and reducing litigation, keeping in view the policy & plans of the Government, in a cohesive and organized manner.(c)	:With the objective to reduce litigation, Ministries and Departments like the Railways and Department of Revenue, involved in a high number of litigations have been taking several measures for reducing the number of Court cases.  Ministry of Railways have issued instructions for effective monitoring of Court cases at all levels.  Zonal Railways and Production Units have been asked to take effective steps to reduce the number of cases in which the Government is a party and reduce the burden of courts, expedite finalization of all the cases in all courts at the earliest and to cut down the expenditure in contesting court cases.  For achieving this, emphasis has been laid on effective monitoring of cases by having regular meetings with empanelled advocates, for briefing and necessary directions to be given at the highest level, besides ensuring timely submission of replies, Counter replies and necessary documents to the advocates.			The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) under the Department of Revenue, have issued a slew of instructions and brought in several measures, for reducing litigations and the resultant burden on Courts.  While the CBDT has issued circulars directing the field Officers that pending appeals before Income Tax Appellate Tribunals/High Courts/Supreme Court with tax effect below the specified limits may be withdrawn/not pressed, and in the process facilitating a better and concerted focus on high demand litigations.  CBDT has also clarified to the field officers that appeals should not be filed merely because the tax effect in a particular case exceeds the prescribed monetary limits and the filing of an appeal should be decided strictly on the merits of the case.			Similarly, the field formations under the CBIC have been instructed to withdraw appeals pending in High Courts/Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, where the Supreme Court has decided on identical matter.  Besides, CBIC has also instructed its field formations not to contest further in appeal where the issue has been lost in two stages of appeals.  It has been decided, however, that in cases where it is felt that the issue is fit for further appeal, then on proper justification and approval of the Zonal Chief Commissioner, an appeal can be filed for the third time.  Also, the field formation have been instructed to forward only those SLP proposals where in the issue involves substantial question of law or gross perversity or illegality in the appreciation of evidence. 			In this direction, both the CBDT and the CBIC have also enhanced the threshold monetary limit for filing appeals, the details of which are as follows:CBDT:For filing appeals 	Monetary limitBefore Income Tax Appellate Tribunal	Rs. 50 lakhsBefore High Court	Rs.1 CroreBefore Supreme Court	Rs.2 CroreCBIC:Monetary limits for filing appeals in cases relating to Central Excise and Service Tax 	Monetary limits for filing appeals in cases relating to Customs Before CESTAT	Before High Court	Before Supreme Court	Before CESTAT	Before High Court	Before Supreme CourtRs.50 lakhs	Rs.1 Crore	Rs.2 Crore	Rs. 5 lakhs	Rs.10 lakhs	Rs.25 lakhsThe Government introduced SabkaVishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019 through the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019, which was notified by CBIC to come into force from 1st September 2019. SVLDRS was a resolution-cum-amnesty scheme and one of the main objectives of the scheme was to reduce litigation in various indirect tax enactments, which have been subsumed in the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. The alternative mechanism for the resolution of Inter-Ministerial/Departmental disputes also provide for an institutionalized mechanism for resolution of such disputes, namely, Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of Disputes (AMRD).  This was framed by the Department of Legal Affairs and circulated vide O.M. dated 31.03.2020. This mechanism, applicable to disputes other than taxation disputes, will reduce litigations in courts and resolve the cases outside the court system, where both parties are Govt. Department or where one party is Govt. Department and other is its instrumentalities, (CPSEs/Boards/ Authorities, etc.).	To resolve the commercial disputes between Central Public Sector Enterprises inter-se and CentralPublic Sector Enterprises and Government Departments/ Organizations in place of the earlier ‘Permanent Machinery of Arbitration’, a new scheme, namely, “Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of CPSE Disputes (AMRCD)” evolved by Department of Public Enterprises has been brought into effect w.e.f. 22.05.2018.The Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was amended in 2018 to inter-alia provide for Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement (PIMS) mechanism. Under this mechanism a party which does not contemplate any urgent interim relief in a subject-matter of commercial dispute of specified value of Rs.3 lakh and above has to first exhaust the remedy of PIMS to be conducted by the authorities constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, before approaching the Court.Further for facilitating quick disposal of disputes outside the court systems by way of alternate dispute redressal mechanism of mediation, the Mediation Bill, 2021 has been introduced in the RajyaSabha which inter-alia providing for pre-litigation mediation by the parties. (d)	: In pursuance to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, the Department of Justice has implemented a scheme for setting up 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO. The scheme, which was originally conceived for one year, has been further continued for two more Financial Years, i.e. 2021-22 and 2022-23. This is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) which started in October 2019. As on 28.02.2022, 712 FTSCs including 399 exclusive POCSO Courts are functional in 27 States/UT (Goa is yet to operationalize FTSCs. West Bengal, Andaman & Nicobar Island and Arunachal Pradesh have still not joined the Scheme) which disposed more than 81,400 cases and 1.86 lakh cases pending in FTSCs of 27 States/UTs till February, 2022.As a result of CBIC Instructions F. No.390/Misc/116/2017-JC dated 22.08.2019 regardingthe threshold monetary limit for filing appeals, status of withdrawal of appeals in Supreme Court, High Courts and CESTAT are as under:- Forum	Application filed for withdrawal	Withdrawn	Order awaited for withdrawalSupreme court	218	154	64High Court	824	666	158CESTAT	2240	2003	237Details of discharge certificate (SVLDRS-4) issued under ''Litigation category'' in SVLDRS, 2019 are as under- 	Number of ApplicationsDischarge Certificate Issued by SVLDRS system  Application	51,712Discharge Certificate Issued Manually	18Total	 57,730 	(e): 	Yes, Sir.(f):	As per information available regarding Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC), zone-wise details of pending cases in Supreme Court, High Court and CESTAT for last 02 years are at Annexure.
