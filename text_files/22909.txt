HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.358* FOR 19TH MARCH, 2021(a) and (b):  The Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010 and notified Rules thereunder for registration and regulation of clinical establishments including pathological laboratories.  For grant of registration, every clinical establishment is required to fulfil conditions which among others also include compliance to Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) issued by Centre/State Government from time to time.  So far, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, has issued STGs for 227 medical conditions in Allopathy and 18 conditions in Ayurveda. Treatment guidelines have also been prescribed under various National Health Programmes. The Act, however, does not bestow mandate to fix parameters regarding results of various pathological tests/investigations under medical services.   In fact such parameters are usually defined by consensus of medical experts or professional associations, based on outcomes of clinical studies and are usually prescribed in standard medical textbooks on the respective subjects.(c) to (e) No such incidence has been reported to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
