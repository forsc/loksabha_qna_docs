( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (d):	As per First Advance Estimates for 2020-21 (Kharif Only), total foodgrain production including rice, wheat, pulses and nutria cum coarse cereals in the country is estimated at 144.52 million tonnes.

In order to increase production and productivity of foodgrains, Government has been implementing various schemes viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern Indian (BGREI), Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), etc to attain the production target.Contd….2/--2-	Price fluctuation of agri-produce at any given point of time is dependent on demand, supply, quality, storability of the produce and transportation cost etc. The Government has adopted several developmental policies, programmes and schemes which focus on higher incomes for the farmers of the country. PM-KISAN scheme aims at payment of Rs 6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs 2000/- to the farmers’ families, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY), a pension of Rs. 3000/- is provided to the eligible small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion clauses, on attaining the age of 60 years.  Under ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’, “Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)” amounting to Rs one lakh crore has been created for development of various farm gate infrastructure for enhancement of farmers’ income. With a view to increase the profitability of agriculture sector, Government is implementing several Schemes/ Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Soil Health Card, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), etc.(e):	Yes sir. The Government has taken several steps for improving the post-harvest management to address the problem of farmers’ income.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and State Agricultural Universities have also developed a number of post-harvest equipment and technologies which help in checking post-harvest losses and they also organise relevant trainings. Government through National Institutes of Agricultural Marketing(NIAM), Jaipur and Krishi Vigyan Kendras spread across the country also impart training to stakeholders on skill development and adoption of better post-harvest management practices.
