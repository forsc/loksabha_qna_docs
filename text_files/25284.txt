ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b) Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) NTPC, Kayamkulam was opened in the year 1999-2000 in project sector under the sponsorship or funding by NTPC, Kayamkulam mainly to cater to the educational needs of the wards of the NTPC employees. NTPC authorities at Kayamkulam have conveyed that due to financial constraints as well as less number of wards of NTPC employees, NTPC would be unable to continue the financial support to KV, NTPC Kayamkulam from the academic year 2022-2023. The NTPC authorities at Kayamkulam have further conveyed that NTPC is ready to extend the infrastructural facilities to KVS till a permanent alternate arrangement is made. A request has been made to Ministry of Power to resolve the issue amicably and to decide future course of action for the continuous functioning of KV attached to NTPC in the present location.*****
