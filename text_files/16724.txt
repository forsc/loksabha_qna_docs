The scheme also envisages addressing the critical gaps in the value chain, infrastructure, modernization, traceability, production, post- harvest management and quality control. MPEDA, through its society, the National Centre for Sustainable Aquaculture (NaCSA), is supporting the initiative through formation of village based societies to augment aquaculture and its productivity.(d): MPEDA has also taken many other steps to promote aquaculture production in the country, like increasing the area under coastal aquaculture in coordination with state governments, increase in productivity by enabling adoption of advanced technologies by aqua-farmers, diversification of species, transferring good practices through demonstration programs, addressing quality and traceability issues through a certification scheme, etc.  MPEDA is working in close coordination with Deptt of Fisheries, to promote aquaculture production in the country.(e): The export of marine products has been adversely impacted during COVID-19 period.
