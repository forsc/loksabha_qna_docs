ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors and is generally constant. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability of many regions of the country is much below the national average and may result in water stress / scarce conditions. Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to address water shortage in the country.Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.Contd…P/2//2//Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. A meeting of the State Ministers in-charge of Water Resources, Water Supply and Sanitation was held on 11th June 2019 to review the steps taken by various States on water conservation and the implementation of action plans for dealing with the water supply situation, plan for water harvesting and conservation in convergence with other programmes. State Governments were requested to complete water conservation measures so that large-scale rain water harvesting could be possible in the upcoming monsoon season.Through National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), a centrally sponsored scheme, technical and financial assistance are provided to States for providing safe drinking water in rural areas. The NRDWP has been restructured to make it more competitive, result oriented and outcome based to reduce the slippages and inefficiencies in the rural drinking water supply.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoH & UA) is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. The water supply component includes augmentation of existing water supply system and water treatment plants; rehabilitation of old water supply system; rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water etc. MoH & UA has taken measures aimed at water conservation like issuance of guidelines for Urban Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) and Model Building Bye-Laws (MBBL) for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Urban Development Authorities (UDAs) to implement rain water harvesting and take other water conservation measures. During 2016-17, 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019. Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development, has sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States (except Goa) during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia includes ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for asset less persons, etc.Contd…P/3//3//Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control ground water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf(c)  State-wise details of funds released as central assistance under Watershed Development Component of PMKSY for the years 2009-10 to 2018-19 are given at Annexure.Funds released to States/UTs for implementation of various projects of State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) under AMRUT in the years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-2020 are 2404.19 crore, 3526.49 crore, 5339.07 crore and 1712.47 crore respectively.Funds released to States under NRDWP in the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 are 5875.16 crore, 6968.20 crore and 5466.24 crore respectively.
