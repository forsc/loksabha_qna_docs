ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)	The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) periodically commissions sector level skill gap studies to identify the skill requirements in the country. As per NSDC’s sector-specific reports on Human Resource and Skill Requirements in 24 sectors, India had an employment base of 461.1 million in 2013, which is expected to increase to 581 million by 2022. Thus, during this period, about 120 million people would be added to the workforce in these sectors, who will need fresh skilling. In addition, there is need for constant up-skilling and re-alignment of existing workforce. NSDC had also commissioned a Global Skill Gap study in 2018 in respect of 15 countries including the USA, Japan, the UK, Malaysia and United Arab Emirates, where Indian skilled workers can migrate. (c)	A number of steps have been taken to provide an impetus to skill development in the country. Under PMKVY, short-term training is being provided to the youth through empanelled Training Partners/ Training Centres. An amount of Rs. 74.74 crores has been allocated to the State of Odisha under the State Engagement Component of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020). In addition, model skill centres namely Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) have been envisaged in every district of the country for imparting skill training. As of 19.01.2021, 738 PMKKs have been established across the country including 29 in the State of Odisha. The Ministry has launched the third phase of the scheme, PMKVY 3.0, on 15.01.2021 to train 8.00 lakh people pan India with an outlay of Rs. 948.90 crore, including Rs. 7.05 crore allocated to Odisha under State Engagement Component of PMKVY.	Besides, Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) are being implemented by MSDE to impart skill training to youth of the country including State of Odisha. Under JSS scheme, Rs. 6.8 crore has been released to the State of Odisha during the financial year 2020-21, while under the NAPS scheme, Rs. 96.6 lakh has been allocated to the State.	As far as long-term vocational training through ITIs is concerned, the Ministry is assisting State Governments, including Odisha, in modernization and up-gradation of Government ITIs through schemes like Skill Development in 47 Districts Affected by Left Wing Extremism, Up-gradation of existing Government ITIs into Model ITIs and Skills Strengthening for Industrial Value Enhancement (STRIVE). Amount of Rs. 29.23 crore, Rs. 4.97 crores and Rs. 13.19 crores respectively, have been allocated to the Government of Odisha under these Schemes.In order to enhance employability of trainees graduating from Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), duration of curricula of employability skill has been increased from 110 hours to 160 hours in the first year of ITIs from the academic session 2019-20. In addition, web-based employability skills have been introduced as additional component of 80 hours in the second year courses of ITIs. Similarly, entrepreneurship orientation module of 40 hours integrated training under the Life Skill Course module has been introduced in the short-duration skill training scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).
