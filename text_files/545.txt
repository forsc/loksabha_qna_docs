(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Government of India has been promoting Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) i.e. soil test based balanced and judicious use of fertilizers (Chemical, bio-fertilizers, organics manures like Farm Yard Manure, Compost, Vermi-Compost, Green Manure etc.) to maintain soil health and its productivity through  Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme .  Educating farmers through demonstrations , melas, and trainings is integral part of the scheme and 1947 trainnings, 70 melas, and 3.03 lakh demonstrations have been conducted by states in the last 4 years.	Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is also recommending soil test based use of plant nutrient with 4Rs approach i.e. right quantity, right time, right mode and right type of fertilizer to reduce use of chemical fertilizers and improve soil health and fertility.  In addition, spilt application, use of leaf colour chart, use of slow releasing fertilizers including neem coated urea and growing leguminous crops are also advocated to minimize use of nitrogenuos fertilizers.  ICAR also imparts training, organizes front-line demonstration etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects. ********
