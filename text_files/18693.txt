About 121 Lakh Metric Tons (LMT) of food-grains were allotted to States/UTs for free of cost distribution entailing financial implications of approximately Rs. 46061 Crore. It was extended for a further period of 5 months i.e. up to November 2020.

Further, under the PMGKAY scheme, so far, an amount of Rs.1026.01 crore has also been released to States/UTs including Rajasthan for meeting expenditure towards intra-State movement & handling of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers’ margin.
