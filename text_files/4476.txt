However, in order to complement the efforts of States/UTs, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs is administering a scheme ‘Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH)’ under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), through respective States/UTs.It focuses on providing permanent shelters equipped with basic facilities to the urban homeless. 	Under DAY-NULM funds are allocated to States/UTs including Tamil Nadu in a consolidated manner, out of which appropriate amount is apportioned by States/UTs for Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH), as per their requirements. During FY 2016-17 to 2019-20, a total of Rs. 1450.56 crore was released to States/UTs. The Year-wise and State-wise information is at Annexure-I.	TheState level Project Sanctioning Committee (PSC) is competent to consider and approve proposals for construction, refurbishment and sanction appropriate operations & management (O&M) cost for shelters. 	As reported by States/UTs, during the period, 992 shelters have been sanctioned, out of which, 862 shelters are operational. Remaining are in various stages of construction/refurbishment. The Year-wise and State-wise information of shelters sanctioned and operational is at Annexure-II.(c):	It is the responsibility of concerned States/UTs to map the concentration areas of urban homeless. The guidelines of SUH provide for conducting a systematic third party survey by urban local bodies so as to assess accurately the need for shelters at suitable locations.(d):	The Operational Guidelines for SUH provide that for every one lakh urban population, under the scheme, provision should be made for permanent shelters for a minimum of one hundred persons. Depending upon local conditions, each shelter should preferably cater to 50 or more persons. In exceptional situations, shelters with lesser capacity could also be approved.(e):	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has taken various other initiatives for providing shelters to the urban homeless which include;•	Extending the implementation of SUH to all district headquarter towns and other towns with population of one lakh or more,•	Allowing States/UTs to take buildings on rent for running shelters, as an interim arrangement, •	Uploading details of shelters across the country on DAY-NULM portal,•	Directing the States/UTs to maintain funds for SUH component in a separate head of account and install CCTV camera in shelters to address security issues,•	Geo-tagging of shelters,•	Linking the shelters with colleges/educational institutions, so that the student volunteers can engage with the residents of the shelters to give them a sense of belonging, and•	Making shelters barrier free for the physically challenged shelter residents.                   *****
