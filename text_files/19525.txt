ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a): Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) is implemented all over the country successfully. State/UT-wise details of Number of Children enrolled and Institutions covered under the Scheme during the last three years are given at Annexure-I.(b) & (c): Mid-Day Meal is the entitlement of a child, guaranteed under the National Food Security Act, 2013. In order to enable children to meet their nutritional requirement and safe guard their immunity during closure of schools due to COVID pandemic, Ministry of education issued an advisory to all States & UTs to provide Food Security Allowance to all eligible children in lieu of hot cooked mid-day meal, duly following extant social distancing norms, until the schools are reopened. A total of 6 shortcomings were reported regarding nutritional value of meal and implementation of the said schemes/ programmes have come to the notice of the Government during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also stated that the overall responsibility for providing cooked and nutritious Mid Day Meal to the eligible children lies with State Governments and UTs Administrations.  These cases were referred to the concerned State Governments and UT Administrations for taking necessary action.  As per Action Taken Reports (ATRs) received from States and UTs, action such as issuing warning against the official responsible, terminating the contract of concerned NGOs / Organisations, initiating criminal proceedings and imposing penalties against the defaulting persons / officials / organisations have been taken by the concerned State Governments and UT Administrations.  As per the Action Taken Reports (ATRs) received from States and UTs, the details of these cases and action taken on these shortcomings are given at Annexure-II. *****
