ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND 	FAMILY WELFARE	(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d)	The National Health Mission (NHM) envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs. NHM encompasses its two Sub-Missions, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). The main programmatic components include Health System Strengthening in rural and urban areas, Reproductive-Maternal - Neonatal-Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A), and Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases. There are various health programs, for which support is provided to States/UTs under NHM which includes support for engaging Health Human Resource on contract, National Ambulance Services, Mobile Medical Units, infrastructure strengthening, 24 x 7 Services and First Referral facilities, Prime Minister’s National Dialysis Programme, Biomedical Equipment Maintenance and Management Programme, Free Diagnostics Service Initiative and Free Drugs Service Initiative. National Quality Assurance Standards implementation and related Activities, LaQshya Certification, Mera Aspataal, Kayakalp Award Scheme, Rogi Kalyan Samiti, Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees, creation of 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by transforming the existing Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres.Details of funds allocated and released under NHM to States/ UTs including Maharashtra, Dadar, Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu during the current FY 2021-22 is annexed. Under NHM, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) provides technical and financial support to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems including engaging of health human resource on contract based on the proposals submitted by States/UTs in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs). Government of India provides approval for the proposals in the form of Record of Proceedings (RoPs) as per norms & available resources. As Public Health and Hospitals is a State Subject, all the administrative and personnel matters of health human resources including their salary/ remuneration lies with the respective State/UT Governments including Maharashtra, Dadar, Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu. However, 5% of the total Human Resource (HR) budget is approved as increment to all human resource for health (HRH) engaged under NHM and 3% of the total HR budget is recommended for HR rationalisation within which the State has a discretion to decide the actual increment. The maximum increase in remuneration of any staff in a year is to be within 0% to 15% (based on performance and rationalization). HR rationalization exercise and its principles, including increments, are approved by State Health Society Governing Body (SHS GB). The State have to ensure that increment is approved in such a way that it smoothens the process of HR integration and leads to rationalization of salaries of staff with similar qualification, workload and skills.Further, the data for post-wise salaries of workers engaged in different categories under NHM, is not maintained centrally.
