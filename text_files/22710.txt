ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NITIN GADKARI)(a):	Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) is mandated to facilitate credit guarantee support for collateral free / third-party guarantee-free loans to the Micro and Small enterprises (MSEs), especially in the absence of collateral. It facilitates access to finance for un-served and under-served segments of society and geographies.  (b):	 The State wise details of guarantees covered under the Credit Guarantee Scheme by CGTMSE during Financial Years 2018-19 and 2019-20 are given in Annexure. (c) & (d):	The Credit Guarantee Scheme run by CGTMSE is a demand driven Scheme and the option to take guarantee lies wholly with the Member Lending Institutions (MLIs). It is not mandatory for the MLIs to cover all their MSE loans under the Scheme nor are all loans eligible for coverage. Nevertheless, CGTMSE has  introduced many policy changes such as hybrid security model, inclusion of retail trade activity, increase in the extent of guarantee coverage to 75%, charging guarantee fees on outstanding amount, inclusion of Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), Small Finance Banks (SFBs), Cooperative Banks, etc. to cover more number beneficiaries.
