ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):  Yes, Sir. The tariff of meals served in Mobile Units and Static Units have been revised after a gap of six years vide Railway Board’s Commercial Circular No. 60 of 2019 dated 14.11.2019 and Commercial Circular No. 64 of 2019 dated 12.12.2019 respectively. Details of these Circulars are available at http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,555,737,2153. The tariff of Janta meal remains unchanged. The rationalization of tariff was long overdue as this was last revised in 2012-13. The upward change in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI), as reflected by increases in costs of raw materials/ ingredients and overheads (manpower, fuel, etc) necessitated the revision in tariff.  		However, in view of COVID-19 pandemic and related hygiene issues, Indian Railways has stopped service of cooked food and replaced the same with Ready to Eat (RTE) meals in trains. RTE meals are being sold at Maximum Retail Price (MRP).(d) and (e): It is the continuous endeavour of Indian Railways to provide quality and hygienic food to the passengers. Indian Railways have taken various steps to regularly inspect and ensure the quality of food served to the passengers in Railway establishments. Some of the key steps include use of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras, Quick Response (QR) codes on food packets providing details of the meals, certification from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), customer satisfaction surveys, Third Party Audits of establishments, regular and surprise inspections by Railway officials, etc. There is also a robust system of passenger grievances redressal through Integrated Helpline no. 139, Rail Madad, Twitter handle, CPGRAMS, etc.*****
