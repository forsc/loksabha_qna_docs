Airports Authority of India (AAI) has undertaken work of construction of Interim Terminal Building (ITB) and strengthening of runway for operation of civil flights. The delay in the operationalization of the airport can be attributed to multiple factors such as grant of working permission by IAF, poor performance of the executing agency for runway work etc.; ; (b): The airport is included in the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) and under the second bidding round of the scheme, routes from Darbhanga to Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai have been awarded to M/s SpiceJet.

The airport has been included in the list of un-served airports in RCS-UDAN scheme.
