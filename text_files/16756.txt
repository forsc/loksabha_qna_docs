ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):  Sir, the Directorate of Public Grievances [DPG] in the Cabinet Secretariat has a mechanism to entertain representation from a public complainant who says he is not satisfied with the response received from the concerned Ministry/Department within a reasonable period of time.  However, the average disposal time of grievance has progressively improved over the last six years.  For example, during the COVID pandemic, the exclusive grievance redressal option made available ensured redressal of every grievance at an average disposal time of 1.4 day. (c):  The number of public grievances received, actually redressed and pending for redressal during the last three years are given below :-Year	Received	Actually redressed	Pending2017	18,66,124	17,73,020	7,55,9522018	15,86,415	14,98,519	8,43,8482019	18,67,758	16,39,120	10,72,486*****
