                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is being implemented since 2011 in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs), and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty. The programme aims to ensure that at least one woman member from each rural poor household (about 9-10 crore) is brought into women SHGs and their federations within a definite time frame. The programme is being implemented in all the States and Union Territories, except Delhi and Chandigarh. (b) In Gujarat, about 36.53 lakh rural households are likely to be covered under DAY-NRLM by the financial year 2023-24. The identification of households is based on the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) (deprived and auto-included households) data and households identified through the process of Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP). Gujarat State has mobilized 26.03 lakh rural households under the Scheme till 30th June 2021, i.e. 71% of the total targeted households.(c) DAY-NRLM is being implemented in all 248 blocks of 33 districts that includes tribal areas of Gujarat. As on 30th June 2021, a total of 7,67,625 women from Scheduled Tribe (ST) households are mobilised into 73,191 Self Help Groups (SHGs).*******
