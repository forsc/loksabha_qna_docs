ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): Estimates of Employment and Unemployment are obtained through labour force surveys conducted by the National Statistical Office. These surveys were earlier conducted on a five-yearly basis and the last few such surveys were in 1999-2000, 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12. During 2017-18, to have more frequent availability of Employment and Unemployment data, a new annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) was launched with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design as compared with the earlier quinquennial surveys. The PLFS gives estimates of key labour market statistical indicators in urban areas on a quarterly basis and generates annual estimates for rural and urban areas and are not comparable with the earlier quinquennial surveys.As per the Annual Report of PLFS for 2017-18, the labour force estimates for all ages for usual status workers, that is, combined principal and subsidiary economic activity status, are as follows:All-India labour force estimates (usual status) in percentage during 2017-18	                                                  Rural + Urban                                                       male	female	  personLabour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)		       55.5	 17.5	   36.9Worker Population Ratio (WPR)	                       52.1	 16.5	   34.7Unemployment Rate (UR)	                                6.2	  5.7	    6.1As per the latest quarterly report of PLFS, the Unemployment Rate as per weekly status in urban areas for all ages is as follows:Unemployment Rate (UR) (Weekly status) 	                          Urbanin percentage                                          male	female	   personApril-June, 2018	                               9.0	 12.8	    9.8July-September, 2018	                               8.9	 12.7	    9.7October-December, 2018	                               9.2	 12.3	    9.9January-March, 2019	                               8.7	 11.6	    9.3                                              *****
