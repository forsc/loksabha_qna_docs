ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):  Yes, Sir. The department-wise / post-wise data of corruption-related complaints received is not maintained centrally.  However, as per information provided by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the details of number of complaints received and action taken on them during the last five years   are given in Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.(c) & (d):   Recognizing the importance of complaints, as they constitute an important source of information leading to the exposure of misconduct and malpractices, various platforms have been developed for registration of complaints, including the corruption related complaints.  Such complaints can be filed, in written form, by post or online through the dedicated portals for this purpose.   In order to make the process of registration of complaints easier, this Ministry has developed a Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) i.e., pgportal.gov.in. for registration of all types of grievances including those relating to corruption.  Further, the CVC has a dedicated portal on its website, i.e., portal.cvc.gov.in and a toll free telephone number 1800110180 for registration of complaints.Contd.P.-2/--2-(e) & (f):  The Central Government is committed to its policy of “Zero Tolerance Against Corruption” and has taken several measures to combat corruption. 	The steps taken by the Central Government to combat corruption, inter alia, include:I.	Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These, inter alia,  include:a)	Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to the citizens under various schemes of the Government in a transparent manner through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative. b)	Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.c)	Introduction of e-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems.d)	Introduction of Government procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM).II.	Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India. III.	Invocation of FR-56(j) and AIS(DCRB) Rules, 1958 for prematurely retiring officials whose performance has been reviewed and found unsatisfactory. IV.	The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for strict timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings. V.	The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018 to bring a paradigm shift in tackling corruption in as much as clearly criminalizing the act of giving bribe, checking big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organizations where the act of giving of bribe is with their consent or connivance.   VI.	Issue of instructions by the CVC asking the organizations to adopt Integrity Pact in major                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed.VII.	The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of a Chairperson and eight Members, including four judicial Members. Lokpal is statutorily mandated to directly receive and independently process complaints as regards alleged offences against public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.	In addition, the CVC, as an apex integrity institution, has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and approach to combat corruption, which encompasses punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.  *****
