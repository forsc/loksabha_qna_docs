                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): All the drugs whether for Government supply or others, are required to be manufactured and sold in the country in accordance with the provisions of Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945.     	Further, to ensure quality of drugs in the Government drug supply chain, stringent provisions are in place. All the supplies are first got quality tested at appropriate testing laboratories before being distributed for the programme.    	  In so far as Hospitals coming under the purview of Central Government are concerned, the Store Department receives drugs from supplier against furnishing of Quality Certificate i.e. Form 39. If the medicine supplied is not accompanied by Form 39, samples are sent to Government approved labs for analysis. Drugs are issued for use only after Standard Quality report is received from the labs.      	  Further, the Government is committed to ensuring that the quality, safety and efficacy of drugs are not compromised. With this in view, the Government has taken a series of measures including strengthening of legal provisions, workshops and training programmes for manufacturers and regulatory officials and measures such as risk based inspections.
