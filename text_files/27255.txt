ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c) This Ministry has notified GSR 331(E) dated 17th May 2021 to amend  rule 95 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989, which proposes that the tyres categorised under classes C1, C2 and C3, as defined in AIS 142:2019,  shall meet the requirements of rolling resistance, wet grip and rolling sound emissions,  specified in Stage 2 of AIS 142:2019, as amended from time to time, till such time the corresponding BIS specifications are notified under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986. Comments and objections have been solicited from concerned stakeholders. A higher rating for rolling resistance indicates better fuel saving while higher wet grip ratings indicate solid braking capability of the tyre; a lower noise level connotes a more comfortable drive. These mandatory norms for rolling resistance, wet grip and rolling sound emissions proposed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will pave the way for “star rating” or “labeling” of tyres in the country.*****
