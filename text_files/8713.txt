In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganized sector including workers in agriculture sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganized workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti BimaYojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY) to the unorganized workers depending upon their eligibility. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of minimum assured monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, which is on contributory basis, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganized workers after attaining the age of 60 years.*******
