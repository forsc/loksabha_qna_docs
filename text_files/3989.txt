A list of major schemes administered by DAC&FW is annexed:(b):	As per the publication Land Use Statistics, 2017 the irrigated area and cultivable land for the State of Rajasthan for the year 2014-15 is as follows:-Cultivable land : 25511 thousand hectaresGross Irrigated Area : 10171 thousand hectaresNet Irrigated Area : 7882 thousand hectaresThe Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during the year 2015-16 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. The components of PMKSY are as under: Contd….2/-- 2 -i.

PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop (PDMC): Focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation technologies viz. Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation. Implemented by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW). Besides, promoting precision irrigation and better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources, this component also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement source creation. As per the PMKSY PDMC – Micro Irrigation Operational Guidelines, financial assistance up to 55% for Small & Marginal farmers and 45% for other farmers is available for installation of Micro Irrigation Systems. During the financial year 2019-20 an outlay of Rs 125 crore has been allocated to the State of Rajasthan for the implementation of Per Drop More Crop.(c):		The Government is implementing Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP) under National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET).  The main objective of the Sub-Mission is to develop/strengthen seed sector and to enhance production and multiplication of certified/ quality seeds of all agricultural crops and making it available to the farmers and also place an effective system for protection of plant varieties, rights of farmers and plant breeders to encourage development of new varieties of plants.             Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of urea is Rs.242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP of 50 kg bag of urea is Rs.268 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Accordingly, all farmers are being supplied urea at the subsidized rates.            The Government is already implementing Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for P&K fertilizers. Any farmer, who procures these fertilizers at MRP, avails the benefit of subsidy.
