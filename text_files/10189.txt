(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): 	 the district-wise details of the number of beneficiaries registered under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) in Rajasthan is given at Annexure.(b):  	 As on 30.11.2019, 7,60,65,061 beneficiaries in the county have been transferred the financial benefit under PM-Kisan Scheme. About Rs.35882.8 crore has so far been disbursed to the beneficiaries under the Scheme.(c) & (d):  Registration of farmers and transfer of financial benefits to them under the PM-Kisan Scheme is a continuous and ongoing process. Financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified eligible beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in. The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by them undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, of error-free data, and only then the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment. Hence, at any point of time, there remains unprocessed data of beneficiaries which are taken care of in due course of time.Contd…2/--2-	An exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-KISAN Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration.  Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar Card through the Farmers Corner.  Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner.  The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to assist the farmers in performing the above tasks.	On the instructions of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.*******
