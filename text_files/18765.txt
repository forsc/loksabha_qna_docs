ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)&(b):          The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) is in operation in 25 States and 3 Union Territory wherein payment of wages is being credited directly to the bank/post office accounts of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS workers by the Central Government through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on ensuring timely payment direct to the accounts of beneficiaries which inter alia includes advisory for generation of Fund Transfer Orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in crediting timely wages in the workers’ account.  During the current financial year 2020-21 (as on 26.01.2021), around 97.97 % Fund Transfer Orders have been generated within the specified 15 days. During the current financial year so far, about Rs. 67967 crore has been transferred by way of wage payment into the accounts of the beneficiaries through DBT. (c)&(d): Under the scheme, above 99% payment is being done through e-FMS. As per advisory of Department of Financial Services, related to  DBT payment, Banks have been directed to send SMS to the beneficiaries against every transaction from the financial institution on credit to her/his account. Ministry is in constant touch with states/UTs for appropriate dissemination of information regarding wage payment to beneficiaries. Ministry keeps on sensitising the States/UTs that beneficiaries may be advised to update their mobile number with banks for timely intimation of the credit into their account. *********
