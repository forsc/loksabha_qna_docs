MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Government is in the process of formulating a New Education Policy formeeting the changing dynamics of the population’s requirement with regard to qualityeducation, innovation and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower byequipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge. For this purpose, wideranging consultations were undertaken at multiple levels of online, expert / thematic andgrassroots from village to State, Zonal levels and the National level. Initially, a Committeefor Evolution of the New Education Policy was constituted, which submitted its report inMay, 2016 which was followed by the Ministry’s ‘Some Inputs for the Draft NationalEducation Policy, 2016’, both of which are considered as inputs for policy formulation.Thereafter, a Committee for the Draft National Education Policy was constituted in June2017 under the Chairmanship of eminent scientist Dr. K Kasturirangan, which hassubmitted the Draft National Education Policy 2019(DNEP 2019) to the Ministry on 31stMay 2019. The Draft NEP 2019 was uploaded on MHRD’s website athttps://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf andalso at https://innovate.mygov.in/list-nep/ to elicit comments and suggestions from thevarious stakeholders. Further, letters were written to States/UTs Governments andGovernment of India Ministries inviting their views and comments on DNEP 2019.
