During Covid pandemic in 2020 and 2021, this department collected information on milk procurement, price, sale and stocks on daily and weekly basis from cooperatives to analyse the dairy business situation in the country. Based on the information received and analysed assessment, following measures were taken:i)	On 13.05.2020, a new component was introduced in ongoing central sector scheme “Supporting State Dairy Cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations” scheme (SDC&FPO) for providing 2% interest subvention on working capital loan to cooperatives and milk producers companies and additional 2% interest subvention for prompt payment.
