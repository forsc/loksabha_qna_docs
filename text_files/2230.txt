Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at Annexure.Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. Based on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been completed and sent to concerned States.Further, draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States in March 2019.Various statutory clearances except Stage-II forest clearance & clearance from Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of Hon’ble Supreme Court have been accorded for components under KBLP Phase-I. The clearances for the projects proposed under KBLP Phase-II are in advanced stages. The comprehensive DPR of KBLP has been completed and circulated to Governments of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Draft Memorandum of Agreement for implementation of KBLP has been sent to Governments of MP and UP for concurrence. The Government is pursuing the inter-linking of rivers (ILR) program in a consultative manner. A “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted in September, 2014 under the Chairmanship of Hon`ble Minister of WR, RD & GR (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) for the implementation of ILR programme. Fifteen meetings of the Special Committee for ILR have been held so far (last meeting held on 20.08.2018).
