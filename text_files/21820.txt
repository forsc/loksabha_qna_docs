                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (d)  In order to ensure that entitlements reach the intended beneficiaries  under the Supplementary Programme (SNP) of Anganwadi Services  in a time-bound manner as per quality and nutritional standards for the achievement of nutritional goals,   streamlined guidelines have been issued on 13.01.2021. This provides for quality assurance, roles and responsibilities of duty holders, procedure for procurement, integrating AYUSH concepts and data management and monitoring through ‘Poshan Tracker’ for transparency, efficiency and accountability in delivery of Supplementary Nutrition. The States/UT have been advised to adhere to the guidelines scrupulously. (e) & (f)     States/UTs have been advised that Take-Home-Ration is not raw ration and/or dry ration and have also been asked to introduce transparent processes for procurement and ensure that THR  conforms to technical and nutritional standards set by Govt. Through sustained interactions with States including in recent review meetings, implementation related issues such as utilization of funds and need for timely submission of Utilization Certificates (UCs)/Statement of Expenditure (SoEs), etc. have been emphasized. ******
