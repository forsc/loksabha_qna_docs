Specifications of fertilizers are prescribed in the order.  Clause 19 of FCO strictly prohibits the sale of fertilizer which is not of prescribed standards.	State Governments are empowered under the Fertilizer (Control) Order/Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to take appropriate administrative and legal action against those dealers / manufacturers / importers who do not comply with the provisions prescribed in the Order.  The essential commodities Act prescribes a maximum punishment of seven years for violation of the provisions of FCO.  There are 82 fertilizer testing laboratories in the country.  Samples of fertilizers are drawn periodically by the fertilizer inspectors of the State Governments from retailers/wholesalers and manufacturing units, etc. for testing in the notified laboratories to check their quality in respect of the quality parameters prescribed in the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985.Pesticides are substances or preparations intended for purposes of preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any insects, rodents, fungi, weeds and other forms of plant or animal life not useful to human beings. Pesticides are inherently toxic in nature. However, they do not pose any adverse effect, if used as per label claims approved by the Registration Committee constituted under Section 5 of the Insecticides Act, 1968.  Pesticides are registered for use in the country by the Registration Committee only after satisfaction about their efficacy and safety to human health, animal and environment.

Insecticide samples are drawn on regular basis and analyzed in 69 State Pesticide Testing laboratories and two Regional Pesticide Testing Laboratories. Action is initiated against those samples which are found misbranded.During the last 3 years, 2467 prosecutions have been launched throughout India against firms which were found to be involved in selling and manufacturing of sub-standard pesticides and illegal import of pesticides.   (c):   	To address air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue, a new Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ for the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 has been launched with a total outgo of Central funds of Rs. 1151.80 crores.Under the scheme, financial assistance @ 80% of the project cost is provided to the Co-operative Societies of farmers, FPOs, Self-Help Groups, registered Farmers Societies / farmers groups, Private Entrepreneurs, Group of women farmers or self-help groups for establishment of farm machinery banks or custom hiring centres of in-situ crop residue management machinery.
