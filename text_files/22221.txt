Subsequently IWMP was amalgamated as a Watershed Development Component of Pradhan  Mantri Krishi  Sinchayee  Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16 and it was decided to focus on completion of all ongoing projects. Accordingly Government of Odisha, like other States, has been given requisite grants for completion of all ongoing projects. Since the Government is focusing on completion of all on-going projects, no new projects have been sanctioned under WDC-PMKSY since 2015-16.In Odisha, 310 watershed development projects were sanctioned under WDC-PMKSY (erstwhile IWMP) during 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of 17 lakh ha at a total cost of Rs. 2191.50 crore. So far, an amount of Rs. 1089.17 crore has already been released as Central share to Government of Odisha. Out of 310 sanctioned projects, as decided by the Government based on the performance of the projects, 76 preparatory phase projects were transferred to State on 01.08.2018 with a request to implement them with State budget.  As on 01.03.2021, out of balance 234 projects being funded by DoLR, 195 projects have been reported completed and 39 projects are in Works Phase. As per the information received from the State, as on 01.03.2021, Rs. 16.71 crore unspent balance is available for implementation of all ongoing projects.                                             *****
