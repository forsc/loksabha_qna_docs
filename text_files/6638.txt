( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):  	Under-spending in Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare was mainly under Schemes PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) (Direct Farmers Income Support) due to non-uploading of beneficiary data of eligible farmers by State Governments. Moreover, the gap in budgetary allocation and spending is due to lack of absorption capacity in North-East Region and non-release of earmarked funds for TSP and SCSP component.	So far as DARE/ICAR is concerned, the gap in budgetary allocation and spending is due to lack of absorption capacity in North East Region and non-release of earmarked funds for TSP and SCSP component.(b):	Under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana Government of India has enhanced budgetary provision from Rs.9429 crore (2018-19) to Rs.9684.56 crore (2019-20).
