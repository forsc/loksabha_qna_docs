ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)  	As per the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Guidelines, ensuring the quality of the road works is responsibility of the respective State Governments which are implementing the Programme. There is a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY. Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory. The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction. Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. Whenever, a work is reported deficient by NQMs, on account of both structural and non- structural defects, the PIU ensures that the contractor replaces the material or rectifies the defects, as the case may be. The action taken report (ATR), for each such work, is verified on ground by the State Quality Monitors (SQMs). Thereafter, the State Quality Coordinator (SQC) examines the ATR for each such work and furnishes the compliance report regularly through programme Management Information System (MIS) - Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS). To fast track the compliance on NQM observations, provisions have been made to upload and monitor the action taken report for each work through web based programme MIS- OMMAS.   (b) & (c) The state of Maharashtra has been allocated 6,550 km road length under PMGSY-III. The State has been sanctioned 380 roads of 2581.72 km length on 31.03.2021, 34 roads of 227.65 km length on 24.05.2021 and 16 roads of 116.55 km length on 04.10.2021.As per guidelines issued by the Ministry on 22nd December 2020, all sanctioned PMGSY works should be tendered, awarded and physically commence on ground in 72 days from the date of sanction. There is abnormal delay in awarding of works by the State Government which led to decrease in speed of the progress of PMSY-III works. The State of Maharashtra was given annual target of construction of 1400 km of road length during financial year 2021-22. The state has completed only 257.68 km as on 04.02.2022 which is only 18% of the annual target length. During the current year, the State of Maharashtra was supposed to construct 782 km length of road under PMGSY-III, however due to delay in tendering of the works by the state, no progress has been made under PMGSY-III till date. Due to delay in tendering process, 132 road works are yet to be awarded by the State. State was advised on a number of occasions during review meetings to expedite the tendering process to award these balance works.As the sanctioned works have recently started & inspections of works under PMGSY-III has not yet taken place. Guidelines provide 100 % inspections of works by State Quality Monitors (SQMs), apart from the quality control mechanisms of first and third tiers.*******
