                                                        THE MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e)  :   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*33 FOR 20.07.2021 REGARDING ONLINE POLICIES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) & (b)  : Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has informed that they have not received any complaint against any insurer alleging rejection of a claim in respect of insurance policy bought online.(c) 	   :  IRDAI has informed that the Head Offices including regional offices of the Public Sector Insurance Companies  respond to the notices issued by the consumer redressal forums. There are also local and regional offices of private insurance companies, but for the notices issued by the Consumer Commissions, the Head Offices of these insurance companies respond.Further, IRDAI has also informed that they have not received any complaint alleging that the insurers had not responded to the notices of consumer forums. However, in case any insurer does not respond to a legal notice they are liable to legal consequences.(d) & (e) : IRDAI has informed that no insurer can sell any insurance policy including online policies without the approval of IRDAI and as such no separate legal framework is required to ensure viability of online insurance products.  The terms and conditions of all policies are also approved by IRDAI, so as to ensure that rights of policyholders are protected. Consumer Commissions are quasi- judicial bodies that decide and resolve consumer complaints including those related to insurance claims. *****
