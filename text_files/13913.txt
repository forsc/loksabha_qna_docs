However, on-shore and off-shore oil and gas development and production remain as Category ‘A’ and would require public hearing before grant of environmental clearance.(b)	At  present any on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration project, has to obtain environmental clearance from the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority ( SEIAA), which is setup in the State Environment Department, under the purview of the State Government. Therefore, the power to take the final decision, as to whether allow any particular project in any particular region would remain with the  State Government. Further, such projects are also required to obtain consent under the Air and Water Acts from State Pollution Control Boards.(c) to (e) Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and Hon’ble Chief Minister of Pondicherry have raised the concern of the agricultural zone in the Cauvery belt.
