SHRI FEROZE VARUN GANDHI: Will the Minister of SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT be pleased to state: (a) the rationale for excluding “Topics/courses concerning Indian Culture/heritage/History/Social studies on India from the National Overseas Scholarship (NOS) Scheme; (b) the reasons the Government has changed the guidelines just two months prior to the application deadline;(c) whether any form of public consultation was conducted prior to the changes in these guidelines, if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; (d) whether the Government recognises that students who have secured admission in foreign universities with the legitimate expectation that the Government would continue its scholarship in all disciplines will be detrimentally affected by the impugned notification; and (e) whether the Government plans to revise the guidelines to ensure that students from Scheduled Castes, De-Notified Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes, Landless Agricultural Labourers and Traditional Artisans are not deterred from pursuing foreign degrees in social sciences and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a) to (e):    This department reviews the NOS scheme guidelines from time to time and makes changes for simplifying the procedures and to make the process more transparent. Since there is greater demand for study in science and technology fields, in order to better utilise the resources, scholarships can be prioritized for those subjects in greater demand. It was felt that the fields of study where India has strength or where the field work is to be done in India can be left out of the list. Accordingly, topics/courses concerning Indian Culture, Heritage, History & Social studies on India will not be considered for award of scholarships from 2022-23 onwards, whereas other Humanities/Social Sciences subjects, such as Law, Economics, Psychology etc. which need international exposure are still available for funding. This change has provided more opportunities for the poor SC students to study in global best universities.  In light of the above, the National Overseas Scholarship Scheme for SCs etc. will continue to be implemented by the Department with guidelines as revised recently.*****
