ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	The Government has identified 15 religious shrines in Pakistan for pilgrimage under the 1974 Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines between India and Pakistan. The details of these shrines are attached at Annexure. These 15 pilgrimage sites in Pakistan are maintained by the Evacuee Trust Property Board, Government of Pakistan. The Government of India, through its High Commission in Pakistan, coordinates with Pakistan authorities to ensure smooth pilgrimage of Indian pilgrims to these religious shrines in Pakistan. These pilgrimage sites are in a functional state.	The Government has come across reports regarding vandalism and desecration of places of religious worship belonging to the minority communities in Pakistan. Recently, following the reports of vandalism and desecration of Mata Rani Bhatiyani Temple in Sindh on 26 January 2020, the holy Gurudwara at Sri Nankana Sahib on 3 January 2020 and a Gandhara style Buddha statue in Mardan on 18 July 2020, the Government strongly condemned these reprehensible acts and called upon Pakistan to ensure safety, security and welfare of the members of the minority communities in Pakistan, including their places of worship, and take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators to justice.	There are many temples in Bangladesh which are also visited by pilgrims from India. Some of these places are centuries old and have been declared preserved heritage/archaeological sites by the Government of Bangladesh. The famous Dhakeshwari temple has been declared as the national temple of Bangladesh.***
