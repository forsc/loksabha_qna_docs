ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): Presently, 498 Railway Projects including 188 New Lines,  55 Gauge Conversion and 255 Doubling Projects of total length 49,069 Km, costing `6.75 lakh crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution. Thorough review of throughput enhancement projects has been carried out and with focussed approach, the projects have been prioritized into  Super Critical Projects (58 nos), Critical Projects (68 nos.) and other throughput enhancement projects (130 nos.). Presently, the balance length of Super Critical Projects is 2347 Km, 5676 Km of Critical Projects and 9703 Km for other Doubling Projects. The throw-forward for these projects is of the order of `1.84 lakh crores and all out sincere and focussed approach is being adopted by Railway for quick execution and  early return to Railways.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot  of monitoring  is  done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.  For capacity enhancement projects, etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects. (b): Yes, Sir. (c) & (d): New line from Solapur to Usmanabad via Tuljapur (84.44 Km) has been sanctioned in January, 2019,  at a cost of `904.92 crore. An Outlay of `5 crore has been allotted for 2019-20. Land acquisition proposal for 7.45 Hectare land has been submitted to Collector, Usmanabad. Further, preparation of land acquisition proposal for balance length has been taken up.  *****
