PMKSY is not region or state specific but demand driven and is implemented across the country including in the state of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Under its component scheme - Creation / Expansion of Food Processing &   Preservation Capacities scheme, MoFPI provides grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing units, whereas under the Mega Food Parks scheme and Infrastructure   for Agro Processing Clusters scheme, it provides grants-in-aid for setting up of Mega food Parks & Agro Processing Clusters respectively. Proposals for financial assistance are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) under these component schemes. The state-wise status of projects approved, including in the state of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, and Budgetary Estimate (BE) for 2021-22 for these component schemes is placed at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. *****
