ANSWER




A N S W E RMINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY, CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION AND TEXTILES(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO.398 FOR ANSWER ON 30.03.2022 IN THE LOK SABHA.(a) to (c):		Government of India enacted National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 which provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population thus covering the bottom 67% of the population, which at Census 2011 is at a maximum limit of 81.35 crore persons. Identification of beneficiaries under the Act is under two categories- households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH). Priority Households are entitled to receive 5 Kg per person per month and AAY households are entitled to receive 35 Kg of foodgrains per household per month at highly subsidized central issue prices of Rs 1/2/3 per kg for coarsegrains/wheat/rice respectively. There is no Below Poverty Line (BPL) category under the Act. However, the coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit.Allocation of foodgrains(rice, wheat and coarsegrains) to States/ UTs under the Act is made on the basis of State/UT-wise coverage of population determined by the then Planning Commission, identification of beneficiaries by States/UTs within the coverage, and foodgrains entitlement prescribed under the Act. The Act further provides that if on the above basis, annual foodgrains allocation to any State/UT is lower than the average annual offtake during 2010-11 to 2012-13 under erstwhile normal Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the same shall be protected.The Act provides for coverage of 60.96% of rural and 41.14% of the urban population of the Andhra Pradesh which at Census 2011 comes to 268.23 lakh persons. Under the Act, the State is entitled to 18,71,847.468 MT of foodgrains per annum (1,55,987.289 MT per month) including 1,53,460.332 MT of foodgrains per annum under the “tide over” allocation. At present, the monthly allocation of 1,55,987 MT of foodgrains (including 1838.970 MT as tide over allocation) to the State Government of Andhra Pradesh, is as per provisions of the Act.***
