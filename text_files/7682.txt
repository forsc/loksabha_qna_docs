                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Appointment of LPG distributorships is a continuous process and locations for setting up of LPG distributorships are identified based on sale potential that makes them commercially viable. As on 01.11.2019, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have 24204 LPG distributors across the country. During the last 5 years i.e. from 2014-15 to 2018-19, OMCs have commissioned more than 9 thousand LPG distributorships to make LPG easily available and accessible to the customers. Further, Government has taken various measures to improve the existing LPG distribution system which include :-(i) directing OMCs that no distributor shall supply refills beyond 15 kms unless authorised in writing by the OMCs.(ii) directing OMCs to effect intra and inter-company transfer of customers keeping in view the need to provide timely refill delivery to LPG consumers.(b) & (c) To meet the growing demands of LPG, OMCs have initiated steps for establishment of Private Bottling facilities in various areas and have floated tenders for 60 locations including in the State of Karnataka.--------
