The Government is conducting surveys to capture change in employment in various establishments in the country. Labour Bureau, an attached office of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, has been entrusted with the task of conducting the All India Quarterly Establishment based Employment Survey (AQEES). It measures the change in employment in respect of establishments in nine selected sectors namely Manufacturing; Construction; Trade; Transportation; Education; Health; Accommodation & Restaurants; IT/BPO; and Financial Service Sector. AQEES has two components:i)	Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) in respect of establishments employing ten or more workers. ii)	Area Frame Establishment Survey (AFES) in respect of establishments employing nine or less workers.An Expert Group has been constituted under the Chairmanship of renowned Statistician Prof. S.P. Mukherjee to advice on technical aspects of the surveys. Government of India has also entrusted Labour Bureau to conduct All India Survey on Migrant Workers. The objective of the survey is to generate basic quantitative information on migrant workers and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their work. The survey will also throw light on the socio-economic conditions of migrant workers. Data will be captured on their education level, vocational/technical training, gender, social group, accommodation (housing), consumption expenditure, income, financial inclusion, and change in income after migration. The survey will be paperless with the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) technology where the enumerators and supervisors visit the household duly equipped with a hand held electronic device that ensures faster & easier data collection, collation and compilation.  Government has planned to complete All India Survey on Migrant Workers in one year, after which results will be released.Report of All India Survey on Quarterly Establishment based Employment Survey (AQEES) will be released within 2 months from completion of the field survey.  Thereafter, AQEES report will be released, every quarter. *******
