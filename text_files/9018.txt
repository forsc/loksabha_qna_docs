ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) Tiruvannamalai station, which caters to pilgrims/passengers desirous of visiting the Arunachaleswar Temple, is presently being well served by 12 Mail/Express and 6 Passenger (in single) trains.  Further, 12867/12868 Howrah-Puducherry Express, the only train presently not having a scheduled stoppage at Tiruvannamalai, is a long distance train with limited stoppages en-route. Proliferation of stoppages en-route this service will not only decelerate the train but also cause inconvenience to the through passengers. *****
