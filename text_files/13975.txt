                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):  The Ministry is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. Under the scheme institutional care is provided through Child Care Institutes (CCIs), as a rehabilitative measure. The programmes and activities in Homes inter-alia include age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. Further CPS also provides for “After care” services after the age of 18 years to help sustain them during the transition from institutional to independent life. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the States/UTs.The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme was launched on 22nd January, 2015 as an awareness generation campaign to address the critical issue of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) in the age group of 0-6 years and aims to change mindsets to value girl child.   It is a tri ministerial effort of Ministries of Women and Child Development, Health & Family Welfare and Human Resource Development. The specific objectives of the scheme are (i) prevent gender biased sex selective elimination (ii) ensure survival and protection of the girl child and (iii) ensure education and participation of the girl child through coordinated and convergent efforts.  The BBBP Scheme is implemented through the District  Authorities. As informed by the State Govt. of Maharashtra no special cell has been constituted. However, under Section 41 of the JJ Act, registration of institutions including Homes for CNCP has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. As per Section 54 of the JJ Act, the State Governments/UT Administrations are required to conduct regular inspections and monitor the CCIs to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Model Rules, 2016 framed there-under. All the State/UT Governments have been asked to close the CCIs who have declined to register under the JJ Act, 2015 and to rehabilitate the children in registered Institutions. The Ministry has requested to Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs to monitor all the CCIs under the supervision of District Magistrates and issued an advisory to the States and UTs regarding the action to be taken in case of disruption to the life of children in case of any untoward incidence of abuse in any CCI. ****
