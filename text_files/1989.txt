ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.    ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1828 BY SHRI MANICKAM TAGORE B. TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING ROB IN THIRUTHANGAL(a) to (d): Yes, Sir. The representation has been received from Hon’ble Chief Minister special cell, TamilNadu on 22.08.2017 for construction of Road over Bridge (ROB) in lieu of Level Crossing (LC) No. 424 (Local name: Thiruthangal) at Km 559/700-800. However, the above work has already been sanctioned on cost sharing basis in Budget 2015. Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion. However, it is difficult to construct ROBs/RUBs on approaches because it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc.In this case, the original alignment has been revised by State Government twice. The last revision of alignment was proposed by State Government in May 2019. Further action in this regard will be taken after finalization of alignment and when State Government is ready for taking up the work in approach portion.*****
