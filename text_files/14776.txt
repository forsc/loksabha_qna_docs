ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (d): The outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), first in China and now having being confirmed in more than 100 countries, has emerged as a key risk to human health as well as global growth outlook through numerous channels like trade, production and supply chain disruptions; decline in demand; lower tourism and business travel; loss of investor confidence; and productivity losses from the health impact on morbidity & mortality of work force. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has been coordinating the efforts of the Central Government in terms of preparedness, control and containment measures and has also been working with State Governments in order to mitigate the impact of the virus outbreak in India. As is true for the world at large, India’s near-term macroeconomic outlook is also vulnerable to disruption of trade with China and second-round effects arising from expected slowdown in global growth. However, latest available data on trade and indicators of domestic output do not suggest any adverse impact on the economy. Additionally, a positive impact on India’s economy may arise from decline in global oil prices triggered by the outbreak of COVID-19.In order to address the possibility of trade-induced adverse impact on the economy, Government is constantly engaging with Export Promotion Councils and trade bodies, particularly in pharmaceutical, electronics and automobile sectors where the supply chains are sourcing imports from China. These agencies have been put in touch with Indian Missions abroad to secure and transport inventories available with the existing suppliers. Indian Missions abroad have also been asked to explore alternate sources of supply of raw materials in their respective countries for supporting India’s domestic production.  *****
