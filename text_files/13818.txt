ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	As per National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) data of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the number of estimated incidence cancer cases in India for year 2020 is about 17.35 lakh, which is higher than the World Health Organization estimates. As per NCRP data, there is a risk of one in eight men and one in nine women developing cancer for 0-74 years, in the absence of any competing cause of death. The estimated mortality of cancer cases in India was 8.01 lakh in 2018. The information about lifetime risk of death due to cancer in India is not available. (b) & (c):	The cancer patients are diagnosed and treated by different specialties at various levels in the healthcare delivery system including medical colleges, district hospitals and other tertiary care institutions of state and central government. The data on total expenditure and investment for cancer is not maintained centrally since it is not possible to quantify and segregate from other diseases. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancers, 616 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,872 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke (NPCDCS).  Under the National Health Mission (NHM) support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs. To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. 	(d) & (e):	Details of faculty at All India Institutes of Medical Sciences,  as per available information, is at Annexure. Recruitment to various positions is done on need basis keeping in view the range of additional services and facilities planned to be added in the hospitals. The incumbency position at various AIIMS is monitored regularly and vacancies are advertised from time to time depending on their requirement.
