ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	State/UT-wise number of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) in the country isannexed.(b)  	Currently, Government is providing honorarium to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) @ ? 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs @ ? 3,500/- per month; and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs)@ ? 2,250/- per month. The Government is also providing performance linked incentive of ? 250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1st October, 2018. AWWs are paid performance linked incentive of ? 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. In addition to this, most of the States/UTs are also providing monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources.Under the Anganwadi Services Scheme, the funding pattern between Centre and States/UTs is as under:Category of States/UTs	Components	General	Salary	SNPStates/UTs with Legislature	60:40	25:75	50:50NE/Himalayan States& UT of J&K	90:10	90:10	90:10UT Without Legislature	100:0	100:0	100:0(c)	Presently, there is no proposal under consideration to increase the honorarium of Anganwadi Workers.(d) 	AWWs/AWHs are honorary workers who come forward to render their services on payment of monthly honorarium. In view of the very nature of the role of Anganwadi Workers/Helpers, it is not feasible to declare them as regular/permanent employees. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in a ruling of 07.12.2006 in Civil Appeal No. 4853-4957 of 1998 – State of Karnataka & Ors. vs. Ameerbi&Ors. has held that Anganwadi Workers/Helpers do not hold any civil post.(e) & (f) Out of 16 recommendations/observations made by the Dr. ChandreshKumari Committee, 14 recommendations have been implemented. Pursuant to the observations made by the Committee in its Sixteen Report, Ministry of Women & Child Development has furnished action taken report to the Committee. **** AnnexureSTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION  No. 921 FOR 07.02.2020 REGARDING HONOURARIUM FOR ANGANWADI WORKERS ASKED BY  SHRI RAVINDRA KUSHWAHA, SHRI VIJAY BAGHEL AND SHRI OMPRAKASH BHUPALSINH ALIAS PAWAN RAJENIMBALKARState/UT-wise details of sanctioned and In-position number of AWWsS no.
