ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (e) : Presently there is no legal provision to mandate local storage of data in the country. However, section 43A provides for compensation to be paid to the victim in case of unauthorized access of information and leakage of sensitive personal information respectively. It mandates ‘body corporates’ to implement ‘reasonable security practices’ for protecting ‘sensitive personal information’ of individuals. The Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 notified under section 43A mandates that body corporate must provide policy for privacy and disclosure of information, so that user is well aware of the type of personal data collected, purpose of collection and usage of such information. The rules also specify mode of collection of information, disclosure of information, transfer of information, etc. In addition, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology is working on the Personal Data Protection Bill to safeguard the privacy of citizens, and proposes to table it in Parliament. The Bill proposes local storage of critical and sensitive personal data.********
