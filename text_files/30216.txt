An equal amount on a matching basis is to be contributed by the State/Urban Local Body (ULB). (c):  The implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. The SPVs plan, implement, operate, monitor, and evaluate their Smart City projects. At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the State.  At the National level, implementation of SCM is monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  Nominee Directors of MoHUA on the Boards of SPVs monitor progress in respective cities on a regular basis.  MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and handhold them for improving the same. Smart Cities regularly report progress of projects, including utilization of funds through the Online Geospatial Management Information System (GMIS).                                      ***
