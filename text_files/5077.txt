Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority concern of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like  Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt.Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme run by Ministry of Rural Development and  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) run by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Details of employment generated through these schemes/ programmes including in the State of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are given at Annexure.	Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) has been launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years. Till 15th July, 2019, benefits have been given to 1.21 crore beneficiaries. 	To ascertain the employment and unemployment situation in the country, the quinquennial labour force surveys were conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Labour Bureau also conducts annual employment-unemployment survey which was last conducted during 2016-17.  Considering the need for availability of labour force statistics at more frequent intervals, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation had launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during 2017-18, with the objective of measuring quarterly changes of various statistical indicators of the labour market in urban areas as well as generating the annual estimates of different labour force indicators both in rural and urban areas.  *****
