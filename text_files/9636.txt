(b):     Under the National Health Mission, ASHAs are envisaged to be community health volunteers and are entitled to task/activity based incentives. The incentives to ASHAs for different tasks are regularly reviewed from time to time. Accordingly, during financial year 2018-19, the Government of India has  approved increase in the amount of routine and recurring incentives under National Health Mission for ASHAs that will enable ASHAs to get at least Rs 2000/- per month subject to carrying out assigned tasks.  A list of various activities for which performance- based incentives are provided to ASHAs, is annexed.            Apart from incentives approved for ASHAs at national level, States have the flexibility to design ASHA incentives. 15 States have introduced fixed monthly honorarium or top up incentives for ASHAs from State funds.
