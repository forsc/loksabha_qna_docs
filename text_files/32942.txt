The Screening Committee of Central Water Commission in its meeting held on 24.10.2018 accorded “in-principle” clearance for preparation of DPR by project authority (Government of Karnataka) subject to certain conditions including that: “As the main objective of this scheme as stated in the FR is to implement the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal(CWDT) Award as modified by the Hon''ble Supreme Court, acceptance of Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) would be a pre-requisite for consideration of the DPR by the Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR”.Subsequently, DPR of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project was submitted to CWC by Government of Karnataka in January 2019 and copies of the same were forwarded to Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA).The State of Tamil Nadu has requested the Central Government to advise the Government of Karnataka not to take up the Mekedatu project.Discussion on the DPR of the above project was included as an agenda item during various meetings of CWMA. However, discussion on this issue could not take place due to lack of consensus among party States on this agenda item.  *****
