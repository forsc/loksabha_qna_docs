ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) to (d)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has mandated all Telecom Service Providers to establish a two-tier complaint/grievance redressal mechanism for handling consumer complaints through the Telecom Consumers Protection and Redressal of Grievances Regulations, 2012. 	In terms of this Regulation, a consumer can lodge service-related complaints at the complaint centre of their Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). In case complaint is not redressed satisfactorily, an appeal can be registered with Appellate Authority of the TSPs. 	In case a grievance is not redressed even after exhausting the two tier procedure as prescribed by TRAI, the complainant may approach Public Grievance wing of Department of Telecommunications (DoT), for non-redressal of grievance at concerned Service Provider level. Complainant may also submit this grievance through the Centralized Public Grievance Redressal And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) Portal (www.pgportal.gov.in). 	TRAI has laid down various quality standards/benchmarks for telecom Service Providers, through the following Regulations: -i. 	Quality of Service of Broadband Service Regulations 2006 (11 of 2006) and two amendmentsii. 	The Standards of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) And Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations, 2009 (7of 2009) and seven amendmentsiii. 	The Standards of Quality of Service for Wireless Data Services Regulations, 2012 (26 of 2012) and one amendment. ********
