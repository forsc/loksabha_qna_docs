ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was  launched  on  25th June,  2015 in  500  selected  cities with focus on providing basic infrastructure in water supply, sewerage & septage management, storm water drainage, green spaces & parks, and non-motorized urban transport sectors.  33 cities of Andhra Pradesh have been selected under AMRUT.  List of cities is placed at ANNEXURE-I.(b)&(c)Yes, Sir.  Government of Andhra Pradesh had requested, vide communication dated 14.5.2018, to also provide the cost of additional projects worth Rs.872.74 crore over and above the approved committed Central Assistance of Rs.1,056.62 crore.  Government of Andhra Pradesh had also requested to cover all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) of the State under AMRUT.(d)	Under AMRUT, Central Share have been allocated to the States/ Union Territories (UTs) based on the equitable formula giving equal weightage to the urban population of the State/ UT (as per 2011 census) and the number of statutory towns in State/UT.  The States/UTs, which have taken projects in excess of approved plan size under AMRUT have to bear the additional cost themselves. Moreover, Mission does not have any untied funds available for providing additional grant to States/UTs. Government of Andhra Pradesh, therefore, was requested to consider funding of the projects beyond plan size through its own resources.                               *****
