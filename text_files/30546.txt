Both the schemes provide end to end support to organic farmers from organic production to certification and marketing including post harvest management support like processing, packaging, storage etc. PKVY is implemented in all the States across the country to promote organic farming in cluster mode, in which, farmers are provided financial assistance of Rs 50000/ha for 3 years in which, RS 31000/ ha / 3 years is provided directly to farmers through DBT for organic inputs such as seeds, bio fertilisers, bio-pesticides, organic manure, compost/vermi-compost, botanical extracts etc. MOVCDNER is implemented in all the North Eastern States for promotion of certified organic production, in which, organic farmers are supported to develop their value chain from organic production to processing and marketing etc. through FPO formation. Under the scheme a sum of Rs. 46,575/ha for 3years are provided for creation of FPO, support to farmers for organic inputs, quality seeds/ planting material and training, hand holding and certification. Besides, financial assistance are also provided as subsidy to FPOs and Private entrepreneurs.

Similarly, the Council has developed improved and efficient strains of bio-fertilizers specific to different crops and soil types under Network Project on Soil Biodiversity-Bio-fertilizers. Based on these studies ICAR is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, bio-fertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients to improve soil health and fertility.*********                                                                     Annexure -I.
