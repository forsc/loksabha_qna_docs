ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d) 	India shares a land and maritime border with Myanmar and has direct stakes in the maintenance of peace and stability in the country. As part of our ''Neighbourhood First'' and ''Act East'' policies, India has supported socio-economic development in Myanmar and facilitated the process of democratic transition in the country. The recent developments in Myanmar are therefore of deep concern. India has urged that the rule of law and democratic process be upheld and called upon the Myanmar leadership to work together to resolve their differences in a peaceful and constructive manner. India will closely monitor the situation in Myanmar and remain in discussion with the international community, including at the UNSC on this issue.India’s relationship with Myanmar remains independent of its relationship with third countries.***
