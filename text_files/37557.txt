ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b):  The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare conducts one integrated survey namely National Family Health Survey (NFHS) at an interval of about 3 years. The broad objectives of NFHS are to provide high quality data on population and health indicators as well as data on emerging issues in health and family welfare and to provide essential information that may assist policymakers and programme managers in setting benchmarks.  Five rounds of NFHS have been completed during the period 1992-93, 1998-99, 2005-06, 2015-16 and 2019-21. Keeping in view the content, coverage, sample size, design and methodology, the fourth round of NFHS has been considered as the benchmark for all future rounds of the survey. The State/UT wise details of performance of key health and family welfare indicators in NFHS-4 (2015-16) and NFHS-5 (2019-21) including the State of Odisha are given at Annexure-I. (c) & (d): It is evident from the recent round of NFHS that there are significant improvements in the key health, family welfare and associated indicators as compared to the previous rounds. The performance of key indicators emerged in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 are given at Annexure-II.****
