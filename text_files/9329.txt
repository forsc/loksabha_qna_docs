However, wherever there is a delay in completion of NH project due to faulty execution of work by the concerned contractor, action against the contractors/concessionaires is taken in accordance with the Agreement provisions.  The action taken depends upon delays and varies from financial penalty to termination of the contract.Cost overrun is applicable only to Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contracts. In such contracts, there is a provision for payment of escalation due to delay. In case the project is delayed due to reasons attributable to the contractor, liquidated damages are to be imposed and no escalation is paid. Actual escalation due to delay or cost overrun is known only after completion of the project and final settlement of bills.A length of 3061.34 km of 4 lane NHs has been targeted for completion during FY 2019-20.*****
