ANSWER




                                                                  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) and (b) ‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects. The matter falls within the domain of the respective State and UT Governments and related data is available with them. 	However, in respect of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), whose land matters are under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, multistoried apartments are constructed with the approval of building plans by the Urban Local Body concerned as per provisions of Unified Building Bye Laws-2016 and Master Plan of Delhi-2021. In case any violation is noticed, action is taken under the provisions of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1956 or New Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1994, as the case may be.	In respect of the Development Area notified under the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) allows construction only when all necessary sanctions and permissions have been obtained. DDA has prepared a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for taking action against unauthorized constructions from time to time.  (c)  The responsibility to ensure implementation of the building norms vests with the respective Urban Development Authority/ Urban Local Body, which function under the jurisdiction of the States/ UTs.For the guidance of the States/UTs, the Ministry has issued Model Building Bye Laws, 2016 and Urban & Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation Guidelines (URDPFI), 2014.                              ******
