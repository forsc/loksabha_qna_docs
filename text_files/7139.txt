ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) is a Centrally Sponsored scheme, under which financial and technical assistance is provided to States/ UTs for rural water supply. This has now been restructured and subsumed intoJal Jeevan Mission (JJM) which aims atenabling every rural household to have a Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) for providing potable water at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) by 2024.(b) State-wise fund released under NRDWP including the States of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh covering Bundelkhand during the last three years is Annexed.(c) Government of India has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a water conservation campaign, which is being implemented in two phases in 256 water-stressed districts of the country. The Phase–I was implemented from 1st July, 2019 to 30th September, 2019 across the country and Phase–II is being implementedfrom 1st October, 2019 to 30th November, 2019in the Southern States which receive retreating monsoon. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India have worked with State and District officials in these districts to promote water conservation and water resource management by focusing on accelerated implementation of five target interventions, viz. water conservation & rainwater harvesting, renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks, reuse and recharge of bore wells, watershed development and intensive afforestation. With this campaign, huge awareness has been generated and various stakeholders, viz. government departments, agencies, NGOs, officials, Panchayats, individuals, etc. have started taking steps for water conservation.	For effective drinking water supply, provision has been made under JJM for providing rural households with a service level of 55 lpcd against 40 lpcd norm under erstwhile NRDWP.(d) Under erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), the coverage was monitored in terms of Fully Covered (FC) habitations i.e. having provision of minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water with sources at a reasonable distance. As reported by States/ UTs, as on 15.11.2019, out of total 17.24 lakh rural habitations, around 14 lakh habitationswith 76.58% rural population are fully covered with provision of 40 litre or more per capita per day (lpcd) and 2.67 lakh habitations with19.67% rural population are partially covered, i.e. with provision of less than 40 lpcd whereas 55,721 habitations with 3.75% rural population are having sources with quality issues.*****
