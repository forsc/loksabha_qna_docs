ANSWER




MINISTER WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d): As per the information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), district-wise data of the total no of missing women & children reported from West Bengal during the year 2017 to 2019 is Annexed. The Ministry of Women and Child Development hosts a web  portal "TrackChild" to track the missing and found children. The TrackChild Portal is implemented in association with various stakeholders including Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Railways, State Governments/UT Administrations, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards, National Legal Services Authority, etc. “Khoya-Paya” is a citizen centric portal for reporting sighted children. The Ministry also supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress under ''Child Protection Services'' scheme, which is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 accessible from any where in India. The National Commission for Women and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights have issued  notices to the State in respect of such complaints.The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) mandates safety net of service delivery structures along with Institutional and non- Institutional care for children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law. Section 2 (14) (vii) defines missing children as children in need of care and protection. The Ministry implements a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme for supporting the children in distress conditions. Under CPS, financial assistance is provided to States/UTs, for, inter-alia, undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances and for setting up and maintenances of  Child Care Institutes (CCIs) for providing  rehabilitative services. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act rests with the States/UTs. ***  AnnexureAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) to (d) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1979 for answer on 12.02.2021raised by Shri Jyotirmay Singh Mahato regarding “Missing Children”.District-wise Women and Children missing in West Bengal during 2017 and 2018 provided by NCRB is as follows: Sl No	District	2017	2018	2019		 ChildrenTotal	Adult Women (Above 18 Yrs)	ChildrenTotal	Adult Women (Above 18 Yrs)	ChildrenTotal	Adult Women (Above 18 Yrs)1	Alipurduar	157	536	174	572	174	5722	Asansol-Durgapur PC	96	411	110	624	110	6243	Bankura	40	451	121	583	121	5834	Barrackpur PC	668	1390	610	1366	610	13665	Bidhannagar PC	173	430	159	457	159	4576	Birbhum	38	277	57	358	57	3587	Coochbehar	173	813	224	942	224	9428	Dakshin Dinajpur	194	615	239	712	239	7129	Darjeeling	43	238	44	269	44	26910	Hooghly Rural Police	238	572	271	737	271	73711	Howrah GRP	10	18	12	24	12	2412	Howrah PC	255	613	269	715	269	71513	Howrah Rural	368	695	330	820	330	82014	Jalpaiguri	109	643	112	728	112	72815	Jhargram	50	143	57	188	57	18816	Kharagpur GRP	1	4	1	1	1	117	Kolkata	857	1667	989	1918	989	191818	Malda	314	856	314	856	314	85619	Murshidabad	74	1539	70	1758	70	175820	Nadia	291	1484	474	2076	474	207621	Paschim Medinipur	272	627	402	910	402	91022	Purab Medinipur	222	662	294	716	294	71623	Purulia	47	188	28	251	28	25124	Sealdah GRP	17	18	9	22	9	2225	Siliguri GRP	0	1	0	3	0	326	Siliguri PC	355	648	323	703	323	70327	Uttar Dinajpur	183	482	69	504	69	50428	Baruipur Police	485	1139	375	829	375	82929	Chandannagar PC	149	393	112	464	112	46430	Diamond Harbour Police	497	728	439	979	439	97931	Kalimpong	14	84	29	103	29	10332	Purba Bardhaman	275	643	321	726	321	72633	Sundarban Police	152	470	86	526	86	52634	Barasat	1006	1945	724	1629	724	162935	Basirhat	355	579	357	731	357	731 	Total	8178	22002	8205	24800	8205	24800Source: Crime in India Note: Due to non-receipt of data from West Bengal for 2019 in time, data furnished for the year 2018 has been used for the year 2019*****
