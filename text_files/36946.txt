This decision was communicated by the Ministry in April, 2020 but no response has been received from the project authority till date. As the case is pending since 2017 and the requisite documents are still awaited, it has been decided to suomotu close the case. Therefore, this Ministry does not propose to fix any new time line for this project. *
