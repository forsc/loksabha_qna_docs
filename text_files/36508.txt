It may be noted that in Andhra Pradesh, one Model Rural Health Research Unit (MRHRU) was sanctioned in 2014-15 at Chandragiri under the mentorship of ICMR- National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad. In the current financial year, there was a target of establishing two MRHRUs. In response to the proposals invited from all States, Andhra Pradesh Government had submitted a proposal in October, 2021 for establishing MRHRUs in twelve (12) locations. Narasaraopet was, however, not covered in the 12 locations proposed by State Government. ******
