                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) and (b): 		Department of Food & Public Distribution (DFPD) extends  price support for procurement of paddy and wheat for central pool which are procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Government agencies.     	The details of procurement of rice and wheat by FCI/State Government/ State Government  agencies is at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. The acquisition cost of rice and wheat from marketing season 2012-13  onwards is as under:-..........2/--2-Year	Rice( Rs./Qtl)	Wheat( Rs./Qtl)2012-13	2,017.59	1,482.762013-14	2,225.54	1,557.522014-15	2,446.16	1,664.392015-16	2,622.23	1,773.232016-17	2,672.37	1,834.752017-18	2,772.58	1,891.812018-19	2,893.68	1,956.882019-20 (RE)	3,051.40	2,115.07(c) and (d): 		Procurement policy of Government of India (GOI) is open ended, under which paddy and wheat  offered by farmers within the stipulated period (conforming to specifications prescribed in advance by GOI) are purchased for Central Pool at MSP by Food Corporation of India/ State Governments/ State Government Agencies  to help farmers get remunerative  price and prevent distress sale.  Coarsegrains are procured at MSP by State Governments as per the procurement plan prepared in consultation with FCI and approved by the Central Government, subject to  its distribution by the State Government  under National Food Security Act (NFSA)/ Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). Procurement is done on the basis of several factors like levels of production, availability of marketable surplus stock and marketing infrastructures and varies from state to state. Government of India also encourages States to adopt Decentralised Procurement System to increase level of procurement in such states where procurement is low.  The following steps are taken to ensure that farmers get remunerative price for wheat and paddy:i) 	Before the onset of each marketing season, Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India (GOI) holds a consultative meeting with the officials of Food Corporation of India, State Governments and others to make an assessment of availability of wheat and paddy/rice for procurement at MSP based on the prospects of production and market situation. ii) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. iii) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. iv) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.                                             **** Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.460 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 04.02.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.
