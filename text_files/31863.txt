(a) & (b) : National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes information on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”. The published reports are available till the year 2020, which is available on the website of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) (https://ncrb.gov.in). As per data published by NCRB, the number of registered cases of crimes against women in Rajasthan during 2019 and 2020 were 41550 and 34535 respectively.  The data shows that the registered cases of crimes against women in Rajasthan have declined from the year 2019 to the year 2020. (c) to (e): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women and children rests primarily with the respective State Governments.However, the Central Government gives highest priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard. These include legislations such as ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018’, ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2006’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, etc. The schemes/ projects include One Stop Centres (OSCs) (33 such centres are functional in Rajasthan); Universalisation of Women Helplines (WHL) (WHL is functional in Rajasthan), Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) which is a pan-India single number (112)/ mobile app based system for emergencies (ERSS is functional in Rajasthan); a cyber-crime reporting portal to report obscene content; safe city projects in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai) including infrastructure, technology adoption and capacity building in community through awareness programmes, training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers; distribution of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to States/ UTs; establishment of state of the art DNA Laboratory at CFSL, Chandigarh; assistance to 24 States/ UTs to strengthen Forensic Science Laboratories; setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for speedy disposal of cases of rape and cases under POCSO Act; setting up/ strengthening of Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in all districts of the country; setting up/ strengthening of Women Help Desks (WHDs) at Police Stations etc.   Further, the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) through State Legal Service Authorities (SLSAs) and District Legal Service Authorities (DLSAs) provides free legal aid to all women irrespective of their income. During the year 2020-21 and 2021-22 (upto October, 2021), a total of 519 and 433 women have been assisted in the State of Rajasthan. In addition, NALSA also provides legal help and assistance through helpline, email, web-portal and mobile app. NALSA has also framed a scheme named as Compensation Scheme for Women Victims / Survivors of Sexual Assault / other crimes - 2018'' for quantifying compensation. The Central Government has also assisted the States / UTs by providing one time grant of Rs. 200 crore under Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) from Nirbhaya Fund.
