ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b) With a view to improving utilization of coaching stock, ensuring punctual running of trains, releasing maintenance slots and improving turn-around time, Indian Railways undertakes standardization /rationalizing of   rakes, which is an on-going process. However, since the composition of trains are dependent on factors like nature of service, timings of service, route, clientele, etc., running of all trains with standardized composition is not feasible. (c) & (d) In some cases, upgradation of infrastructural facilities like lengthening of platform/pit line etc., may be needed. However, this expenditure is required to get benefits of standardization which are enumerated above. (e) & (f) No, Sir. The practice relating to standardization of rakes is applicable to all routes and is not restricted to specific routes/trains.
