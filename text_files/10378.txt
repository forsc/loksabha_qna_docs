Further, an updating survey for construction of new railway line from Pipar Road-Bhopalgarh-Asop-Shankwas-Mundwa-Nagour (96.00 Km) has been completed during 2018-19. As per the survey report, the construction cost of new line has been assessed as `339.92 crore with a negative rate of return of 9.22%. The project could not be taken forward due to unremunerative nature of the project.(c): Kishangarh-Parbatsar (45 Km) new  line project was included in Capital Investment Programme 2016-17 in anticipation that Joint Venture (JV) company of Government of Rajasthan will identify this project for execution. However, Government of Rajasthan has not formed the JV company with Ministry of Railways.*****
