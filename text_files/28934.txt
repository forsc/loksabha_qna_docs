ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c) : The Government provides financial assistance/subsidy to small and marginal farmers @ 55% and to other farmers @45% for installation of Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems under Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC). In addition, some States provide additional incentives/top up subsidy for encouraging farmers to adopt Micro Irrigation. For larger adoption of Micro Irrigation systems by the farmers under the PMKSY- PDMC scheme, 25% higher unit cost have been taken into calculation of subsidy for the North Eastern and Himalayan States and 15% higher for States having lower adoption of Micro Irrigation. With the objective of facilitating the States in mobilising resources for expanding coverage of micro irrigation, a Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) with  corpus of Rs. 5000 crore was created with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) during 2018-19. States may access MIF for special and innovative projects and also for additional incentive to encourage farmers to install Micro Irrigation systems.  To continue the efforts, during the current year, a Budget Announcement was made to double the initial corpus of MIF from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 10,000 crore.(d) : The PMKSY-PDMC focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation. The Micro Irrigation helps in water saving as well as reduced fertilizer usage through fertigation, labour expenses, other input costs and overall income enhancement of farmers. Recent evaluation studies of the scheme have reiterated that Micro Irrigation is relevant in achieving national priorities such as improving on-farm water use efficiency, enhancing crop productivity, generating employment opportunities etc.  (e):	An area of 59.37 lakh ha has been covered under Micro Irrigation  in the country through PMKSY-PDMC from 2015-16 to till date with release of Central Assistance of Rs. 15210.99 crore. The State wise details of coverage of area  and amount released so far is Annexed.
