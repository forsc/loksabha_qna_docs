ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                   (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a):	The State-wise and City-wise details of Tenders/Work Orders issued and Works Completed by Smart Cities are given in Annex-I. (b) to (d): Under the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) launched by the Government of India in June 2015, a total of 100 cities have been selected from across the country for development as Smart Cities. These cities have proposed a total of 5,151 projects at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,05,018 crores in their Smart City Proposals (SCPs). The SCP is a citizen-driven document, prepared after extensive consultations with citizens and other stakeholders to address the unique requirements of the cities and, as such, Government of India had no intervention in selection of these projects by the Cities. While SCM is focused on improving the quality of life, other Missions of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs focus on social sectors and waste management/Water drainage. Social sectors, sanitation, solid waste management are important and essential features of a Smart City. Smart Cities Mission is being executed in convergence with other Missions and programs of the Ministry/State Governments. Provision of core infrastructure like water supply, sewerage and storm water drainage throughout the city is the focus area of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Similarly, core infrastructure projects relating to solid waste management are the focus area under Swachh Bharat Mission(SBM). Some social sectors are addressed under National Urban Livlihood Mission(NULM) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) as well.                    ****
