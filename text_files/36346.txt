                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a)	to (c) Yes, Sir. Indian Railway has developed its own Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System called Kavach for enhancing safety of running trains.  KAVACH has been developed indigenously by RDSO in association with three Indian vendors and it has been adopted as our National Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System.KAVACH will not only aid Loco Pilot to avoid Signal Passing At Danger (SPAD) and over speeding but also help in train running during inclement weather such as dense fog.  Thus, Kavach will enhance safety and efficiency of train operations.The salient features of the said Kavach system are as under-•	Kavach controls speed of the train by automatic application of brakes in case Loco Pilot fails to apply the brakes.•	Repeats line-side signal in cab which is very useful for higher speeds and foggy weather.•	Works on principle of continuous update of Movement authority.•	Auto whistling at LC gates.•	Collision avoidance by direct loco to loco communication.•	Supports feature of SOS in case of any mishap to control train in vicinity. (d) to (f) Yes, Sir. Indian Railway has conducted trials ls of ‘Kavach’ on Absolute Block section of Lingamapalli – Vikarabad - Wadi, Vikarabad -Bidar (250 KM) section of South Central Railway.  After successful completion of trials, three vendors were approved for developmental orders on Indian Railways.On Successful trial a work of Kavach on 1199 RKm is in progress in Manmad – Mudkhed – Dhone – Guntakal & Bidar – Parbhani section of South Central Railway.Till now nearly 1098 Rkm of network route in South Central Railway has been brought under Kavach.(g)	and (h) Total expenditure incurred so far on development work of Kavach is ? 16.88 Crores.At present Kavach roll out is planned on New Delhi-Howrah and New Delhi – Mumbai section which is targeted for completion by Mar’2024.
