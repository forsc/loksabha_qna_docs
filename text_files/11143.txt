                                                        (a) to (c) 	Setting up of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and its operation are in the domain of respective State Governments, whereas preparation of norms and designing curricula along with conducting examination and certification are the responsibility of Central Government.(d) 	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20, is a flagship scheme, under Skill India Mission of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship with an objective to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020 with an outlay of 12,000 crore. The details of total candidates enrolled and trained in the last three years state wise, is given in Annexure I.(e) & (f) 	Yes sir, our country has a smaller percentage of skilled workforce as compared to other countries like United Kingdom, Germany, United State of America, Japan & South Korea. The main reason is the small workforce available with formal skill training, andavailability of skilled or unskilled workforce largely through non-formal channels.The following corrective steps have been taken: -•	Aligning courses as per international standards of National Skill Qualification Frame Work (NSQF).•	Mapping of existing skills, understanding skills gap, imparting necessary remedial measures by re-skilling and up-skilling.•	Imparting training in industry relevant employable skills under various schemes.•	Coverage of new age courses like Internet of Things, Drone Pilot, Geo Informatic Assistant, to keep pace with changing technology and global demand.ANNEXURE -IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARA (d) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION No. 82 DUE FOR REPLY ON 03.02.2020State/UTs	Enrolled	TrainedAndaman and Nicobar Island	1471	1118Andhra Pradesh	198111	190396Arunachal Pradesh	17771	15384Assam	204924	200222Bihar	319599	311219Chandigarh	17318	15076Chhattisgarh	99317	97040Dadra and Nagar Haveli	3000	3000Daman and Diu	4764	4402Delhi	288075	280951Goa	7073	6380Gujarat	247841	237137Haryana	439582	432529Himachal Pradesh	88620	80201Jammu and Kashmir	157813	154213Jharkhand	130418	121845Karnataka	320676	312690Kerala	172632	167930Lakshadweep	90	0Madhya Pradesh	504116	492585Maharashtra	751848	684444Manipur	38869	34221Meghalaya	22192	21051Mizoram	13979	13490Nagaland	12131	10019Odisha	317371	312485Puducherry	16943	15924Punjab	257196	240172Rajasthan	646739	642081Sikkim	7690	7152Tamil Nadu	420347	412402Telangana	232571	227723Tripura	41026	39709Uttar Pradesh	1083536	1059130Uttarakhand	135978	119039West Bengal	303606	293105Total	7,525,233	7256465As on December, 2019.
