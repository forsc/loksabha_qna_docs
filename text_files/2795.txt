(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake development of perspective plans and ensure effective implementation of the programmes/ schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various Schemes/ Programmes.         The strategy of the Government is to focus on farmers’ welfare by making farming viable. The Government has been reorienting the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centric approach as against the earlier production centric policy.  This focuses on achieving high productivity, reduced cost of cultivation and remunerative price on the produce, with a view to earning higher profits for the farmers. A list of various interventions taken by the Government is placed at Annexure -I.   Contd….2/-- 2 -        The Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi aims to provide income support to all farmer families irrespective of the size of their land holdings across the country, by way of payment of Rs.6000/- per year, subject to certain exclusions.  The amount is being released in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/- each over the year, to be credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks through Direct Benefit Transfer mode.        So far, 1st installment to 3,53,73,399 beneficiaries and 2nd installment to 3,10,77,401 beneficiaries have been released.  State-wise data of fund released is at Annexure-II.        With respect to State of Haryana, 1st installment has been released to 9,82,987 beneficiaries and the 2nd installment has been released to 9,35,929 beneficiaries including beneficiaries from Rohtak District of Haryana.
