ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (d):  As per mandate of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UNSDG) Target 14.6, Members are negotiating discipline on fisheries subsidies in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with a view to adopting an agreement on comprehensive and effective disciplines that prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and eliminate subsidies for Illegal, Unreported & Unregulated (IUU) fishing and for fishing of overfished stocks. Inbuilt flexibilities to use conservation and management measures for continuing subsidies is also part of these disciplines.The mandate also provides for appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing country Members. In this context, in these negotiations, India has sought policy space to support low income, resource-poor or livelihood fishing or fishing related activities up to our EEZ, to develop and modernize our fisheries sector and for expanding our fishing activities in the high seas. India has also introduced a document in the WTO on 23 September, 2021, containing ‘Polluter Pays’ principle for fisheries subsidies negotiations, which proposes moratorium on subsidies by distant water fishing nations for fishing and fishing related activities beyond their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and also seeks reduction commitments on distant water fishing capacity by those nations. India is not a distant water fishing nation.******
