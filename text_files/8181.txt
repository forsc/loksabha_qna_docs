ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) As per data captured on the SPIN portal of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), grid connected rooftop solar PV systems of about 1855 MW capacity have been reported installed in the country as on 18.11.2019 (with and without central financial assistance).(b) and (c) The Phase II of Grid Connected Solar Roof Top (GCRT) Programme has targeted installation of grid connected rooftop solar projects of cumulative 40 GW capacity by year 2022. In Phase II of GCRT programme, the Central Financial Assistance (CFA) has been restructured. Now CFA of 40% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost, whichever is lower is provided for residential grid connected rooftop systems upto 3 kW and 20% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems of capacity 3 kW to 10 kW. The CFA for GCRT systems above 10 kW in residential sector is limited to eligible CFA for 10 kW systems  since solar power is cost effective compared to grid tariffs applicable for such category of consumers. The Phase-II of GCRT programme also provides CFA upto 20% of benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower, for Group Housing Societies/ Resident Welfare Associations ( GHS / RWA), for supply of power for common facilities. Under Phase II of GCRT programme Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) have been made implementing agencies as they have direct access to the consumers, have an organised invoicing/billing/execution system and hence are best suited to manage distributed and relatively independent clients/prosumers. Incentives for the State DISCOMs for installingadditional capacity above baseline have also been provided for.(d) The Government is taking a number of steps to ensure large scale commercial production of solar power through rooftop solar plants in the country including rural areas. These include:i.	Under Phase II of GCRT programme, State Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) have been made implementing agencies and CFA is available for residential sector. ii.	Incentives for the State DISCOMs for achievement of additional capacity above baseline capacity. iii.	Persuading states to notify the net/gross metering regulations for RTS projects. Now all the States/UTs State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have notified such regulations and/or tariff orders.iv.	Prepared model MoU, Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and Capex Agreement for expeditious implementation of RTS projects in Govt. Sector.v.	Facilitated availability of concessional loans from World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to SBI and PNB respectively, for disbursal of loans to industrial and commercial sectors, where CFA/incentives are not being provided by the Government.vi.	Assisting States in development/integration of online portal  and aggregation of  demands related to rooftop solar projects.*****
