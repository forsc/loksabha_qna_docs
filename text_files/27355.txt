BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b) A study ‘The burden of chronic respiratory diseases and their heterogeneity across the states of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2016” was published in Lancet 2018 by ICMR. As per the study, the prevalence of Asthma reduced from 3468 per 100000 in 1990 to 3336 per 100000 in 2016 showing a decline of 3.8 percent over a period of 26 years.  (c) Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received in Program Implementation Plans (PIPs) from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation for prevention, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facility for treatment of the given Non-Communicable Diseases including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma.Under NPCDCS, 640 NCD Clinics at District level and 5148 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up to ensure the treatment of common NCDs including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma.Patients with Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma are diagnosed and treated at various tertiary health care facilities such as Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS, etc. The treatment in Government health facilities is either free, or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. The treatment for in-patient care is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) for 10.74 crore families eligible under AB-PMJAY as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) database.Under Free Drugs Service Initiative of NHM, financial support is provided to States/UTs for provision of free essential medicines. Furthermore, quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana in collaboration with the State Governments.Preventive aspect of NCDs including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma is being strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centers, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. NPCDCS gives financial support under NHM for awareness generation (IEC) activities to be undertaken by the States/UTs as per their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs), subject to resource envelope.Further, in order to accelerate actions for reducing deaths due to Childhood Pneumonia (ARI), an initiative named “Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS)” has been launched in 2019 under Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) program under the aegis of NHM. National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has also prepared and shared Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials on Air Pollution as a risk factor for ARI, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) and Asthma, and shared it with all the States/UTs.
