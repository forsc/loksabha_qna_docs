                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d) : ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Maintenance of law and order, protection of life and property of citizens including prevention of crime against women and children is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Nevertheless, giving high priority to safety of women and children, the Central Government has also taken a number of initiatives in this regard during the last six months. The Government has ensured that their schemes of One Stop Centres (OSCs), Universalisation of Women Help Line (WHL), Ujjawala Homes, Swadhar Greh, Child Care Institutions, Child Line (1098), Emergency Response Support System (112) and various authorities under women and child centric laws such as  ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006’, ‘The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012’ etc. remain operational and available for providing assistance to women and children during the period. The Government has also undertaken sensitisation programs for the concerned officials of States and UTs for this purpose.*******
