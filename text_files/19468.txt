                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		DBT performance ranking of States/UTs was released by DBT Mission in February, 2020 on DBT Bharat Portal. The ranking was based on 8 parameters viz. State Aadhar Act, Aadhar Saturation, CSS identification, Portal compliance, Data reporting, Saving reporting compliance, Saving Expenditure Ratio and DBT Per Capita, where State of West Bengal got 36th rank. (b):		The reasons for failure are mostly due to mismatched bank details of beneficiaries, dormant/closed accounts, inactive Aadhar and non-mapping of account with Aadhar etc.(c) & (d):	Details of DBT transaction failure and value of failed transactions for last two years i.e. 2019-20 and 2020-21 is Annexed. The issues relating to transaction failures are regularly taken up with the O/o Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and DBT Mission. At the instance of DBT Mission, Department of Financial Services (DFS) pursues the issue of transaction failures under different DBT schemes with Banks, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). As a result, DBT transaction failure rate has been reduced from 5% in the year 2019-20 to 4.6% in the year 2020-21.*                                                                *******
