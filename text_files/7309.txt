                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES                             (SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):	No spinning mill (cotton or man-made fibre) in Odisha has been closed in non-small-scale industry (Non-SSI) in recent years as per the information maintained by the Office of Textile Commissioner, Mumbai.  However, 12 Non-SSI textile mills had been closed in the state of Odisha during 1993-2010 as per details provided in the Annexure. In addition to the above, National Textile Corporation Ltd. (NTC) has one unit at Bhagatpur which has no production activity since 2002. NTC paid attractive compensation package to 354 employees at the cost of Rs. 12.13 crores under Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme between 2005 to 2010. (c):	There is no proposal for revival of private closed spinning mills at present. However, the Government is implementing several schemes to support the Textile Industry which include the Amended Technology Up gradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS); Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP); Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS); Technology Mission on Technical Textiles (TMTT) etc. The industry could avail benefits under the above schemes for upgrading/ reviving textile units.
