However, keeping in view the administrative exigency of work, efficiency and economy of operations and unavoidable circumstances, outsourcing for services through contract is also sometimes resorted to.	There are detailed procedures laid down for procurement of such non-consulting or outsourced services, including through e-procurement, in the “General Financial Rules, 2017 (GFR 2017), and the “Manual for Procurement of Consultancy & Other Services, 2017”. 	Statutory and contractual obligations to be complied with in respect of the contractor’s employees engaged for provision of services to Government are governed by the applicable Labour Laws such as Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, Minimum Wages Act, 1948, Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 etc.  	Protection of the interests of contractors’ employees  under these laws, is enforced by the Government through the Office of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) [CLC©] which carries out inspections for the purpose , so as to regulate the employment of contract labour, payment of minimum wages and welfare, etc of employees engaged by the contractors for providing service.******
