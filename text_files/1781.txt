ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)  to (c):	Economic Survey 2016-17 (Vol. II) has opined that the overall agricultural labour productivity of India in terms of Gross Value Addition (GVA) per worker is less than a third of that in China. International comparison of many economic variables is problematic as it tends to ignore the complex dimensions of production or value addition processes or consumption. Even Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries are not strictly comparable by using international currencies like US Dollar and the accepted measure of GDP for international comparisons is the GDP measured on purchasing power parity basis.As such, GVA per worker is an inappropriate measure of agriculture production as varied agricultural inputs, agro-ecological zones and a number of socio-economic factors influence productivity. Agriculture productivity is normally measured in terms of agriculture output per hectare of land. Indian being a large country, there are large inter regional variations in output per hectare of land due to agro-climatic and other contexts. Contd…2/--2-Given the above caveats, India is ranked 23rd among Asian countries in cereal productivity while 39th in pulse productivity based on latest 2017 data of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, these rankings do not take into account various other factors that influence and impact productivity.	In order to increase production and productivity of agricultural crops in the country, Government of India is implementing through State Governments, several Crop Development Schemes/Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card etc. 	Under these Schemes / Programmes, funds are provided to States for implementation of State-specific agricultural strategies including incentives to farmers for use of quality seeds, improve soil health under Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), farm mechanization, etc. The States are also provided support for creation of agricultural infrastructure for optimal use of water and other natural resources.Further, to achieve higher agricultural productivity, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is conducting basic and strategic research relating to crop improvement, production and protection technologies suitable to different situations including development of location-specific varieties/hybrids and technologies.  *******
