                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	  Works sanctioned under  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) in Rajasthan in the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21 are as under:   Scheme 	Year of Sanction	No. of Roads	Length in km	No. of Bridges	Cost in Rs.                                                                                             crorePMGSY III	  2019-20	            237	         2198.38	   0	        1139.06	          2020-21	            374	         3622.98	   6	        1982.59(b)	 As reported by the State, all the proposals sanctioned during 2019-20 and 2020-21 were placed before Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads for approval. Public representatives of Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads have recommended these works in their respective General Assemblies. (c)  Yes Sir.(d) Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has an inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives. Relevant paras of PMGSY-III guidelines in this respect are given below:Para 3.6: …The State shall place the District Rural Road Plan (DRRP) (including all Block Level Rural Roads Plans i.e. BRRPs) before the Intermediate Panchayat for consideration and approval. It would be simultaneously sent, along with the list of all candidate Through Routes/ Major Rural Links to the Members of Parliament (MPs), for their comments, if any. After approval by the Intermediate Panchayat, the Plans would be placed before the District Panchayat for its approval. It will be incumbent on the District Panchayat to ensure that the suggestions given by the Members of Parliament are given full consideration within the framework of these Guidelines.  Once approved by the District Panchayat, a copy of the DRRP would be sent to the State Level Standing Committee (SLSC) and after its approval to the State-level Rural Roads Development Agency (SRRDA) as well as the National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA). The State shall finalize the draft DRRP uploaded on Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS). No road work shall be included in the Comprehensive Upgradation cum Consolidation Priority List (CUCPL) unless it forms part of the approved DRRP. The same should also be uploaded on OMMAS website. No road work shall be included in the final Candidate Road List as well as CUCPL unless it forms part of the approved DRRP and the Candidate Road List will be allowed to be uploaded after DRRP has been finalized and approved on OMMAS website. Para 5.5: The Annual proposals will be based on the CUCPL following the Order of Priority [subject to Pavement Condition Index (PCI)]. However, it is possible that there are inadvertent errors or omissions, particularly in the selection of Through Routes. Accordingly, it is desirable to also associate public representatives while finalizing the selection of road works in the annual proposals. The proposals of the Members of Parliament are required to be given full consideration, for this purpose:  (i) The CUCPL should be sent to concerned MPs with the request that their proposals on the selection of works out of the CUCPL should be sent to the District Panchayat. It is suggested that at least 15 clear days may be given for the purpose. (ii) In order to ensure that the prioritisation has some reference to the funding available, the size of proposals expected may also be indicated to the Members of Parliament while forwarding the CUCPL list to them. District wise allocation may be indicated to enable choice with the requisite geographical spread.  It would be ensured that such proposals of Members of Parliament which adhere to the Order of Priority would be invariably accepted subject to consideration of equitable allocation of funds and need for upgradation.  (iii)       The proposals received from the Members of Parliament by the stipulated date would be given full consideration in the District Panchayat which would record the reason in each case of non-inclusion. Such proposals that cannot be included would be communicated in writing to the Members of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposals in each case. It would be preferable if the communication is issued from the Nodal Department at a senior level.Para 7.1: After approval by the District Panchayat, the proposals would be forwarded by the Programme Implementation Unit (PIU) to the SRRDA. The PIU will at that time prepare the details of proposals forwarded by the Members of Parliament, and action taken thereon, in Proforma MP-I and MP–II and send it along with the proposals. In all cases, where the proposal of an MP has not been included, cogent reasons shall be given based on the reasons given by the District Panchayat.Para 7.2: The SRRDA shall vet the proposals to ensure that they are in accordance with the Guidelines and shall place them before the State-level Standing Committee along with the MP-I and MP-II Statements.Para 7.3: The State Level Standing Committee (SLSC) would scrutinize the proposals to see that they are in accordance with the Guidelines and that the proposals of the Members of Parliament have been given full consideration. After scrutiny by the State Level Standing Committee, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) will prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for each proposed road work in accordance with the Manual for preparing the DPRs and instructions issued by the NRIDA from time to time.In order to ensure that the State Governments give due attention to the laid down provisions of the guidelines while submitting the proposals to the Ministry of Rural Development for sanction, the Ministry has issued a fresh advisory to the States on  2nd June, 2020. The State Governments have been advised, inter-alia, to communicate the final list of proposals to Members of Parliament and obtain their consent in writing before the Ministry approves those proposals. A copy of the advisory is attached in Annexure.*****                      File No. P-17025/37/2013-RC (FMS No 331916)                                 Government of India                           Ministry of Rural Development                           Department of Rural Development                         (Rural Connectivity (RC) Division)	                                                           Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi                                                                    Dated the 2nd June, 2020	All Additional Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries In-Charge of PMGSY of all the States/UTsSubject: Role of Hon’ble Members of Parliament in planning and selection of road works under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana-III- reg.Sir/ Madam,1 am directed to refer to the subject cited above and to say that the PMGSY has an inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at various stages of planning and implementation of the programme. Advisories have been issued and reiterated from time to time to the State Governments/State Rural Road Development Agencies, giving emphasis, inter-alia, on strict compliance of these provisions. In this regard, attention is invited again to various provisions of the PMGSY-III guidelines, which provide detailed procedure for consultation with the Members of Parliament during the process of planning and selection of roads. Some important guidelines in this respect are reproduced below:Para 3.6: The suggestions given by the Members of Parliament are to be given full consideration while finalizing District Rural Roads Plan (DRRP).Para 5.5: The Annual proposals will be based on the CUCPL following the Order of Priority (subject to PCl). However, it is possible that there are inadvertent errors or omissions, particularly in the selection of Through Routes. Accordingly, it is desirable to also associate public representatives while finalizing the selection of road works in the annual proposals. The proposals of the Members of Parliament arc required to be given full consideration, for this purpose:i.	The CUCPL should be sent to concerned MPs with the request that their proposals on the selection of works out of the CUCPL should be sent to the District Panchayat. It is suggested that at least 15 clear days may be given for the purpose.ii.	In order to ensure that the prioritization has some reference to the funding available, the size of proposals expected may also be indicated to the Members of Parliament while forwarding the CUCPL list to them. District wise allocation may be indicated to enable choice with the requisite geographical spread. It would be ensured that such proposals of Members of Parliament which adhere to the Order of Priority would be invariably accepted subject to consideration of equitable allocation of funds and need for up gradation.iii.	The proposals received from the Members of Parliament by the stipulated date would be given full consideration in the District Panchayat which would record the reason in each case of non-inclusion. Such proposals that cannot be included would be communicated in writing to the Members of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposals in each case. It would be preferable if the communication is issued from the Nodal Department at a senior level.Para 7.1:   After the approval by the District Panchayat, the proposals would be forwarded by the PIU to the SRRDA. The PIU will at that time prepare the details of proposals forwarded by the Members of Parliament and action taken thereon, in proforma MP-1 and MP-II and sent it along with proposals. In all cases where the proposals of an MP has not been included, cogent reasons shall be given based on the reasons given by the District Panchayat.Para 7.3:  The State Level Standing Committee (SLSC) would scrutinize the proposals  to see that they are in accordance with the Guidelines and that the proposals of the Member of Parliament have been given full consideration.2.	In view of this, all the State Governments are once again requested to follow the guidelines relating to consultation with the Members of Parliament in letter and spirit, and the following needs to be ensured:(i)	Hon’ble MPs may be briefed about the PMGSY-III planning process, overall allocation and inter-se Block/District allocation etc. at the beginning of the planning exercise.(ii)	Hence, it is reiterated that final list of proposals, in order of priority, would be communicated in writing to the Member of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposals in each case. It would be preferable if this communication is made by a senior official and their recommendation/ consent be ‹obtained in writing on the overall proposed list. It should be ensured that the Member of Parliament receives such communication and a reasonable time of 15 days is given to them to respond with their recommendation.(iii)	Such recommendation should also be included along with MP-I and MP-II formats. If such response/ recommendation is not received in 15 days, a clear note to this effect is recorded in the proposal. Proposal to the Ministry may be sent by SRRDA along with a note regarding the process adopted by the state in dealing with the recommendations of Members of Parliament.                                                                         Yours faithfully,                                                                            (K.M. Singh)                                                   Deputy Secretary to the Government of India                                                                      Tel No: 011- 2307 0308
