A Central Sector Scheme for Promotion of Information Education and Communication (IEC) in AYUSH has been devised by the Ministry of AYUSH for this purpose. Under this Scheme, the Ministry of AYUSH takes up initiatives to create awareness about and to promote AYUSH systems of medicine. These initiatives include organizing Arogya Fairs, Melas, Conferences, Exhibitions, Seminars, Workshops, Symposium and Ayurveda Parvs. The IEC Scheme also supports undertaking publicity campaigns through electronic media, print media and social media amongst the citizens in the country, for encouraging AYUSH Systems including traditional Indian systems of medicine.Contd……..-2-The Ministry also observes days dedicated to AYUSH Systems of Medicine viz. International Day of Yoga, Ayurveda Day, Unani Day, Siddha Day, Naturopathy Day, Homoeopathy Day etc. to create awareness about the benefits of the respective AYUSH system of medicine.(c):     Traditional systems of medicines do not offer any guaranteed cure for cancer and heart ailments.

Further, under the ambit of the IEC Scheme, activities to popularise AYUSH medicines for the treatment of lifestyle diseases are also taken up.(d):	 Yes. Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) under the Ministry of AYUSHhas set up 4 modern laboratories for advance research in Ayurveda, with details as given in Annexure.(e) & (f):    No information in this matter is maintained by the Ministry as subjects like public health and related matters come under the purview of governments of States and UTs.…………………..
