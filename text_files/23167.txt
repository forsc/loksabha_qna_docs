ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with such other proposals under the “Challenge Method”. KVs are not opened on the criteria of District-wise.  The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) have informed that 59 KVs in 20 districts and 34 JNVs (including 2nd JNV in Nandurbar District) in 33 districts (as on 31.5.2014) are functioning in the State of Maharashtra. (c)	The vacancies of teaching posts in KVs and JNVs as on 31st December, 2020 are 8174 and 3414 respectively. Filling up of vacancies is a continuous process and action is taken from time to time as per the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules.  As the process of filling up of vacancies involves various methods of recruitment such as promotion, Limited Departmental Examination, Direct Recruitment etc. and takes time, no specific time frame for filling up of vacant posts can be given at this stage. Teachers are also engaged on contractual basis for temporary duration by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to ensure that the teaching-learning process is not hampered.(d) & (e) Ministry of Education is implementing various Educational Schemes/Projects across the country including Maharashtra. Details of major Schemes / Projects as well as funds allocated / released during the year 2019-2020 are annexed.                                                                    *****
