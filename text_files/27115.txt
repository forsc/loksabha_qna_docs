                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (b) Yes, Sir. The Government has published the draft Drone Rules, 2021 on 15 July 2021 in the Gazette of India.  The draft Drone Rules, 2021 cover various aspects of drone usage viz, registration, ownership, transfer, import, operation of drone traffic management, payment of fees and penalties etc. All civilian drone activities will be regulated under these rules.;Some of the key measures proposed therein, include the following: ;i.  Various authorisations, licenses, permits, certificates and approvals are proposed to be abolished.  These include - unique authorisation number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, import clearance, operator permit, authorisation of R&D organisation, student remote pilot licence, remote pilot instructor authorisation, drone port authorisation etc. ;;;ii.  Certificate of airworthiness, unique identification number and prior flight permission are proposed to be abolished for R&D entities.  iii.  The ''Digital sky platform'' shall be developed as a business friendly single-window online system.  There will be minimal human interface on digital sky platform and most permissions will be self-generated.  iv.  Various fees have been abolished or significantly rationalised.  The proposed fees have no linkage with size of the drone.;v.  An interactive airspace map with green, yellow and red zones will be displayed on the digital sky platform for the ease of drone operators. ;vi.  No flight permission will be required up to 400 feet in green zones and up to 200 feet in the area between 8 and 12 km from the airport perimeter;;vii.  No pilot licence will be required for micro drones (for non-commercial use), nano drone and for R&D organisations.;viii.  The coverage of drones under Drone Rules, 2021 is proposed to be increased from 300 kg to 500 kg.  This will cover drone taxis also.;;ix.The number of forms are proposed to be reduced from 25 to 5.(c) Yes, Sir.  In order to counter the threat of non-compliant drones in the country, necessary Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) have been issued on 10 May 2019 by Ministry of Home Affairs, which include measures to be taken by the Central and the State Governments, in consultation with security agencies.;;(d) The measures proposed under draft Drone Rules, 2021 are expected to increase the ease of doing drone business in India. The draft Rules envisage a Drone Promotion Council comprising industry experts and academicians for, inter-alia, development of a business-friendly regulatory regime and establishment of incubators and other facilities for the development of drone technologies.  This may enable greater use of drones across various sectors like agriculture, mining, healthcare, geospatial mapping, media & entertainment, infrastructure projects etc, to name a few.
