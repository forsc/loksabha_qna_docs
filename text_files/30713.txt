Compensation scheme for sterilization acceptors which provides compensation for loss of wages to the beneficiary and also to the service provider team for conducting sterilization.  4.	Post-partum Intrauterine contraceptive device (PPIUCD) services are provided post delivery.5.	Scheme for Home Delivery of contraceptives by ASHAs at doorstep of beneficiaries has been taken up.6.	Family Planning Logistics Management Information System (FP-LMIS): A dedicated software has been launched to ensure smooth forecasting, procurement and distribution of family planning commodities across all the levels of health facilities.As a result of these efforts, for India, •	The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) declined to 2.0 in 2019-20 (NFHS 5) which is below replacement level. •	31 out of 36 States/ UTs have achieved replacement level fertility (NFHS 5).•	The Modern Contraceptive usage has increased to 56.5% (NFHS 5).•	The Unmet Need for Family Planning has declined to 9.4% (NFHS 5).•	The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) has declined to 19.7 in 2019 (SRS).
