Upgrades are done on commercial considerations;  These up-grades are done subject to availability of higher class seats and payment of the prescribed amount by the passengers opting for up-gradation, where ever applicable.  ; (b): The details regarding the number of paid upgrades and revenue generated therefrom by Air India across the country during each of the last three years and the current year are as follows :  Financial Year                        Number of Upgrade       Revenue (Rs. in crores)   2016-17                                         36513                             84.74   2017-18                                         55370                             111.57   2018-19                                         74340                             183.37  2019-20(till December 2019)         70097                             118.74 ; (c); Criteria and norms for up-gradation of tickets are commercial business decision of Air India and Government has not issued any direction for the same. Further, CVC had referred a complaint to Air India in May 2018 regarding irregularities on Up-gradation of  tickets between January, 2014 and May, 2014. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) consisting of three CVOs was also constituted by CVC in December, 2018 which submitted its report to CVC in January, 2019. In the report, it was found out that there were some cases of Up-gradations which were done by the check-in staff without assigning any reasons. For the remaining cases, they were found to be justified as they had been done on the basis of over-bookings, upfront up-gradation scheme and authorized upgrades as per policy.  The report of SIT was accepted by CVC in May, 2019.  Thereafter Air India has taken measure to maintain complete transparency and strict adherence of the laid down Standard Operating Procedure by one and all in up-gradation of seats.  (d) The upgrades are done subject to availability of seats in the higher class. The upgrade at the airport are done on First Come First Served Basis when the passengers present themselves at the check-in counter.;  (e) The Government is committed to the disinvestment of Air India. In order to effectively prepare Air India for disinvestment, the Government prepared a plan to bring operational and financial efficiency in Air India. This Plan focuses on the financial and operational efficiencies so that substantial increase in revenue or cost saving could be achieved. Also, operational and financial performance parameters and milestones as fixed by the Government are regularly being reviewed.
