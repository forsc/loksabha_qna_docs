Till date 14 States have given their comments.  The Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its 146th Report dated 23.06.2010, had recommended that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System of the country.   Earlier, the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 111th   and 128th Report had also stressed upon the need to reform and rationalise the criminal law of the country by introducing a comprehensive legislation in Parliament rather than bring about piece meal amendments in respective Acts.  The Government agrees with the recommendations of the Department related- Standing Committee on Home Affairs.
