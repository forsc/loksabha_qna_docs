ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a)to(e) Ministry of Finance,  Department of Economic Affairs’s  Budget division has informed that no such reference has been received. The MNRE has also not received any such demand.  Further, collections from National Clean Energy Cess on coal were transferred to National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF). Allocation to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy was made from NCEF up to 2017-18 for implementation of various RE related schemes. Since Clean Energy Cess was subsumed in Goods and Services Tax (GST), funding from NCEF was discontinued after 2017-18. Now all MNRE schemes are funded from gross budgetary support.
