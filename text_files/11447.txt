ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILZERS.(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b). Yes, Sir.  Government approved revival of Talcher unit of FCIL by formation of Joint Venture/ Special Purpose Vehicles of nominated PSUs for manufacturing of urea through Coal Gasification route.  Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited (RCF), Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and Coal India Limited (CIL) entrusted PDIL to carry out a feasibility report for production of Ammonia through coal gasification route.  Expression of Interest (EOI) was floated to various coal gasification process licensors for technical details to carry out technology selection for coal gasification and feasibility report preparation for Ammonia/ Urea production.  Subsequently as desired by TFL and NITI Aayog, a nominated Committee of experts of Coal Gasification and other stakeholders which are CIL, GAIL and RCF carried out independent “Technical Due Diligence” of Coal Gasification technology. After elaborative discussions held among the Committee members, all the technical experts expressed their confidence and satisfaction on Shell (Air Products) Coal Gasification Technology.  NITI Aayog has also constituted an Apex Committee on Methanol Economy and five Task Forces including Task Force on production of Methanol using high ash coal. (c) & (d).  As per TFL, the coal gasification based Talcher plant shall produce syngas which will substitute natural gas as feed stock/fuel for manufacture of urea . India is a net importer of natural gas and successful implementation of this project can lead to reduction of import of natural gas. The NITI Aayog constituted Task Force on production of methanol using high ash coal, in its report, stated that Methanol usage as a fuel and its gasoline blend has potential to reduce import of oil.                                                               *********
