(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme has become operational w.e.f. 01-12-2018 with a view to provide income support to all eligible landholder farmers’ families of the country, irrespective of the size of their land holding, subject to certain exclusions  relating to higher income strata. Under the Scheme, benefit is provided to the eligible beneficiary to the tune of Rs.6000/- per year, payable in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000/- each.  The payment is made online directly into the bank accounts of the eligible beneficiaries under Direct Benefit Transfer mode.  The cut-off date for identification of beneficiaries with regard to their eligibility is    01-02-2019.  Contd….2/-- 2 -(b):	Yes Sir. The responsibility of identifying the landholder farmer family eligible for benefit under the scheme and uploading the data of the eligible beneficiaries on the PM-KISAN Portal is that of the State/UT Government.  The details of beneficiaries uploaded by the States including Tamil Nadu is given at Annexure-I.(c):	The State-wise details of beneficiaries who have been benefited under PM-KISAN, is given at Annexure –II. Unlike other Schemes, under PM-KISAN, funds are not allocated and ear-marked state-wise because it is a continuous and ongoing scheme, in which the financial benefits is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal. So far, out of an allocated amount of Rs.75,000 crore for the FY 2019-20, around Rs.27,937.26 crore has been spent up to 31-10-2019, which includes Administrative Expenses given to the States.   (d) : 	1. State of West Bengal has not provided any data of beneficiaries.2. Some States have joined late and some are slow in providing data of beneficiaries.3.  The correction of data by State authorities is taking time.(e):	Under PM-KISAN, the funds are not released State-wise.  However, the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified eligible beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer.  The payment status of beneficiaries to register under PM-KISAN is at Annexure-III.(f):	Funds are released as soon as the data of beneficiaries is verified by the State/UT Government.
