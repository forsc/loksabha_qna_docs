ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	Mission Antyodaya is a framework of convergence and accountability. Under the framework, a country-wide Gram Panchayat (GP) level Survey has been undertaken to find out the development gap in certain parameters in GPs so that the same can be bridged through the preparation and implementation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP). Apart from this, Mission Antyodaya framework seeks to converge Government interventions with GP as the basic unit for better planning and more efficient use of available resources with a saturation approach targeting mitigation of multi-dimensional poverty. For bringing overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance, infrastructure development in rural areas, Department of Rural Development has been implementing various Schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY),  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM). Under Rashritya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) of Ministry of Panchayati Raj, viability gap funding for micro projects catering to subjects enlisted in Eleventh Schedule taken up by GPs/ cluster of GPs for economic development and income enhancement in the Panchayat area is also provided. While MGNREGS is a demand-driven Programme, PMAY-G aims at Housing for All by 2022. In particular, DAY-NRLM seeks to reach out to all rural poor households in a phased manner and impact their livelihoods significantly through following three sub-components- •	Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) aims to meet the specific needs of women farmers to enable them to achieve socio economic empowerment, as also create and sustain agriculture based livelihoods of rural women. •	Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) has the objective of helping Self Help Group (SHG) and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector. •	Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY) provides safe, affordable and community monitored transport services in rural areas.*****
