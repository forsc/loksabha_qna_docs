ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	to (b): 	The Ministry of Minority Affairs disburses Pre-Matric, Post Matric and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarships for the educational empowerment of students belonging economically weaker section of the six notified minority communities i.e. Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Muslim, Parsi and Sikh. As per the guidelines of these Schemes- a beneficiary studying in a particular class in an academic year is awarded the scholarship for the said class during the same academic year. Accordingly the scholarships under these Schemes are directly credited to the beneficiary account under Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) mode through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) within the academic year. The scholarships that remain unpaid during an academic year, due to technical reasons like payment failure, delay in bank validation or delay by the Sates in digitally signing of the payment files, are credited to the beneficiary accounts in the succeeding academic year after rectification/ signing of payment files by the States.  *****
