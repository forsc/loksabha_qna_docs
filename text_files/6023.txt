Under the Phase-I of this Scheme, one medical college has been approved in Gondia, Maharashtra at a cost of Rs.189 crore to be shared between Centre and State in the ratio of 60:40. This medical college has become functional. Further, under the Phase-II of the Scheme, an analysis was done to ensure the availability of at least one medical college for every 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and at least 1 Government Medical College in each State of the country. Accordingly, mapping was done and requirement of 24 new medical colleges under Phase-II of the Scheme has been identified. Amravati, Maharashtra already has a private medical college in the name of Dr. Panjabrao Alias Bhausaheb Deshmukh Memorial Medical College and hence it can not be considered under the Scheme. ******
