ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	The GCC countries have been following a policy of nationalisation since the last few years, which broadly aims at increasing the employment opportunities of their citizens both in the public and private sectors, by reducing dependence on the expatriate workers. The expatriates are restricted from working in a few job sectors in most of these countries.However, the policy is not specifically directed at Indian nationals. GCC countries are following this policy uniformly in respect of all foreign nationalities. These efforts of the GCC countries have of late gained momentum after the ongoing slowdown of the economy due to continued low crude oil prices. The job losses occurring in the last few years were mainly due to some companies facing economic problems.Government is working in close coordination with the GCC countries towards safeguarding the interests and welfare of the resident Indian community. Indian workers in companies affected by economic downturn in the Gulf region have been extended assistance through waiver of fines on Iqama (resident permit) related violations, providing exit visas and one way return tickets to India as well as transfer of sponsorship, wherever possible, on gratis basis. Government has also extended necessary support to facilitate return of Indian nationals who have availed Amnesty offers in GCC countries.(c) to (e) As regards Indian nationals who have lost their jobs and returning to India, responsibility for their resettlement primarily rests with the State Governments. Government stands ready to extend necessary cooperation to States in this regard.***
