ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) & (b):	Instances of sub-standard and adulterated milk sold in the market have come to the notice of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). As implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 primarily lies with State/UT Governments, Commissioners of Food Safety of State/UTs are regularly conducting surveillance and enforcement drives to curb the adulteration in milk and milk products. As per the data shared by the States/UTs, the details of samples of milk analysed and penal action taken by the State enforcement authorities  for the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 are at                      Annexure I, II and III.   FSSAI had also conducted National Milk Safety and Quality Survey, 2018. Overall, above 93% of the samples that is 5976 out of 6,432 samples were found to be safe for human consumption. 12 out of 6432 samples, that is 0.2% of the samples were adulterated with harmful substances like hydrogen peroxide, detergents, urea and neutraliser. A major finding in the survey was presence of aflatoxin M1 residues beyond permissible limits in 368 out of 6,432 samples, that is 5.7% of the samples. The survey further showed that 77 out of 6,432 samples, that 1.2% of the samples had residues of antibiotics above the permissible limits. Only one raw milk sample was found to contain pesticide residue above the permissible level. However, on the quality parameters, 41% of the samples though safe, were less in fat and/or solid-not-fat (SNF) rendering the milk sub-standard.  Presence of other two quality parameters viz maltodextrin in 156 out of 6432 samples and sugar in 78 out of 6432 samples were mainly confined to processed milk. The survey did not find any non-compliance on account of other parameters viz. cellulose, glucose, starch and vegetable oil in the collected samples.  (c):	No such data is available.(d) & (e):	Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection are being carried out by the Officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check compliance of the provisions laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. In cases where the samples are found to be non-conforming, penal action is being taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators (FBOs). FSSAI has advised the State Food Safety authorities to  (a)  maintain a strict vigil on milk chilling units to eliminate the chances of adulteration or production of any spurious milk entering into the milk value chain (b) intensity surveillance during festive seasons when demand of milk and milk products increases (c) follow a policy of periodic transfers in respect of Food Safety Officers (FSOs) to prevent development of collusion  and (d) generate local intelligence regarding the malpractices which expectedly will be more prevalent at local levels, strengthen testing and enforcement infrastructure both physical as well as human to ensure that a strict surveillance is maintained to check the malpractices of adulteration effectively.  FSSAI has developed and released a harmonized Scheme of Testing and Inspection (STI) to be adopted by dairy processing plants for the purpose of monitoring and self compliance throughout their production chain in order to strengthen their internal controls. All dairy processing plants are required to maintain appropriate records of testing which would be verified during surveillance visits /inspections. FSSAI had provided Electronic Milk Analyser and Tester (EMAT) Machines to State/UT Governments. Further, mobile food testing vans given to State/UTs have been equipped with Milk-o-Screen machines for on-the spot analysis of milk samples. Further, FSSAI has started providing the States/UTs with portable/handheld type rapid screening device, namely RAPTOR. This machine can semi-quantitatively determine antibiotics of concern in milk and aflatoxin M1 in milk. To build up trust of consumers in safety and quality of milk, consumer awareness and engagement programs are being organised throughout the country. This includes dissemination of details about DART book and magic box containing sample tests to be performed at home to check adulteration in milk and Consumer guidance note on milk products which has been uploaded on website of FSSAI.
