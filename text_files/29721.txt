ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c) Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily tocater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central GovernmentEmployees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies,Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning(IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of newKVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Governmentof India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committingresources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoringauthorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have tocompete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject toapproval of the competent authority.At present, 62 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs), including 03 in Malda district, arefunctional in West Bengal. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has not received anyproposal in prescribed proforma for opening of a new KV in Samsi, Malda, UttarParliament Constituency from the State Government of West Bengal.(d) to (f) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good qualitymodern education to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All thedistricts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States / UTs which have accepted the scheme,have been covered. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends onthe willingness of the concerned State Government / UT administration to makeavailable requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent buildingand making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya tillthe permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of newJNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.Out of total 20 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) sanctioned in the State ofWest Bengal, 19 have already been established and remaining 01 JNV in Malda districtis non-functional for want of suitable temporary accommodation and transfer of land infavour of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti by the State Government.*****
