This contraction reflects the unparalleled effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic. The fundamentals of the economy remain strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns, along with the astute support of Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery from the second half of FY 2020-21.(b) In FY 2020-21, Government had announced a special economic and comprehensive package of Rs. 29.87 lakh crore under AtmaNirbhar Bharat (ANB) to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to revive economic growth and to bolster employment. Union Budget 2021-22 has announced number of measures to support broad-based and inclusive economic development including a 34.5 percent increase in capital expenditure and 137 percent increase in health expenditure. Government announced a relief package of Rs. 6.29 lakh crore in June 2021 to strengthen public health and provide impetus for growth and employment measures.(c) and (d) No Sir. *****
