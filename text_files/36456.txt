                                                        THE MINISTER OF AYUSH (SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a)& (b)	The Ministry of Ayush is implementing the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the National AYUSH Mission (NAM) through State/UT Governments including Bihar. Under the NAM, provisions have been madefor financial assistance for setting up of 50/30/10 bedded integrated AYUSH hospital including Yoga & Naturopathy and establishment of new AYUSH Colleges including Yoga & Naturopathy in the States where availability of AYUSH teaching institutions is inadequate in Government Sector. Accordingly, State/UT Governments may avail the financial assistance by submitting the proposal through State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) as per the NAM guidelines.However, Public Health being a State subject, setting up of AYUSH Hospital and Research Institute and Yoga Teaching and Training Centre comes under the purview of the respective State/UT Governments. Under NAM, there is no provision ofsetting up of Research Institute. Further, no proposal has been received from State Government of Bihar for setting up of AYUSH Hospital and establishment of new AYUSH Collegein Darbhangathrough State Annual Action Plan.
