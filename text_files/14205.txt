(a)  The Expert Group under the Chairmanship of Shri B.K. Chaturvedi, the then member, Planning Commission constituted by the Government for restructuring and strengthening of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) had recommended setting up of an Aerospace University.	A Detailed Project Report (DPR) on establishment of Aerospace University was prepared by a HAL-established Society named ‘Society for HAL Aeronautics Research & Technologies Institute’ and approved by HAL Board.	Subsequently, the DPR was reviewed in this Ministry and it was suggested that for the formation of the Institute through an Act of Parliament, the structure should be in line with relevant Rules, Regulations & Procedures in vogue in other Central Universities/Institutes.  HAL’s role would be facilitating the establishment of the proposed University and providing secretarial help.	After deliberation in their 409th Board Meeting held on 02.02.2018, HAL has decided that they cannot consider setting up an Aerospace University, even in collaboration with the other Organisations like DRDO, Private Industries, etc.(b) to (d):  Does not arise in view of (a) above.*****
