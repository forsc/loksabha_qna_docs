                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c):  Yes, Sir. The Department of School Education and Literacy is implementing the scheme of Vocationalisation of School Education under the umbrella of  ‘Samagra Shiksha - an integrated scheme for school education’, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme. The scheme aims at integrating Vocational Education with general academic education in all Secondary/Senior Secondary schools; enhancing the Employability and Entrepreneurial abilities of the students, providing exposure to work environment; and generating awareness amongst students about various career options so as to enable them to make a choice in accordance with their aptitude, competence and aspirations.  The scheme covers Government and Government aided schools. Under Vocational Education component of ‘Samagra Shiksha’, National Skills Qualifications Framework  (NSQF) compliant vocational courses in different sectors such as Agriculture, Apparels, Beauty and Wellness, IT-ITes, Automotive, Tourism and Hospitality, Construction, etc are offered to the boy and girl students from class 9th to 12th in the schools covered under the scheme. 	Till March 2021, 12813 schools have been approved under the scheme out of which the scheme has so far been implemented in 11,710 schools with the reported enrolment of more than 15 lakh students, out of which around 8.16 lakh are girl students.Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) focuses on inclusive skill development, with the objective of increased women participation for better economic productivity. The Ministry through its various schemes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS), Craftsmanship Training Scheme (CTS) and Craft Instructor Training Scheme (CITS) provide skill development training to all sections of people including women. In order to increase the participation of woman under PMKVY, conveyance cost and boarding and lodging facilities are being provided.The Directorate General of Training (DGT) of MSDE, under its Craftsmanship Training Scheme (CTS), has imparted long-term vocational training through a network of 14,604 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). Government has made a provision of 30% reservation of seats for women candidates all over the country in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Industrial Training Centers (ITCs) for promoting women participation in skill training encouraging them through enrolling in various Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in various trades under Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS) all over the country.The Government has in place the policy to develop the teaching process in the way of training of trainer’s development programme under Craft Instructor Training Scheme (CITS) and conducts the programme in 19 National Skill Training Institutes (Women) exclusively for women in 15 states /UTs of India.MSDE is also administering the Scheme of support to Jan Shikshan Sansthans (NGOs) for Skill Development. The mandate of this scheme is to provide skill training to the non-literate, neo-literates, persons with rudimentary level of education up-to 8th and school dropouts up to 12th standard in the age group of 14-45 years. The priority groups are women, SC, ST, minority and other backward section of the society. Third-party evaluation study report (year 2020-21) has shown that this scheme is very effective for empowerment of women. The report says “Women representation has been recognized as 79 percent against the male (21 percent). The scheme is women dominated and catering to the mandated target group”.*****
