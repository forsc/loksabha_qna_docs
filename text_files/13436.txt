ANSWER




                                                        (a), (b) and (c): The domestic production of electronic items, including consumer electronics, at this point of time is not sufficient to meet its increasing demand within the country due to several disabilities which render domestic production of electronic items uncompetitive. These, inter-alia, include high cost of finance; logistics;   and lack of electronic components eco-system. The Government has taken several steps to improve the domestic production of electronic items, including consumer electronics as listed at Annexure. As a result, the domestic production of electronic items has increased substantially from Rs.1,90,366 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.4,58,006 crore in 2018-19. The production of consumer electronic items has increased from Rs.55,806 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.77,000 crore in 2018-19. ********AnnexureThe steps taken by the Government to improve the domestic production of electronic items, including consumer electronics1.	National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing, subject to applicable laws/ regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS): The scheme was notified on 27.07.2012 to provide financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector. It has been amended in August, 2015 to extend the period of the scheme, enhance scope of the Scheme by including 15 more product verticals, and attract more investment. The scheme was further amended in January, 2017 to expedite the investments. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The incentives are available for 44 categories/ verticals of electronic products and components covering entire electronics manufacturing value chain.

This fund is expected to foster R&D and innovation in these technology sectors. INR 659 crore has been committed through EDF to 11 Daughter Funds with a targeted corpus of INR 5,500 crore.6.	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile handsets and their parts/ components manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile handsets and their parts/ components has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (SKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition.  7.	Tariff Structure has been rationalized to promote domestic manufacturing of electronic goods, including, inter-alia, Cellular mobile handsets, Televisions, Electronic components, Set Top Boxes for TV, LED products and Medical electronics equipment.8.

Compulsory Registration Order (CRO): MeitY has notified “Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012” for mandatory compliance to ensure safety of Indian citizens by curbing import of substandard and unsafe electronic goods into India. 44 Product Categories have been notified under the CRO.13.	National Centre of Excellence in Large Area Flexible Electronics (NCFLEX) has been set up in IIT-Kanpur with the objectives to promote R&D Manufacturing; Ecosystem; Entrepreneurship; International Partnerships and Human Resources and develop prototypes in collaboration with industry for commercialization. 14.	National Centre of Excellence for Technology on Internal Security (NCETIS) has been set up at IIT-Bombay with the objective to address the internal security needs of the nation on continuous basis by delivering technology prototypes required for internal security and to promote domestic industry in internal security. 15.	National Centre of Excellence for Next Generation AMOLED Displays, OLED Lighting and OPV 2193Products has been set up at IIT-Madras with a mandate to collaborate with stakeholders to develop next-generation, state-of-the-art, high-volume and cost effective electronic components based on organic devices to address requirements through joint technology developments, to realize indigenous technologies for manufacturing. ********
