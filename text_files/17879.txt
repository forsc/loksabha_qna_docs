The rules are presently being finalized.(b):  Section 79(1) of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 grants intermediaries a conditional immunity with regard to any third party content uploaded on their platforms. This immunity is subject to provisions of section 79(2) and 79(3) of the Act.  (c):  Section 79 of the IT Act already provides safe harbor protection to intermediaries subject to their following due diligence as prescribed in Information  Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011 notified under this section. Government respects right of freedom of speech and expression as enshrined in the constitution of India.  The intermediaries are expected to disable any unlawful content relatable to Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency. *******
