ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c) 	The projection of India''s image is one of the fundamental objectives of Indian Missions abroad. In the pursuit to this objective, Indian Missions carry out necessary engagement, partnership and dialogue with the relevant stakeholders to project our achievements in the political, economic, cultural domains as well as make all efforts to present developments within the country in the correct perspective. Some other facets of this engagement include projection of India''s growing international standing, our rich and ancient cultural heritage as well as outreach to seek investment inflows, technology transfer, energy security, etc. to support our steady ascendance as an economic power. The Indian Missions, as part of their cultural outreach have, in recent times, involved the global community in celebration of the International Day of Yoga, held events and activities to mark the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as well as organized seminars, conference and other events to promote our cultural heritage.There is a regular assessment of the efforts of Indian Missions in pursuit of activities for projection of our image abroad which is carried out in a structured manner. An Annual Action Plan is prepared by each Mission listing proposed activities/events and a Publicity Budget is allocated by the Ministry accordingly to organize planned activities/events. As part of this annual exercise, an evaluation is also carried out from time to time to assess the effectiveness of our publicity efforts and to make necessary course corrections as required.***
