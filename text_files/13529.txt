Over the years, the number of loans and the disbursement thereof under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) have increased. In 2018-19, there was a jump by more than 50 % in the number of units supported over 2017-18. Further, the subsidy support has increased from Rs. 1020.06 crore in 2015-16 to Rs.2070.00 crore in 2018-19.

Additionally, 29265 loan proposals have also been approved by Banks. Accordingly, the target to support setting up 78000 new micro enterprises under PMEGP in 2019-20 is likely to be achieved.
