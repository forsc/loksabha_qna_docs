ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-20) has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs.Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of the scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from Jharkhand Skill Development Mission Society (JSDMS), Government of Jharkhand, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 57,668 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 88.79 Cr. for FY 2017-20; out of which, Rs. 29.59 Cr. has been disbursed to State of Jharkhand during FY 2017-18 for the implementation of this component in the State. However, due to slow performance and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalized to Rs. 73.99 crore. (b)	The district-wise number of candidates trained / oriented under PMKVY (2016-20) in State of Jharkhand are given at Annexure.(c) and (d)	Under PMKVY (2016-20), there are various provisions for monitoring of TCs as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrollment-training-assessment-certification-placement) are tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill Development Management System (SDMS) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. Empanelled TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, social media etcAdditionally, PMKVY Monitoring Committees review and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Also, the Committee has formulated penalty grid (approved by Steering Committee for PMKVY) for taking action against erring / non compliant training centres / stakeholders. Based on the penalty grid, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), the implementing agency of PMKVY under MSDE, has suspended training centers for noncompliance of PMKVY 2016-20 guidelines on multiple parameters and periodically publishes the list on PMKVY official website. AnnexureThe district wise no. of candidates trained / oriented under PMKVY (2016-20) in State of Jharkhand, as on 17.01.2020, are given below:S. No.	District	Trained / oriented1.		Bokaro	80902.
