ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNINGAND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	No Sir. While it is desirable that special attention is provided to under-developed blocks, it is for the State Governments to undertake this task. As the template of the on-going Aspirational Districts Programme which involves identification of key performance indicators, robust monitoring of progress and rewarding the districts on basis of performance, has been found effective, the Government of India has encouraged the States to use the same template for identification and rapid development of backward blocks. (b)	As per information made available by the State Governments, Madhya Pradesh, UT of Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana, Tripura, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Nagaland have identified the backward blocks and indicators for monitoring them, based on the template of the Aspirational Districts Programme. As the block-level Programmmes are run by the respective State Governments, the details of the identified blocks and indicators are not available with NITI Aayog. (c)	No Sir. Under the Aspirational Districts Programme, 10 districts of Odisha, namely Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Dhenkanal, Nuapada, Rayagada, Balangir, Gajapati, Kandhamal, Koraput and Nabrangpur are being regularly monitored on 49 Key Performance Indicators across 5 sectors, namely, Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure. As of January 2021, all the 10 Aspirational Districts in Odisha have shown improvement in all sectors since the inception of the Programme. Since performance of a district is reflective of the performance of the blocks that constitute a district, development process in different blocks under Aspirational Districts have accelerated. (d)	As per Schedule 7 of the Constitution of India, development efforts at block level is the responsibility of the State Governments.  Hence, all States including Odisha have been advised to direct the districts to draw block level development plans and implement the same. While this is not collated by the Government of India, States have been conveyed all support in this endeavor by the NITI Aayog.*****
