                                                                                                                    ANSWER                              MINISTER OF STATE FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT                                    (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE) (a) & (b) Department of Land Resources, in consultation with National Informatics Centre (NIC), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Ministry of Science and Technology, has developed a software application known as Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) system for assigning Unique IDs to the land parcels under the broad aegis of the Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) and the same has been circulated to the States/UTs for adoption.         The rolling out of ULPIN depends on willingness of States/UTs as land and its management fall in their domain as per entry number 18 and 45 of the List II (State List) of Schedule VII to the Constitution. Department proposes to facilitate the rollout of ULPIN across the country. (c)     The benefits of ULPIN inter alia include an unique identification number of a land parcel without any duplicity, accuracy in location and area of a land parcel because of its geo-coordinates, reduction in land disputes, facilitation of delivery of citizen centric services that are based on land records, sharing of land records data across Departments, financial institutions and all stakeholders, cross validation of land records data across Departments, standardization at data application level which will  bring effective integration and interoperability across Departments etc. (d)     While pilot testing of ULPIN has been done in Madhya Pradesh, the same is yet to be done in Uttar Pradesh. Government of Madhya Pradesh has issued ULPIN for 103738 land parcels under SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) scheme.                                                    *****
