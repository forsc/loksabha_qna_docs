                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)    The domestic prices of pepper have fallen primarily due to decline in international prices owing to higher production and supply of pepper in the international market and also due to import of pepper from other countries into India. The price of black pepper has been showing declining trend since the year 2017-18. The average price of black pepper during 2017 -18 in domestic market was Rs. 473.73 per kg, which has declined to Rs. 378.21 per kg during 2018-19. (b)     Government is imposing a duty of 70% from 2007 onwards on import of pepper from all countries other than those covered under Trade Agreements and import under Advance Authorization Scheme for value addition and re-export.  In addition, the imposition of Minimum Import Price for black pepper has helped to arrest steep fall of pepper prices and reduce imports. The estimated import of pepper into India in the year 2018-19 was 24950 Metric Tons as compared to 29650 Metric Tons in the year 2017-18, registering a decline of 15.9%.
