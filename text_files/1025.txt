ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The State-wise list of AAI owned non-operational airports/civil enclaves in the country is at Annexure-I.;(c) & (d) Yes, Sir. The AAI has suffered losses on account of maintenance of such non-operational airports during each of the last three years and the current year. The details are at Annexure-II. As there is no revenue in these airports and minimum expense is incurred to maintain the airports which results in loss.;(e): The timeline for construction of airport projects depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatoryclearances, financial closure, etc. by the individual developer, which involve a lengthy and time consuming process.;(f) Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) in 2016 for promotion of Regional Connectivity by way of revival of un-served and under-served airports/airstrips, helipads of the State Governments, AAI, Civil Enclaves and CPSUs through a Budgetary support of Rs.4500 crores. Till date, 39 airports including AAI airports have been operationlised under RCS-UDAN Scheme in the country.
