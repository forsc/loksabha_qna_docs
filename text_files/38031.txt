ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Floodplain zoning has been recognised as an effective non-structural measure for flood management.  Floodplain zoning measures aim at demarcating zones or areas likely to be affected by floods of different magnitude or frequencies and probability levels, and specify the types of permissible developments in these zones, so that whenever flood occur, the damage can be minimized. The action for demarcation of flood plain areas and regulating the activities therein, is to be undertaken by respective State Governments. Government of India has continuously impressed upon the States the need to adopt flood plain zoning approach.  A model draft bill for flood plain zoning legislation was also circulated by the Union Government to all the States in the year 1975.  This bill envisages zoning of flood plain of a river according to flood frequencies and defines the type of use of flood plain.  The States of Manipur, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir have enacted the legislation. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has also time to time advised all Sates in Ganga basin for demarcation, delineation and notification of river flood plains and removal of encroachment from river bed/floodplain of the river Ganga and its tributaries in adherence to the River Ganga [Rejuvenation, Protection and Management] Authorities Order, 2016. (c)  The issue of including “water” in the concurrent list has been discussed at various fora. The proposal to bring ‘water’ in the Union / Concurrent list was examined by the two Commissions on Centre-State Relations chaired by Justice R.S. Sarkaria and Justice M.M. Punchhi respectively. The proposal did not find favour with either of the two Commissions. (d) to (f) Many States have expressed their reservations on implementing floodplain zoning due to reasons like high population density, non availability of sufficient land for relocating the people occupying flood plains, etc.  Government of India has repeatedly advised State/ Union Territories Governments the need for enactment of an appropriate legislation for delineation & demarcation of flood plain zones on the notified stretches of rivers of the State/UT and regulating the activities therein.  The National Water Policy has laid emphasis on conservation of rivers, river corridors, water bodies and building infrastructure in a scientifically planned manner. The policy promotes integrated planning & management of water resources considering challenges of possible climate changes and recognises the need of rehabilitation of natural drainage system, ecological requirement of the river etc. Being a State subject, there is no proposal under consideration of Union Government for providing financial assistance to States for compensating or offering alternative land to those displaced due to enactment of flood plain zoning.  ****
