                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	Agriculture, being a State subject, the State Governments take appropriate measures for development of agriculture in the State. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes/ programmes. The various schemes/ programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. A list of various initiatives taken by the Government are at Annexure. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of the farmers of the country.The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds, and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN. The latest major intervention includes the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture package’ which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of ‘Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crore.Contd….2/--2-(b):	Gross Value Added (GVA) of Agriculture & Allied sectors during 2014-20 is 3.5%.  (c):	The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 containing the strategy for doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. After acceptance of the DFI Committee recommendations, the Government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress.   (d):	The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Apart from demand and supply conditions, quality of produce, weather condition, seasonality, availability of stocks and international prices are also affecting the prices of agricultural produce. Price of agricultural produce tends to fall after harvesting season due to increase in market arrival of new crops.(e):	The Government has taken a number of steps to improve post harvest infrastructure such as cold storages, warehouses, efficient supply chains etc. under various schemes such as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana  - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation (RKVY - RAFTAAR), Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure and Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY). Further, in order to prevent farmers from distress sales a 2% interest subvention has been extended to small and marginal formers having KCC on post harvest loans against negotiable warehouses receipts (NWRs) at the same rate as applicable to crop loans for a period upto 6 months post harvest.
