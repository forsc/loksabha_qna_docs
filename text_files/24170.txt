In pursuance of the Amendments to Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) by Companies (Amendment) Act, 2019 and Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020, the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 have been amended on 22nd January 2021. These amendments aim at strengthening the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ecosystem by improving the disclosures, simplifying the compliances, bringing in more objectivity and transparency, and entrusting more responsibility on the Board of the company. These amendments, inter-alia, include mandatory registration of implementing agencies with the Ministry, flexibility to board for spending as per project requirements, treatment of unspent amount as well as set-off of excess amount spent under CSR, impact assessment of CSR projects, modalities for creation and acquisition of capital assets through CSR etc.(e): As per the Companies Act, 2013 companies are required to hold Annual General Meeting (AGM) within six months from the end of financial year. Thereafter, financial statements and board report containing disclosure about CSR, are to be filed in MCA21 within 30 days of the AGM. Thus, the CSR data for the Financial Year 2020-21 is not available. ******
