Accordingly, these cases were referred to the concerned State Governments and UT Administrations for taking necessary action. As per Action Taken Reports (ATRs) received from States and UTs, action such as issuing warning against the official responsible, terminating the contract of concerned NGOs / Organisations, initiating criminal proceedings and imposing penalties against the defaulting persons/officials/organisations have been taken by the concerned State Governments and UT Administrations. The details of action taken on these complaints are given at Annexure.
