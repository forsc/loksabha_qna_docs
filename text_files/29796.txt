ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) The Government has been implementing  the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) w.e.f  2018-19  with the primary aim of strengthening governance capabilities of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to deliver on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).	The Scheme envisages enhancing the capacities of Panchayats through a concerted, capacity building process and expansion of outreach and coverage of training. It aims to strengthen Gram Sabhas to function effectively as the basic forum of people’s participation with focus on vulnerable groups. RGSA has programmatic focus on ensuring basic orientation training for the Elected Representatives (ERs) of Panchayats within 6 months of their election, and refresher trainings within two years. It lays greater thrust for e-enablement of Panchayats, for e-governance to enhance efficiency and transparency.The Government has not proposed to organize any special training programme for imparting training to the public representatives in municipal bodies with respect to their rights, duties and powers. However, under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT), 56310 functionaries and elected representatives have been trained so far. Segregated information of functionaries & elected representatives is not maintained by the Government.(c) Does not arise. ***
