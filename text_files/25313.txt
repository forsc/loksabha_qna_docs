ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Skill India Mission was launched with aim to converge all skilling efforts across sectors and States. To realize the aim of the Mission and to bring standardization and uniformity in competency-based skill training, MSDE has taken several steps for convergence of all skill schemes/programmes at the centre and state level. Under this initiative, convergence has also been done through linkages of PMKVY with NAPS, JSS and ITI-based training.(b)       Convergence between various MSDE schemes including PMKVY, NAPS and JSS has been achieved through following:•	Standardization and alignment of curriculum and content through the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF)•	Data Convergence of various skill schemes through the Skill India Portal•	Unified regulation through the National Council for Vocational Education & Training (NCVET)•	Standardization of inputs of training including Trainers and Training Providers (through the SMART and TAKSHASHILA portals)•	For leveraging ITI infrastructure, training under PMKVY 3.0 is also taking place in ITIs•	In terms of learning pathways, PMKVY-certified candidates are eligible to pursue apprenticeship training. JSS certification is mostly leading to NSQF Level 1 and Level 2 certification and such candidates can thereafter pursue modular courses offered under PMKVY. The credit framework for seamless movement between short duration training and long duration training at ITIs is also being developed.(c)        Yes Sir, Ministry has undertaken third party evaluation of PMKVY2.0. (d)       As per the Third Party Evaluation of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), it was found that average monthly income of PMKVY trained and certified individuals was 15% higher than the comparison group. Also, a significant 19% difference in average monthly income was observed with respondents who had undertaken RPL versus those who had not over a period of time. Moreover, 76% of the candidates acknowledged that after the training, they have better chance of getting employment.
