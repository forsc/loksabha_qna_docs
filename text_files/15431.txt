                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4107 BY SHRI GOPAL JEE THAKUR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2020 REGARDING RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN DARBHANGA AND MUZAFFARPUR(a) to (f): Darbhanga-Muzaffarpur (67 Km) new line has been sanctioned. Latest anticipated cost of this project is ?870 crore. Final Location Survey has been taken up. Execution of a Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site, due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project.To ensure that project is completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides, to ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts, which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. Further, for capacity enhancement projects institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.…..2/--2-Budget Allocation (for projects falling full/partly in the State of Bihar):•	Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/ partly in the State of Bihar, during 2014-19 has increased to ?3,061 crore per year  from ?1,132 crore per year (during 2009-14), which is 170% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. •	Total allocation of Budget for infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/ partly in the State of Bihar, in 2019-20 is ?4,093 crore, which is 262 % more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.Commissioning of Projects (falling full/partly in the  State of Bihar):•	During 2009-14, 318 Km (150 Km of new line, 160 km of Gauge conversion and 8 km of Doubling) projects, falling fully/ partly in the State of Bihar, have been commissioned in the State at an average rate of 64 km per year.•	During 2014-19, 695 Km (240 km of new line, 280 Km Gauge conversion and 175 Km of Doubling) projects, falling fully/ partly in the State of Bihar, have been commissioned in the State at an average rate of 139 km per year which is 118% more than the commissioning during 2009-14.*****
