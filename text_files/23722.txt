ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b):  The Government is implementing the e-Courts Mission Mode Project for Information and Communication Technology enablement of district and subordinate courts across the country in association with the eCommittee of Supreme Court of India.  The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase-I was implemented during 2011- 2015 with a total expenditure of Rs. 639.41 crore.   The eCourts Mission Mode Project Phase-II has commenced since 2015 for a period of four years (2015-19) or until the project is completed, whichever is later. So far 18,735 District and Subordinate Courts have been computerized. Out of 2992 court complexes Wide Area Network connectivity has been provided to 2940 court complexes. Against the financial outlay of Rs.1670 crores for eCourts Phase-II, the Government has so far released a sum of Rs. 1548.13 crore for implementation of the eCourt project.  Some of the other salient achievements under eCourts Project Phase II include the introduction of Case Information Software using Free and Open Source Software to automate the entire process of Court registry. This has led to the ‘National Judicial Data Grid’ (NJDG), which provides status of 18.28 crore pending/disposed cases and 13.88 crore orders/judgments of Subordinate Courts and High Courts (as on 3rd March 2021). Open Application Programming Interface (APIs) has been recently introduced to allow Central and State Governments and institutional litigants to access NJDG data for pendency monitoring.  Seven platforms have been created for disseminating real time information on case status, cause list, judgements etc. to lawyers and litigants viz. a multilingual and disabled-friendly eCourts Portal, eCourts Mobile App and JustIS App for judges, Automated emails, SMS Push and Pull Service, Judicial Service Centers and Information Kiosks.The Supreme Court of India emerged as a global leader with more than 59,309 virtual hearings (as on 15th February 2021). The High Courts (27,58,560 hearings) and Subordinate Courts (54,46,876 hearings) have conducted more than 82.05 lakh virtual hearings till 28th February 2021.  Funds for 2506 VC cabins and VC equipment for 14,443 court rooms have also been released.  In a first of its kind, 11 Virtual courts have been set up in 9 States which tried 55.44 lakh traffic offences including online realization of Rs. 150 crore as fines.  Expanding the scope of Virtual Courts, Delhi High Court has recently started 34 Digital Courts to deal exclusively with cheque bounce cases under Section 138 NI Act. eFiling system has been rolled out for the electronic filing of legal papers. For making the payment process easy and transparent, online payment of court fees, fines, penalties and judicial deposits has been enabled. Electronic processing and serving of summons has been introduced through National Service and Tracking of Electronic Processes (NSTEP). To mitigate the handicaps caused by digital divide, 235 e-SewaKendras or e-Resource Centre have also been funded.-----
