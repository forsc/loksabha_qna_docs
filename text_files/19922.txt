(SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (d):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 112   DUE FOR REPLY ON 9TH FEBRUARY, 2021.(a) to (d):	One representation has been received from Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) with the request therein to provide generic fertilizers, manure, pesticides, seeds etc. to fertilisers at cheaper prices. In this connection, details of the existing position and action being taken are as under:-(i)	PesticidesIn the present Insecticides Act, 1968 and the Rules 1971, the term generic pesticides does not exist. However, the registration under section 9(4) are considered as repeat registrations of already registered pesticides in the country. The Repeat registrations are being granted on simplified requirements and on same conditions as has been granted to the original registrant. This provision enables the competition among the manufacturers and importers and thereby reducing the prices of pesticides as agriculture input for the farmers.However, in the Pesticide Management Bill 2020, introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 23.03.2020, specific provision for generic pesticides has been provided. (ii)	Fertilizers and ManureFertilisers have been specified under Fertiliser (Control) Order, 1985 (FCO) as per their general chemical name or as per their grades or by their general name. All the manufacturers are required to produce fertilisers as per their general specifications prescribed in FCO only.  Hence, fertilisers are not notified under their brand name in FCO. It is the endeavour of the Government to provide good quality fertilisers at the reasonable price. To achieve this objective, subsidy is being provided on Urea and 22 grades of  P&K fertilizers. Contd…2/- -2-(iii)	 SeedsSub Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP) is being implemented from the year 2014-15 to promote production of quality seeds of agriculture crops so that the required quantity of seeds could be made available to the farmers in the country. The financial assistance is available/provided for different seed related activities through schemes/components of SMSP for the welfare of farmers in the country. Assistance for quality seed production and procurement is also provided under schemes of National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Paramparaghat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) etc.*******
