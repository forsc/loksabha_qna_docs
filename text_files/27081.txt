ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya M&46; Scindia)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 248 REGARDING "SETTING UP OF FLYING TRAINING INSTITUTES" TO BE ANSWERED ON 05.08.2021  (a) Yes, Sir. The Government has taken several steps for advancement of flying training in the country, which include the following:; i. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has come up with a liberalised Flying Training Organisations (FTO) policy wherein the concept of airport royalty (revenue share payment by FTOs to AAI) has been abolished and land rentals have been significantly rationalised.  Under this policy, eight new FTOs are likely to be established at five AAI airports - Belagavi (Karnataka), Jalgaon (Maharashtra), Kalaburgi (Karnataka), Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh) and Lilabari (Assam).  Agreements between AAI and the winning bidders have been signed.  ii. DGCA is planning to increase the frequency of examinations of flying cadets with a view to reduce the lead time for obtaining the Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL).; iii. DGCA has modified its regulations to empower Flying Instructors with the right to authorise flight operations at FTOs. This may help increase the flying hours and aircraft utilisation at each FTO; and lead to faster completion of the CPL requirements.  iv. India''s largest flying academy - Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA) at Amethi (Uttar Pradesh) - has been permitted to carry out pilot training in Gondia (Maharashtra) and Kalaburagi (Karnataka) to enhance its flying hours and aircraft utilisation, which get severely affected during winter months due to visibility issues.; v.  IGRUA has been directed to operate on all weekends and holidays in order to enhance its flying hours. Other private FTOs are also being encouraged to do so. ;;  (b) The number of commercial pilots who have completed flying training in India during the last three years are as under:         Year 		   Number of pilots         2018             415         2019             430         2020             335; (c) Flying training institutes can be established as per the guidelines laid down under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section 7, Series D, Part I issued by DGCA. Any State Government or private entity may apply to DGCA for setting up of an FTO.   (d) and (e)  The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in job losses in the aviation sector across the world, including in India.  According to information received from airlines in India, while they have undertaken several measures to rationalise their cost-structure, so far, no person employed by them in the pilot category has had his/her services discontinued due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
