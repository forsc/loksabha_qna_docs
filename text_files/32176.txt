                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c) Sandila industrial area is located in the catchment of river Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga which confluences with river Ganga at Gomti Sagar Ghat in Nakhwan village of Varanasi. Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has identified three industries operating in Sandila industrial areas as Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) having potential to generate pollution load of 100 kg/day or more and/or toxic effluents and the same were inspected by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) during 2020-21 and all were found to be complying with effluent discharge norms.  In addition to above, there are 6 Red category industries and 98 Orange/Green category industries in Industrial area Sandila, Hardoi.  All the industries are provided with proper Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP).CPCB is carrying out fortnightly monitoring for assessment of River Ganga water quality at 2 locations namely (i) Varanasi - Malviya Bridge (before confluence with River Gomti) and (ii) Gomti River - Bhusaula (after confluence with River Gomti) through UPPCB. River water quality for the present year (January-August 2021) is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing at both the monitoring locations in terms of pH and DO. CPCB organizes annual inspection of 100% GPIs. Since 2017, four rounds of inspection have been completed in 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020 and fifth round is under progress. *****
