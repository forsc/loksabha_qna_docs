                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????        (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b) The Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a polyphagous migratory pest species in the order of Lepidoptera. The pest was reported for the first time in India in May 2018. The Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestation in maize has been reported from Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Karnataka, Telengana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Jammu & Kashmir & Uttarakhand during the years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (up to Kharif 2021).(c) Government of India is promoting use of bio-pesticides in Agriculture. The Registration Committee (RC) has formulated simplified guidelines for registration of bio-pesticides as compared to chemical pesticides. Provisional registration for bio-pesticides is being granted under Section 9(3b) of the Insecticides Act. The applicant is allowed to commercialize the bio-pesticide product during the provisional registration.            Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is being implemented through training and demonstration in crops, inter-alia promotion of biological control approaches in crop protection technology. The 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centers (CIPMCs) in different States and UTs popularize the IPM through Farmer Field Schools and HRD programs. CIPMCs conduct workshops, group meetings, trainings, various HRD programs and activities to promote the use of bio-control agents, bio-pesticides among the farming community. Bio-control agents are mass multiplied in laboratories and released in farmer’s fields, which reduce pest infestation and thus avoid crop loss. Farmers are also trained in farm production of bio-control agents, Entomo-pathogens and antagonistic fungi & bacteria to reduce the dependency on chemical pesticides. Further, farmers are made aware about conservation of natural enemies and mass multiplied bio-control agents are released in farmer fields for holistic management of pest & diseases.	Package of Practices (POP), posters related to preliminary identification at farm level, folders, informative bulletins on fall armyworm and control measures to be taken up were prepared and supplied to stakeholders in different regional languages.(d) Does not arise. *****
