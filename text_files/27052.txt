ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a): Details of number of posts of judges lying vacant at present and time since when they are lying vacant  in respect of District Courts of Andhra Pradesh as provided by the  High Court of Andhra Pradesh is enclosed at Annexure-I.(b):	Details of number of cases pending District-wise during the last five years, year- wise as provided by High Court of Andhra Pradesh is enclosed at Annexure-II.  Time taken for disposal of a case depends on several factors such as category of case (civil or criminal), complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stakeholders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants besides the availability of physical infrastructure, supporting court staff and applicable rules of procedure.  There are several factors which may lead to delay in disposal of cases.  These, inter-alia, include vacancies of judges, frequent adjournments, lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing etc.  (c) & (d): 	Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court. Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issue of appointment, promotion, reservations and retirement of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. The Union Government does not have a role under the Constitution in the selection and appointment of judicial officers in District/ subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court, in its orders of 04th January, 2007 in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary which stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions. 	Further, in compliance of the above directions of the Supreme Court, Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the Malik Mazhar judgement to Registrars General of all High Courts for necessary action. Department of Justice is writing from time to time to Registrars General of all High Courts to expedite the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary mandated by Malik Mazhar case. In September, 2016, Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to the Chief Ministers of States and the Chief Justices of High Courts to enhance the cadre strength of the District and Subordinate Courts and provide physical infrastructure to the State judiciary. The same was reiterated in May, 2017.  In August, 2018, in the context of increasing pendency of cases, the Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts including High Court of Andhra Pradesh to monitor the status of the vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with the State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts as per time schedule prescribed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Malik Mazhar Sultan case. The filling up of vacancies is also being monitored by the Supreme Court in a suo-motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 2 of 2018.**** Annexure-ISTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO  PART (A)  OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2562 FOR ANSWER ON 04.08.2021 REGARDING  POST OF JUDGES LYING VACANTSl No.	Name  of the District	Sanctioned Strength	Working Strength	Vacancy	Date from when Vacant1	Anantapur	8	7	1	Chairman Industrial Tribunal –cum- POLC, Ananthapuramu from 26.03.20202	Chittoor	13	9	4	VI ADJ, Chittoor from July, 2021POSCO Court, from 01.01.2021X ADJ, Tirupati, from July, 2021VII ADJ, Madanapalli, from 01.09.20203	Cuddapah	8	6	2	I ADJ, Kadapa,  from 02.07.2020VII ADJ (Women) Court, Kadapa,- Date Nil-4	East Godavari	13	7	6	POSCO Court, Kakinada, from February, 2021Special Judge for SCs and STs Act, Rajamahendravaramfrom July, 2021Judge, Family Court, Rajamahendravaram from July, 2021V ADJ, Rajamahendravaram from 01.01.2020 VIII ADJ, Rajamahendravaram, from 01.07.2021VI ADJ, Kakinada, from 01.06.20215	Guntur	12	7	5	III ADJ, Guntur, from 26.08.2020Judge, Family Court, Guntur, from July, 2021POSCO Court, Guntur, from 02.10.2019X ADJ, Gurazala, from 12.09.2019V ADJ, Guntur, from July, 20216	 Krishna	21	11	10	I ADJ, Machilipatnam,  from June 2020VI ADJ, Machilipatnam,   from 01.08.2020SPE and ACB Court, Vijayawada, from February, 2021XIV ADJ,  Vijayawada,   from 10.07.2020Co-Operative Tribunal, Vijayawada from 01.02.2018POSCO Court,  Vijayawada, from 02.10.2019VII ADJ, Vijayawada,  from June 2020Special Court for Trial of Criminal Cases relating to elected MPs and MLAs, Vijayawada from 07.03.2018Special Court for Protection of depositors of financial establishment Act, 1999, Vijayawada from 15.12.2016XVI ADJ, Nandigama, from July, 20217	Kurnool	9	7	2	I ADJ, Kurnool,  from July, 2021VII ADJ (Women) Court, Kurnool - Date Nil-8	Nellore	10	8	2	VII ADJ (Women) Court, Nellore, from July, 2021POSCO Court, Nellore,  from 02.10.20199	Prakasam	7	4	3	Family Court, Ongole  from July, 2021II ADJ, Ongole  from 19.09.2019POSCO Court, Ongole,   from 02.10.2019 10	Srikakulam	7	4	3	I ADJ, Srikakulam  from 24.06.2020Special Court for SCs and STs Act, Srikakulam,  from 01.03.2021  V ADJ, Lakshmipeta  from 01.02.201411	Visakhapatnam	21	14	7	III ADJ, Visakhapatnam 08.07.2020Family Court  from 31.08.2020I and III Addl.
