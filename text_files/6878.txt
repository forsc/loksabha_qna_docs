                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) of LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *43 FOR ANSWER ON 20TH NOVEMBER, 2019.(a) and (b): As per information available on the National Judicial Data Grid (as on 14th November, 2019), there are 75,01,283 cases pending in the District and Subordinate Courts of Uttar Pradesh. The district-wise number of cases pending in the State of Uttar Pradesh is given in the Annexure.As regards reasons for pendency of cases in courts, it is stated that timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing. (c): It is the primary responsibility of the State Governments to provide Judicial Infrastructure / Court Rooms for High Courts and District / Subordinate Courts. To supplement these efforts, the Union Government is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern between Centre and States.  The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94.  It covers the construction of court halls and court complexes and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. In the case of Uttar Pradesh, a sum of Rs. 1101.60 crore has been sanctioned till 15/11/19 since the inception of the Scheme, out of which Rs. 550.31 crore has been sanctioned since 2014-15 (which is around 50% of the total release under the Scheme). During the current financial year 2019-20, a sum of Rs. 121.94 crore has been sanctioned to the State of Uttar Pradesh. Under this scheme, in the State of Uttar Pradesh, 2278 court halls and 1937 residential units have been made available for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts as on 15/11/19 against the working strength of 2012 Judicial Officers. In addition, 332 court halls and 401 residential units are under construction in Uttar Pradesh. In respect of all States / UTs, a sum of Rs. 7453.10 crore has been sanctioned till 15/11/19 since the inception of the Scheme, out of which Rs. 4008.80 crore has been sanctioned since 2014-15 (which is around 54% of the total release under the Scheme). During the current financial year 2019-20, a sum of Rs. 702.86 crore, out of the allocated budget of Rs. 710.00 crore, has already been sanctioned to States/UTs. Under this scheme, 19,414 court halls and 17,103 residential units have been made available for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts as on 15/11/19 against the working strength of 17,342 Judicial Officers. In addition, 2,822 court halls and 1,869 residential units are under construction.(d) The Government is committed to speedy disposal of cases and reduction in pendency of cases to improve access to justice in line with the mandate under Article 39A of the Constitution. The Union Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms established in 2011 by the Government has adopted a coordinated approach to effect for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency at various levels of judicial administration through many strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure [court halls and residential units] for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court, reduction in pendency through follow up by Arrears Committees at District, High Court and Supreme Court level, emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) and initiatives to fast track special type of cases. In addition, all stakeholders including Judicial Officers can access information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of computerized District & Subordinate Courts and High Courts on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). 	Currently litigants can access case status information in respect of over 12.23 crore pending and disposed cases and more than 10.26 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts from NJDG. Also, Pending cases are considered and disposed in Lok Adalats conducted under National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). 172.60 lakh pending cases have been settled in National Lok Adalat from 2015 till date while 88.40 lakh pending cases have been settled in Regular Lok Adalats during 2015-16 to June, 2019. 	(e): The High Court Benches are established in accordance with the recommendations made by the Jaswant Singh Commission and judgment pronounced by the Apex Court in W.P.(C) No.379 of 2000 and after receipt and due consideration of a complete proposal from the State Government, which incorporates readiness to provide infrastructure and meet the related expenditure, along with the consent of the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court who is responsible for day to day administration of the High Court and its Bench. The proposal should also have the consent of the Governor of the concerned State. No proposal (complete in all respects) has been received from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh to establish a Bench of Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh. ************ AnnexureStatement referred to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *43 for reply on 20th November, 2019District-wise number of cases pending in the State of Uttar PradeshS.
