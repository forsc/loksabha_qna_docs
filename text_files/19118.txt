ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (e) There are two types of rivers in the country; (i) perennial rivers and (ii) non-perennial rivers. In perennial rivers, water remains available throughout the year while non-perennial rivers are rain fed rivers in which water flows only during the rainfall period. The flow in the rivers is dynamic and depends on many parameters such as rainfall, its distribution pattern and intensity in the catchment, catchment characteristics and quantum of withdrawals / utilizations of water. Central Water Commission (CWC) carries out hydrological exercise on all important / major rivers in the country. As per information available in CWC based on annual average flows of last 20 years of terminal sites of major rivers, no increasing/decreasing trend in water availability was observed in the major rivers in the country. Government of India vide Gazette Notification dated 9th October, 2018 has notified the minimum environmental flows for river Ganga that has to be maintained at various locations on the river. The order applies to the Upper Ganga River Basin starting from originating glaciers and through respective confluences of its head tributaries finally meeting at Devprayag up to Haridwar and the main stem of river Ganga up to Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. Monitoring of e-flows is being carried by CWC since January, 2019.  While water quality in some rivers has improved, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 351 polluted stretches in the year 2018 based upon the water quality criteria of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), a key indicator of pollution.Contd…P/2//2//Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is a continuous process and Central Government is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of river rejuvenation through programmes like Namami Gange and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP). NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5965.90 crore & sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created.  Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 333 projects has been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.29,571 crore so far, of which 140 projects have been completed and made operational.  Out of 333 projects, 154 projects are in the sewerage sectors for creation of new sewage treatment capacity of 3785 mld, rehabilitation of 1081 mld treatment capacity and sewerage network of 5066 kms.  Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during the last three years and current year under NRCP (excluding river Ganga and its tributaries) and Namami Gange programmes is given in Annexure.In addition, sewerage infrastructure is also being created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.	Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of effluents into rivers inter alia, include issuance of notification of specific discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing directions to all State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/ consent to operate by the SPCBs/ PCCs, regular inspections of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) by CPCB for compliance verification, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status.  In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their wastewater generation by technological advancement, reuse/ recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible. Further, CPCB, SPCBs and PCCs monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.Hon’ble NGT has passed orders in OA No.673/2018 and directed all the concerned State Governments and UT Administrations to prepare Action Plans and ensure execution of approved Action Plans within a stipulated time period for bringing all the polluted river stretches identified by CPCB to be fit at least for bathing purposes. All the concerned 28 States and 3 UTs are implementing the approved Action Plans for rejuvenation of the identified polluted river stretches in their respective States/UTs. The Hon’ble NGT has also issued directions, amongst others, for ensuring the maintenance of the water quality and e-flows in the rivers vide orders/ judgments in OA No 200 of 2014. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 492 to be answered on 04.02.2021 regarding Water Level in Rivers Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during last three years and current year under NRCP (excluding river Ganga and its tributaries)                                                                                                                                        (Rs. in Crore)Sl.
