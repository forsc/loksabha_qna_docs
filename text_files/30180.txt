                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a): The Ministry of Civil Aviation had filed a combined Counter Affidavit dated 13.07.2021 in the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in Writ Petitions No. 7572 of 2021, No. 8960/2021 and No. 8961/2021 inter-alia informing the Hon''ble Court that approval of the Union Cabinet is required for declaring an airport as an International Airport. Hon''ble Court vide Order dated 14.07.2021 had disposed of the said court cases without passing any particular directions.;(b): No, Sir.;(c): Declaration  of an airport as International Airport depends  upon traffic potential  and  demand from  airlines  for operation  of international flights, besides various other infrastructural requirements. Madurai airport is a Customs airport and all the designated Indian carriers are free to mount operations from Madurai to foreign destinations under the ambit of bilateral Air Service Agreements (ASA) concluded by India with foreign countries as per mutually agreed capacity limits. With respect to foreign airlines, operations are governed by bilateral ASAs between India and the country of the foreign airline concerned. Any foreign airline can operate from a point in India if it is designated as a point of call in the ASA.;
