                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b):Yes Sir. In accordance with provisions under the Statutes of National Institutes of Technology (NITs), the existing faculty members who have completed their Ph.D. alongwith their normal teaching responsibilities in the Institute or under quality improvement programme are eligible to apply against vacant regular post of Assistant Professor in NITs. As per clause (3) of Schedule ‘E’ referred in Statute 23 (5) (a) of the Statutes of NITs, the enrolment period of Ph.D. in respect of such faculties is counted as teaching experience.(c) to (e):No Sir. Candidates who are already members of the faculty, either regular or on contract, and are pursuing a higher degree in the Institute are eligible to be considered for recruitment, if otherwise qualified as per the qualifications and other terms and conditions of appointment specified in Statutes. There is no cooling-off period required for existing members of faculty. The guidelines framed under Section 32 (2) (b) of the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research Act, 2007 and Statute 23 (3) of the Statutes states that:-“Most leading universities of the world, including the best Institutes of India have an explicit or implicit policy of not inducting their own students into the faculty. To avoid such in-breeding, the NITs & IIEST will follow the following policies:(i)Candidates who have obtained or are expected to obtain their most recent degree (Ph.D.) from the Institute will normally not be considered for recruitment, except where there is a 3 years’ gap (approximately) between leaving the Institute and the expected date of joining.(ii)This is not applicable to candidates who are already members of the faculty, either regular or on contract, and are pursuing a higher degree in the Institute.”………….*-*-*-*-*
