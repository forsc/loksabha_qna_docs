ANSWER




(a)  	Yes Sir, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Government of India launched the PradhanMantriBhartiyaJanaushadhiPariyojana (PMBJP) with an objective of making quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all. Under this scheme, dedicated outlets known as PradhanMantriBhartiyaJanaushadhiKendras are opened to provide generic medicines. As on 29.01.2020, 6072 PMBJP Kendras are opened in the country. PMBJP has covered 696 districts out of 728 districts of the country. Total sales in the financial year 2018-19 was Rs 315.70 Crore which led to total savings of approximately Rs 2000 Crore of common citizens. (b) Yes Sir. (c) The medicines sold under this scheme are procured only from World Health Organization – Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP) certified suppliers for ensuring the quality of the products. Apart from this, each batch of drug is tested at a laboratory accredited by ‘National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories’ (NABL). The medicines are dispatched to PMBJP Kendras only after quality tests are passed.(d)  As on 29.01.2020, 6072 PMBJP Kendras are opened in the country. State-wise list of PMBJP Kendras, functional across the country is enclosed as Annexure.(e) A medicine under PMBJP is priced on the principle of a maximum of 50% of the average price of top three branded medicines. Therefore, the price of a Jan Aushadhi Medicine is cheaper at least by 50% and in some cases, by 90% of the market price of branded medicines. (f) In the financial year 2017-18, the target was to increase the number of PMBJP Kendras to 3000, which was achieved in December 2017. Similarly, the target to increase the number of Kendras to 5000 in financial year 2018-19 was also achieved in February, 2019.  (g) Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (PMBJP)- the implementing agency for the Scheme- procures medicines only from World Health Organization – Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP) certified domestic suppliers for ensuring the quality of the products. Presently, there are more than 150 WHO-GMP certified pharmaceutical companies as its regular vendors. All medicines are manufactured in India. Thus, PMBJP promotes the use of domestically manufactured drugs and medicines.
