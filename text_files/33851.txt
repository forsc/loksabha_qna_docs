SHRI SANJAY KAKA PATIL:	SHRI POCHA BRAHMANANDA REDDY:Will the Minister of ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY be pleased to state:(a)	whether the government is on the track to achieve the target of local electronic manufacturing of $250-$300 billion by 2026;(b)	if so, the details and year-wise projections thereof; and(c)	if not, the details of the challenges being faced by the Government in achieving the target? ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAJEEV CHANDRASEKHAR)(a) and (b): Yes, Sir.  Government is on track to achieve the target of domestic electronic manufacturing of $300 Billion by 2026.  The goal of Government of India is to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub in global value chains for Electronics as part of its AtmaNirbhar Bharat economic policies and to further capitalize on the growing demand by the world’s consuming economies for trusted value chain. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) working together with industry (Indian Cellular and Electronics Association) has finalised  and  released a vision document aiming for $300 billion sustainable electronics manufacturing by 2026.  The strategy to reach the $300 billion production of electronics from current level of about $75 billion is built on broadening and deepening electronics manufacturing in India. This is proposed to be achieved by building competitiveness and scale by attracting global electronics manufacturers/brands, shifting, and developing sub-assemblies and component ecosystem, building a design ecosystem, nurturing Indian champions, and steadily removing cost disabilities faced by the industry. Flagship schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes, Schemes for Promotion of Electronics Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Schemeand Programme for development of semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem in India are expected to propel electronics manufacturing in India. The steps taken by the Government for the expansion of electronic manufacturing in the country are at Annexure. The year wise projections for achieving the target of domestic electronics manufacturing of$300 billion by FY 2025-26 is as under:Year	2020-21	2021-22	2022-23	2023-24	2024-25	2025-26Value (USD Billion)	74.7	82	110	155	220	300Source: Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA)********Annexure Steps taken by the Government for the expansion of electronics manufacturing in the country:1.	National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing (except from countries sharing land border with India), subject to applicable laws / regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme: Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme was notified on 22nd October, 2012 to provide support for creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investment. Under the Scheme, 19 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) measuring an area of 3,464 acres with total project cost of INR 3,762 crore including Government Grant-in-Aid of INR 1,538 crore have been approved.4.	Electronics Development Fund (EDF): Electronics Development Fund (EDF) has been set up as a “Fund of Funds” to participate in professionally managed “Daughter Funds” which in turn will provide risk capital to startups and companies developing new technologies in the area of electronics and Information Technology (IT). This fund is expected to foster R&D and innovation in these technology sectors.5.	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile phones and their sub-assemblies / parts manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile phones has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (CKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition. 6.	Tariff Structure has been rationalized to promote domestic manufacturing of electronic goods, including, inter-alia, Cellular mobile phones, Televisions, Electronic components, Set Top Boxes for TV, LED products and Medical electronics equipment.7.	Exemption from Basic Customs Duty on capital goods: Notified capital goods for manufacture of specified electronic goods are permitted for import at “NIL” Basic Customs Duty.8.	Simplified import of used plant and machinery: The import of used plant and machinery having a residual life of at least 5 years for use by the electronics manufacturing industry has been simplified through the amendment of Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, vide Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Notification dated 11.06.2018.9.	Relaxing the ageing restriction: The Department of Revenue vide Notification No.60/2018-Customs dated 11.09.2018 has amended the Notification No.158/95-Customs dated 14.11.1995, relaxing the ageing restriction from 3 years to 7 years for specified electronic goods manufactured in India and re-imported into India for repairs or reconditioning.10.
