It is mentioned that to make the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 more effective and to provide greater justice and enhanced redress to injustice suffered by the atrocity victims, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (PoA) Act, 1989, has been amended vide the SC/ST (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015 (No. 1 of 2016). The recent amendment include new offences, expanded scope of presumptions, institutional strengthening, which inter-alia includes establishment of Exclusive Special Courts and specification of Exclusive Special Public Prosecutors to exclusively try the offences under the PoA Act to enable expeditious disposal of  cases, power of Special Courts and Exclusive Special Courts to take direct cognizance of offences and as far as possible, completion of trial within two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet, establishing rights of victims and witnesses, and strengthening preventive measures. Further, Section 18 of the PoA Act was amended through the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2018 (No. 27 of 2018) and enforced on 20.08.2018, and now conduct of a preliminary enquiry before registration of an FIR, or to seek approval of any authority prior to arrest of an accused, is no longer required.‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects and the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is implemented by the respective State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. The Government reviews with the law implementing agencies of the State Government for ensuring prompt registering of atrocities, speedy investigation of the offences and timely disposal of cases by the Courts.      Further, Government of India has issued advisories to the State Governments/UT Administrations from time to time for effective implementation of the PoA Act and Rules.***** Annexure  LSUQ No. 4152 for 29.03.2022State/UT-wise Cases Registered(CR), Cases Chargesheeted (CCS), Cases Convicted(CON), Cases Pending Trial at the end of the year (CPTEY) under Total of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (with & without IPC) for Crime/Atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes during 2018-2020SL	State/UT	2018	2019	2020		CR	CCS	CON	CPTEY	CR	CCS	CON	CPTEY	CR	CCS	CON	CPTEY1	Andhra Pradesh	2159	1681	58	3714	2401	1121	40	4043	2268	1847	38	52832	Arunachal Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	23	Assam	14	3	0	10	25	6	0	15	38	3	0	154	Bihar	7125	6544	44	39063	6641	4869	46	43494	7462	5528	12	488825	Chhattisgarh	652	613	91	1115	768	700	86	1259	818	742	70	14556	Goa	10	6	2	23	5	5	0	22	4	3	0	227	Gujarat	1737	1541	15	9151	1737	1518	12	9962	1617	1456	4	110718	Haryana	961	564	54	1134	1087	671	64	1517	1210	632	6	21019	Himachal Pradesh	128	110	2	393	186	108	6	432	250	184	1	58510	Jharkhand	760	334	32	1681	988	449	27	1785	1013	378	22	201911	Karnataka	1643	1377	47	7962	1827	1376	29	8335	1685	1466	18	908612	Kerala	1025	783	28	2666	998	728	16	3089	976	764	14	357313	Madhya Pradesh	6621	6600	1041	19559	7222	6918	1378	22051	9300	9080	689	2652214	Maharashtra	2500	1958	102	8924	2708	2247	105	9684	3232	2765	51	1131715	Manipur	1	0	0	3	2	0	0	3	2	0	0	316	Meghalaya	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	017	Mizoram	0	0	0	0	8	8	0	0	0	0	0	018	Nagaland	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	019	Odisha	2335	2360	11	10070	2462	3047	2	12370	2670	2663	5	1432720	Punjab	168	84	6	173	167	76	5	213	169	98	4	28521	Rajasthan	5702	3004	712	13571	8591	4026	1121	15078	8895	4246	686	1706022	Sikkim	6	5	1	6	6	4	1	8	0	0	0	623	Tamil Nadu	1422	1229	99	4709	1175	992	95	4885	1296	982	129	530824	Telangana	1926	1343	37	2935	2220	1539	74	3673	2532	1941	15	471725	Tripura	1	0	0	1	2	2	0	1	4	0	0	126	Uttar Pradesh	11841	9782	1539	47047	11865	9982	1620	50068	12717	10492	1821	5798027	Uttarakhand	65	70	1	204	92	75	18	245	100	75	2	31028	West Bengal	220	140	1	532	244	138	0	600	199	197	0	723 	TOTAL STATE(S)	49022	40131	3923	174646	53427	40606	4745	192833	58457	45543	3587	22265329	A&N Islands	1	1	0	2	3	0	0	1	2	3	0	030	Chandigarh	1	1	0	4	1	0	1	4	3	0	1	331	D&N Haveli and Daman & Diu+	4	3	0	3	2	1	0	9	1	2	0	332	Delhi	36	33	0	248	78	51	2	274	70	62	0	33033	Jammu & Kashmir*	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	034	Ladakh	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	0	0	0	035	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	036	Puducherry	0	0	0	28	4	0	0	28	0	0	0	28 	TOTAL UT(S)	42	38	0	285	88	52	3	316	81	67	1	364 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	49064	40169	3923	174931	53515	40658	4748	193149	58538	45610	3588	223017Source: Crime in India	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Note : ''+'' Combined data of erstwhile D&N Haveli UT and Daman & Diu UT during 2018 & 2019*'' Data of erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir State including Ladakh during  2018 & 2019*****
