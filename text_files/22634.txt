                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c):  No Sir, Air India''s reservation, ticketing and check-in services are hosted on a third party service provider and are functioning satisfactorily.;(d): Because of COVID-19 and related issues of  flight cancellations and drying up of funds from future sale, Air India is following a regulated and phased approach for refunding the customers who had booked on flights which were cancelled. Further, there was an impact on revenue streams of the airline due to the complete stoppage of flights during lockdown period whereas fixed costs had to be incurred.  In view of this unprecedented situation, Air India instead of processing automatic refunds in Global Sales Distribution, processed refunds only through Air India''s own offices within pre-assigned budgeted amount. Refunds on cancellation of air tickets during COVID-19 lockdown are being processed as per circular issued by DGCA No. 4/1/2020-IR dated 07.10.2020, which was issued pursuant to the Hon''ble Supreme Court of India''s order in the case of Pravasi Legal Cell vs Union Of India directing the airlines to issue refund.;The ticket refund is an ongoing process and is being processed by Air India regularly.
