This led to an estimated energy savings of 7.75 BU per year.  EESL replaces the conventional street lights with energy efficient LEDs street lights at its own costs (without any need for municipalities to invest) and the consequent reduction in energy and maintenance cost of the municipality is used to repay EESL over a period of time.
