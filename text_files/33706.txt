(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The State Government is primarily responsible for managing and undertaking necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities, including drought, hailstorm and pest attack.

Based on the Reports of the IMCT and the recommendations of Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC), the Government of India approved financial assistance of Rs.1280.18 crore to Madhya Pradesh for pest attack and Rs.113.69 crore to Rajasthan for drought. During the current year i.e. 2021-22, the State Governments of Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have submitted Memorandums seeking financial assistance from NDRF for hailstorm and drought respectively. As per the existing procedure, based on the report of the IMCT and the recommendations of the SC-NEC thereon, the Government of India approves assistance from NDRF*****
