                                                        (a)	and (b):   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA  STARRED QUESTION NO. *236  FOR 10-03-2021REGARDING HATE SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA..........(a)	and (b):  Cyber space is a complex environment of people, software, hardware and services on the Internet providing a possibility of instant communication by anyone from anywhere around the world. The global outreach of social media platforms to allow interaction among internet users for sharing, hosting, storing, transmitting user content has increased tremendously. Because of such features, specifically the option to remain anonymous, there are certain miscreants who use hateful and divisive language on social media platforms.''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects as per the Constitution of India and States are primarily responsible for prevention, detection and investigation through their law enforcement machinery. The Law Enforcement Agencies take legal action against the cyber-crime offenders as per the provisions of applicable laws. Wherever the situation warrants, under the provision of section 69A of the Information Technology  Act, 2000, Government blocks unlawful and malicious online content, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above. Under this provision, 1385, 2799, 3603 and 9849 URLs/accounts/webpages were blocked during the years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.Government has recently notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, in which many of these issues have been addressed. The social media platforms are enjoined to develop a robust grievance redressal system.********
