                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT.

The concerned Ministries/Departments and State Governments/UTs have been requested to provide action taken/proposed to be taken/reasons for non-acceptance on the concerned recommendations made by NCST. The Action Taken Reports from the few concerned Central Ministries/Departments and State Governments/UTs are not received . The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is taking all out efforts to expedite these reports at the earliest (d) As per Clause 6 of Article 338 A of the Constitution, the President shall cause all such reports to be laid before each House of Parliament, along with a memorandum explaining action taken or proposed to be taken on recommendations relating to Union and reasons for non-acceptance, if any, of any of such recommendations.For preparation of the Explanatory Memorandum on the Annual Reports of NCST, the  concerned Central Ministries / Departments were requested to furnish necessary information / replies. Apart from this, it was also necessary to coordinate with State Governments to take action on the report in terms of clause 7 of Article 338 (A) of the Constitution. The preparation of Explanatory Action Taken Memorandum on the recommendations  of NCST involves compilation of the replies received from all the concerned central Ministries/Departments and State Governments/UTs and this process of receiving replies from all of them takes time and hence results in delay.
