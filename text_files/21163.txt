The Government has launched SVAMITVA, a Central Sector Scheme with the aim to provide an integrated property validation solution by demarcation of rural abadi areas using Drone Surveying technology, with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Panchayati Raj Departments, State Revenue Departments and Survey of India (SoI). The pilot phase of the scheme is being implemented during 2020-21 in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. From 2021-2025, the Scheme would be implemented across the country in phased manner and would eventually cover all the villages of the country including State of West Bengal. Under the scheme, funds to SoI have been provided for two components: Large Scale Mapping (LSM) and establishment of Continuous Operating Reference Station (CORS). Funds have also been provided to States for Information, Education, Communication (IEC) and setting up of State Project Monitoring Unit.  The State-wise details of funds sanctioned, villages covered and Property Cards distributed under the scheme is at Annexure-I.(f) 	Survey of rural land in India for settlement and record of rights had last been completed many decades back and moreover, rural inhabitated lands were not surveyed/mapped in many States.  Under the SVAMITVA scheme, it is envisaged to facilitate creation of durable record of property holdings in rural areas where no proper legacy records exist through high resolution and accurate image based maps.*****
