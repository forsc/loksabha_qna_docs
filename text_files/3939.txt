                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a)	to (d):	Reforms in labour laws are an ongoing process to update the legislative system to address the need of the hour so as to make them more effective, flexible and in sync with emerging Contd..2/-:: 2 ::economic and industrial scenario. The Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security; and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. These initiatives will reduce the complexity in compliance due to multiplicity of labour laws and facilitate setting up of enterprises and thus creating the environment for development of business and industry in the country and generating employment opportunities without diluting basic aspects of safety, security and health of workers. 			This Ministry has not received any research report in the name of  ‘Ecowrap’ from the State Bank of India on Labour Reforms.(e) & (f):	A Draft National Policy on Domestic Workers is under consideration of the Central Government.  The salient features of the proposed draft National Policy on Domestic Workers are as under:-(i) Inclusion of Domestic Workers  in the existing legislations(ii) Domestic workers will have the right to register as unorganized   workers. Such registration will facilitate their access to rights & benefits.(iii) Right to form their own associations/unions.(iv) Right to minimum wages, access to social security.(v) Right to enhance their skills.(vi) Protection of Domestic Workers from abuse and exploitation.(vii) Domestic Workers to have access to courts, tribunals for grievance redressal.(viii) Establishment of a mechanism for regulation of private placement agencies.(ix)Establishment of a grievance redressal system for domestic workers.******
