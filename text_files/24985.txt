                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (f): The Anganwadi Services, a centrally sponsored scheme being implemented through the State Governments/UT Administrations. The Scheme aims at holistic development of children below 6 years of age and pregnant women & lactating mothers. It provides a package of six services comprising of (i) supplementary nutrition; (ii) pre-school non-formal education; (iii) nutrition and health education; (iv) immunization; (v) health check-up; and (vi) referral services. Three of the six services viz., immunization, health check-up and referral services are related to health and are provided by NRHM & Public Health Infrastructure. Inter-sectoral convergence is inbuilt and integral to the Anganwadi Services Scheme. The States/UTs have been directed to provide Take Home Ration at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries once in 15 days due to closure of Anganwadi Centres during the COVID 19 pandemic.As per census 2011 data, the sex ratio for India is 943 females to 1000 males which translate to 48.5% females in the country. Further, as per the vaccination coverage reported on Co-WIN as on 07.07.2021, out of 35.89 crore vaccinations done across the country, a total of 16.63 crore vaccinations were of women i.e.46.32% of the total vaccinations. The difference of approximately 2% between estimated proportion of females and proportion of vaccinations of females could be due to earlier guidelines which had mentioned pregnancy and lactation as contra-indications for COVID-19 vaccination. However, subsequent to review of evolving scientific evidence, COVID-19 vaccination has been allowed for lactating women from 19.05.2021 and for pregnant women from 02.07.2021. The COVID-19 vaccination drive does not make any discrimination on the basis of gender, socio-economic conditions or residence etc of citizens.***
