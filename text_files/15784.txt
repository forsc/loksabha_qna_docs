ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d)  There are two types of rivers in the country; (1) perennial rivers and (2) Non-perennial rivers. In perennial rivers, water remains available throughout the year, while non-perenial rivers are rain fed rivers in which water flows only during the rainfall period. The flow in the rivers is dynamic and depends on many parameters such as rainfall, its distribution and intensity in the catchment, catchment characteristics and withdrawals/ utilisation of water in the basin. Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors important rivers in the country. Considering annual average flow of last 20 years of terminal sites of important rivers, no appreciable increasing/decreasing trend in total water availability has been observed. Government has taken water conservation initiatives especially under Jal Shakti Abhiyan through the process of rain water harvesting.Discharge of untreated and partly treated sewage and industrial effluent along with dumping of solid waste are the major reasons for pollution in rivers. It is the primary responsibility of the State Governments / Union territories to provide necessary sewerage infrastructure, treat and thereafter discharge the sewage into water bodies & rivers and keep them clean. Similarly, the States / ULBs are to provide facilities for proper collection; transportation and management of solid waste and prevent it from polluting rivers & water bodies etc. 	River cleaning is a continuous process and the Central Government is supplementing the efforts of State Governments and Union Territories in river rejuvenation through programmes like “Namami Gange” and “National River Conservation Plan”.Contd…P/2//2//State Governments, apart from their own budgetary allocation, are also accessing financial assistance for creation of sewerage infrastructure, including Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), in various cities/towns under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.Besides, CPCB had issued direction on 21.04.2015 to the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 for proper collection, transportation and treatment of sewage generated in urban areas in their respective States. CPCB also issued directions on 09.10.2015 to Local Authorities under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to local authorities of metropoliten cities, State capitals and towns along Ganga to ensure proper treatment and disposal of sewage in accordance with the stipulated standards. 		Further, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. *****
