The budget allocation under MGNREGA during the last three financial years is as under:                                                  (Rs. in crore)Financial Year	           Budget Allocation	     Revised Allocation2016-17	                      38500.00	                48220.262017-18	                      48000.00	                55167.062018-19	                      55000.00	                61830.09(b):	No, Sir. However, an additional 50 days of wage employment are provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. (c) & (d):	There are 260 works which are permissible under MGNREGA of which 164 works relate to agriculture and allied activities. MGNREGA already lays emphasis that atleast 60% of works at district level in terms of cost shall be for creation of productive assets directly linked to Agriculture and Allied Activities which include works related to water security like construction of farm ponds, wells, earthen check dam, field channels and other water harvesting structures. MGNREGA is for providing a fall back option for livelihood security to the rural poor and is not a regular employment scheme. The Act provides that works which are non-tangible, not measurable and repetitive such as removing grass, pebbles, and agricultural operations shall not be taken up.*****
