                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)	to (e) A Statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO *76 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 02.12.2021 REGARDING “WATER STORAGE CAPACITY”.(a) Total water requirement of the country for different uses, for high demand scenario, for the year 2025 and 2050 has been assessed by National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD)-1999 at 843 billion cubic meters (BCM) and 1,180 BCM, respectively.(b) to (e) Yes. Since there is a substantial variation in temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall in India, there is a need for storage of water in the country. As per information available with Central Water Commission (CWC), the gross and live storage capacity created due to the completed projects in the entire country is 325.455 BCM and 249.093 BCM, respectively.CWC made an assessment of average annual water availability (1985-2015) in the country at 1,999.2 BCM, out of which, the utilizable water is 1,126 BCM (comprising 690 BCM of surface water and 436 BCM of replenishable ground water), owing to topographic, hydrological and other constraints.As per the erstwhile Planning Commission''s "Report of the Working Group on Water Resources for the Xlth Five Year Plan ( 2007-2012)", for harnessing of 690 BCM of utilizable surface water, it is estimated that live storage capacity of about 450 BCM is required.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.There are significant reserves of water underground. Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by CGWB in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions cf the country. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country to harness 185 BCM of monsoon rainfall. The "Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India - 2020" is available at http://cgwb.gov.in/Whatisnew/2021-06-30-Final-Approved %20Master%20Plan%202020-00002. pdfHon''ble Prime Minister of India launched the "Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain" (JSA:CTR) on 22 March, 2021, the World Water Day, with the theme "Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls". The abhiyan is aimed at creating appropriate rainwater harvesting structures in urban and rural areas of all the districts in the country, with people''s active participation during 22 March, 2021 to 30 November, 2021 — the pre-monsoon and monsoon period.During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium Irrigation (MMI) projects under PMKSY-AIBP, having balance estimated cost of Rs. 77,595 crore (with central assistance component of Rs. 31,342 crore), have been prioritized in consultation with States for completion in phases. Out of these, AIBP works of 46 projects have been reported to be completed.*****
